            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached] Kong Haizhu: 'Father was a leakage net big right' [2009.3.13]\\nAfter writing down this topic, has not moved the pen, want to say a lot of words but do not know where to say, the mood is very messy, the mood is also very bad. The words 'leak the big right' are only available in China, and it is difficult to imagine how such a word could be created if it was not a constant political movement. Since the net is leaked, it is not the right, where still exists the truth that both the net leakage and the great right? However, the phrase is a very qualitative hat that is bigger and more abominable than the right-wing hat. I can say with certainty that in the Shanghai publishing system, only my father has this 'honor' to qualify-wearing this hat. During the Cultural Revolution, the slogan 'knocking down the big right hole in the other border' is a big slogan written on the Shaoxing road, it is striking, because it occupies almost all the width of this road, that black ink is to let pedestrians stepped on it, because this cattle ghost must be down to the ground and step on one foot. \\nThat year's revelation\\nIt should be said that in March 1957, his father represented the Shanghai publishing community to Beijing to attend the central propaganda work conference. This meeting is one in which the Central Committee encouraged 'to enlarge' and 'help the Party to rectify'. At the end of the meeting, his father said in his sister Kong Deyu and his sister Maodun's family, 'This conference was very encouraged...' he seemed to have led the spirit of the 'holy tenet' and was ready to carry out after returning to Shanghai. Sister and brother-in-law advised him: 'You should be careful and say more bad. Say less is wonderful!' (Italy), They know that the father's heart is fast, rushing out, every time it seems to reach the 'words are not surprising' situation, so that they will suffer. His father promised his mouth, but did not keep it in mind. Afterwards, he regretted to us that this movement did not listen to the words of his sister and brother-in-law, and had spoken much. They had long seen that it was going to suffer evil, and now it also caused trouble to them. \\nIn that year, his father was deputy director of the editorial department in Shanghai Cultural Publishing House (I recently asked the old culture publishing house by phone and told him, the leader of Shanghai Culture Publishing House was Hu Yan, Li Xiaofeng was the head of the editorial department, and his father was deputy director of the editorial department, equivalent to the deputy editor). After attending the National Publicity Conference, he returned to the Shanghai Publicity Workshop, where he made a speech on popular literature and art. 'Big Ming' soon entered the anti-right rectification stage. As the first target of our company, Kong was forced to check the accounts at countless small meetings and write self-review nearly 100,000 words. However, the character is straightforward, open and open hole attitude is tough, facing pressure, nothing is determined not to acknowledge. \\nNow, from his father's examination, you can know what exactly he sounded? \\nHis review of his right-wing speech has the following points:\\n1, 'Dongfeng overwhelmingly westerly' problem. On one occasion, he said at the study conference: 'Now the international revolutionary situation is clearly at a low tide. If the situation is good, it is still the Dongfeng overwhelmingly westerly wind, it will inevitably become a Q-spirit victory.' He reviewed that this is not only a false judgment on the international situation, but also because the comparison of 'Dongfeng overwhelmingly west-wind' was proposed by Chairman Mao in 1953 and became my slander of Chairman Mao. \\n2, 'personal superstition' problem. One day, he went to the CPPCC to study, and met a working comrade over there and said to talk to him, he talked about personal superstition. The man asked, 'Do you see China?' He did not simply answer at that time, but he did feel a little bit in his heart. The target of course was Chairman Mao. \\n3, 'the lay can not lead the insiders, experts run the society' issue. At that time, the leader of Shanghai Culture Publishing House was Hu Yan. Huang Jiayin, in the society, insisted that 'laymen cannot lead the internal business'; Li Xiaofeng prepared expert offices, organized various symposia, discussed the branch affairs, and the list was opened, and invited guests. The father said, 'I was a head at the cultural publishing house. They took care of them, and they didn't put me on their list. That means, I wouldn't put them under their fence, and they expected me to come to an 'independent kingdom' as well. One night, a party member and cadre came to my house and encouraged me not to go behind and engage in one, and I rejected his' kindness'.' However, he reviews: 'I also have this kind of ideological activity. I am in favor of the fact that the outsiders cannot lead the insiders; I also feel it should be for experts.' \\n4, a series of misperceptions of the socialist social system. There are three points of representation for bourgeois democracy: first, democratic elections; second, parliamentary politics; and thirdly, a free market for talent. All had a thought check. \\n5, in the press conference held by the municipal committee of the People's Jin Municipal Committee, attached to the proposal of 'abolishing the seat system'. A joint initiative with Zhou Xuliang and others to set up a 'Association of Publishers'. At a forum on the issue of contributions held by the municipal CPPCC, it was also in favor of raising the draft fee standard. He criticized himself as a manifestation of liberalisation in the bourgeoisie ideology. And so on. \\n6, on some theoretical issues of 'joint repair anti-imperialism', 'weapons only theory' and other understanding also checked. \\nMore than a year later, although the hole was not designated as the right, but the 'leakage net big right' hat has been followed by him, the movements are constantly focused on criticizing. As a result, he checks the accounts, while constantly complaining, his energy and vigor are draining. \\nRight Leakage\\nOne material has been disclosed in the Cultural Revolution, the Shanghai Cultural Publishing House, 'Anti-Right Events'. The material was seen by his father, and he personally extracted some of his content about himself, in a total of five items. This copy in my file folder, may wish to transcribe, can also see some of the Shanghai publishing system at the time of the anti-right movement:\\n27 March 1957\\nThe great winds movement began, with a group of Li Xiaofeng, Kong, Xu Junyuan, Huang Jiayin and other groups within the company, using the opportunity of the Party's winding, spreading myths, spreading fallacies and rampant attacks against the party. At a colloquium held by the Ministry of Information, Kong openly stated that 'only by developing more members of a few democratic parties can there be forces to supervise each other.' He also said: 'The transfer of private parties is generally deputy, with no authority.' 'Personnel materials are made public and decisions relating to personnel shall be consulted with the editorial department.' ...\\n20 June\\nOur agency's fight against the right, the more flames burned, posted a large number of large print newspapers, denouncing the bourgeois right-wing elements, Kong's other border under the cover of Shi Ximin, and slipped into Suzhou to 'create' in order to fight against the right fight against the right. In his letter to the leading group of winds, he said arrogously: 'going to Suzhou is a 'move away from the ground, is nurturing and writing.' Blatantly cursing the whole society's revolutionary masses to fight him is 'bustle'. \\n21 June\\nOur leading group sent a letter to Chen Bing, deputy minister of propaganda department of the old municipal committee committee, and Tang Jihong, deputy director of the Publishing Bureau, reflecting the views of the Trade Union Committee on Kong's rebellion resistance movement, and asked the staff of the whole community to repudiate Kong's anti-party words and actions. On July 2, the Shanghai publishing system leading group said nonsense to Kong another border: 'Kong has not yet found any anti-party activity in politics, and on certain occasions it can also express support for the Party's policy.' On the other hand, he had to say, 'but hole's poor quality, serious individualism, and dissatisfaction with the party in his usual words and deeds', the conclusion was: 'whether it is classified as right-wing, it is worth reconsidering. The false words and deeds of holes should continue to be strictly criticized, and their creation falsehood does not stop.' \\n21 October\\nThe publication bureau winds office instructed: 'Your shocong left the border, after research by the propaganda department leading group, decided not to be listed as the right.' \\n25 October\\nAccording to the request of the revolutionary masses of the whole society, the leadership group of our company pointed out to the Bureau's Office: 'The other border should be classified as the right.' And the Bureau of the Wind Office still instructed: 'Still according to the opinion of the Ministry of Communications, not the right.' So the hole bypass the clearance. \\nIn paragraph 5 above, it is fully explained that the anti-right movement in 1957 in cultural publishing houses, the grass-roots level reported several times to the Publication Bureau Office and the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee. It is said that at that time the list of 18 right-wing right-wing hats was reported to be the first place. However, only the other person on the other border did not approve. The superiors believe that 'Kong has not yet found any anti-party activities in politics, and on some occasions, can also express support for the Party's policy', insisted that 'still according to the opinion of the Ministry of propaganda, not the right', and the remaining 17 people all wear a hat. In this way, the hole is not wearing a right-wing hat. This is the origin of the word 'leakage'. \\nThe father was not aware of the process. He was the first to be criticized in the movement of cultural publishing houses led by Hu Yan. I remember going home from work at night, when my father often closed the door to the den, or someone came to inform, or adults discussed how to check the clearance and not let our children eavesdropping. However, we can always feel that adults are nervous, even the voice of speaking is much smaller. Later, his father also prepared his family to leave Shanghai to Qinghai. Because most of the right-wing elements were sent to Qinghai Province at that time. Therefore, his father was sympathetic to some of the cultural people who returned from Qinghai later and helped them, because he was as 'guilty' as they did and did not accompany them to suffer in Qinghai. If he was also allotted to Qinghai at that time, he would certainly not be able to stand it. This is what he often said to me, and for that, he thanked the 'leakage'. However, in the days to come, he was not mentally suffering less or more intense than the already hat-wore right. Because of the constant movement, you can always re-wear him. \\nDuring the work of the published literature editor, the leader was Fang Xuemu. At that time, the string of 'class struggle' was very tight, and the spear had always been identified, so that many people in the area felt to 'ostensibly call you 'comrade comrades', while their hearts always call you 'enemy enemy '', not chilling To give one example: the leadership of the time was targeted around a group of so-called 'problematic' objects, including his father's 'large number of 'scouts' around, which weave your words into a 'anti-revolutionary 'proof'. This is not a false argument in the big criticism. My classmates were assigned to this unit, arranged to sit in classes opposite my father, and set up a task for him to pay attention to the movement of Kong's other border, and even meet with what guests, call with whom, also report to their superiors, and regularly ask them to know' Object dynamic. This agent act, pay attention to your word and act 'class movement', effectively in the hands of the masses, at any time you can criticize you. Because you are not wearing a hat, you can wear it again at any time. The father said: 'If you were a person who was not obscure, their success would be faster, so that once they weave success, even you don't feel, they have been designated as 'counter-revolutionary', 'right-wing,' or 'agents of collusion with foreign countries.' Living in such an environment and atmosphere, physical and mental depression is self-evident. \\nDuring the anti-right period, the father said that the impact was very bad, and I was later confirmed by Mr. Song Yuanfang. In his old age, Song Yuan lived in the ordinary dormitory of China Normal University. On one occasion, I visited him and asked him to talk about his father. They visited the Summer Palace in 1957 while they went to Beijing to attend a publicity work conference, and they had a 6-inch photo at home. Because there was an agreement in advance, so, without saying a few words, Song Yuanfang remembers his father's words of 'moving away from the place'. He was excited to introduce that his father's letter said that 'moving away' was outrage. After everyone looked at his sentence, it was a frying pan, and there was a lot of discussion. At that time, the campaign was intense, and you say this is tantamount to negating the movement, saying that the masses fight against him is 'bustle'. You can see that this sentence impressed Song Yuan Fang very deeply. Said we all laughed. Father is a person with a very personality. Speak very untimely, only take care of their personal feelings, speedily, no city. Now want to come, this bold word, in such a high-pressure situation at the time, deafening is not only deep, but also rare. He fully expressed his disdain about the anti-right movement. \\nAt that time, the bristling office repeatedly instructed: 'Still according to the opinion of the Ministry of Communications, not the right.' The reason is: 'Kong has not yet found any anti-party activity in politics, and on certain occasions it can also express support for the Party's policy.' This statement stems from the leadership of the Ministry of Advocacy to understand the glorious history of his father, who was born to death for the revolution. Learn that he embraces the new China and loves the new China. There is also a statement in the folk, and a number of people have recently asked me for proof:\\n'Your father used to work with Mao Zedong, a good relationship? Also playing cards together?' He also said: 'When it comes to the right, someone denounced this is bragging, not believing, and slandering Chairman Mao. It's right-wing speech.' I said to this man, this is true. However, it is not clear that the father is in the interest of his father to say that history is true, or does it harm himself? \\nHe was pleased to have leaked the net. In fact, his political life ended. \\nIn 1986, Mao Dun Institute held an international symposium in Nanjing, where a senior research expert of Mao Dun, Czech Sinologist Golik also attended. The first time I saw him, after he learned my surname, asked me, did you know the other border? Is he okay? When I told him my identity, he was happy and regretted not able to visit the father, because during the 'Cultural Revolution' the father had died. Admitting him to complain, he went to Shanghai to visit his father while collecting data from Mao Dun in China in 1958. But it was rejected by the parties concerned. What exactly is going on? I would love to know. So offered the meeting break to visit him with a recorder, and he accepted. \\nHe said that in that year he went from Beijing to Shanghai and asked the Shanghai Writers Association to visit Kong another border. The one who received him was Wang Mou. I know that Wang Mu is a teacher of the Chinese Department of Fudan University. Wang told Golik: 'This person has serious problems during the anti-right movement, and it is not advisable to meet.' Rejected him. Then he asked for a second time to see his brother Kong Lingjie. The brother he saw. Golik said: 'The other border has a deeper relationship with Mao Dun, and in many historical times he was a witness. It is a pity to lose the opportunity to meet.' \\nI was strange that my father was not wearing a right-wing hat at that time. It should not be a contradiction against me! But it is true that the political influence of the anti-right movement has had him badly, 'treatment' is no different from the right, foreign affairs are incapable of participating and untrusted people. As mentioned above, only one example I know. \\nCultural Revolution\\nIn the early days of the Cultural Revolution, the back door of my house was affixed to such a large print of the title of 'Strongly Warning of Leaking the Net Right Hole Out' This thing was not a rare thing in that very age, and had been used to the big print newspaper on the line. However, there is something in this big print, and it makes me remember something. So, after so many years, why should I take these things out? Because this hat is a half-life misfortune for himself, his political life ends, and endless scrutiny and criticism have drained his life in the years of life. The influence on our children is too great, and we are constantly asked to draw the line of thought with him and to recognize his reactionary nature. In particular, I work with my father in the publishing system, which spreads to my entry into the regiment, to participate in the Basic Militia, etc., and so on. Such conformations put a great burden on my heart asking for progress; the feeling of inferiority has also given me to honing my growth in the living space at the bottom of my living space. Fortunately, there is a policy that gives a way, and then to reinvent yourself... subjected to such spiritual torture, divides, grievances, and even resentments between the two generations continue to arise in real life. \\nFirst look at the signed 'Revolutionary Press' this big print posted on the back door of my house, the contents are as follows:\\nThe leaking net of the Great Right and Hole has always had a deep hatred of the Party towards socialism, and viciously cursed our great Party and great leader Chairman Mao, and the people were outraged with great indignation. In 1957, the anti-revolutionary revisionist Shi Ximin and Bai Yan sheltered the customs clearance. When we suffered three years of natural disasters in our country, they even intensified their exaggerations, carried out a frenzy attack on our party and our government, causing great indignation among the masses, and they have made requests to put him strictly on the path of capitalism. Fang Xuewu, using false criticism to protect its shelter customs clearance. \\nIn this great proletarian cultural revolution, the Red Guards copied his home, grew up the people's ambition to destroy the enemy's masses. We revolutionary masses could not clap their hands fast, but the hole was not dead. When society was shaking up the wind, he was stupid and moved, and wrote an 'angry complaint' To wipe out our country's 17 years of brilliant achievements, to our company Red Guards The revolutionary masses counter-attack count, openly yelling to him to apologize and plead guilty, class enemies crazy to the extreme. \\nIn order to resolutely repel the reversals of class enemies and to face a headache for the reversal of the counter-revolution, the revolutionary masses of our society have struggled out holes to the other border, expose their reactionary face with pain and expose them, and completely defeated him, beat, and stink. \\nWe ask him to report his ideas once a month to the residents' committee, and honestly obey the supervision of the residents' committee and not to defy. \\nI hope that the masses will strictly supervise the other border of the hole. \\nThe 450-word large print has no date, and should be after 27 February 1967, because he went on a crutch to publish his own small print, 'The Wrath Complaint,' which was handed down by the editor of the literature, which led to another copy of the family and the big print. The new name of the 'Revolutionary Press', the editorial office of published literature, after being smashed by the revolutionary villain. The editorial was definitely canceled after the 'Cultural Revolution'. This is another topic. \\nOur family was copied on August 31, 1966. This thing is still fresh in memory, because I opened the door late that night, and after a period of instruction began to rab my father's home, but the books and objects of my pavilion cottage were also searched, and I checked my diary and personal letters. I am a revolutionary masses, I have been working for 5 years, and should be treated differently from my father, to talk about policy, this is my idea. When I expressed this dissatisfaction with the leaders of the rebelievers, they thought I was bad and did not support this revolutionary action. The next day, when my unit posted my first big print newspaper, shouting me, this filial son and grandson. In this regard, I also became the object of being affixed to a large print in the unit. This is another topic too. \\nSo, why did the father want to fight after the original copy of his family? In the book 'My Examination', he said that he was disobedient at that time, only on crutches to publish his own small print, which was handed down by the editor of the literature, later, the unit copied it into a large print, and then caused dissatisfaction among the revolutionary masses. Invoked tougher criticism and house plundering, and posted this big print in the back door downstairs after the house. My father, out of self-esteem, did not look carefully at the contents of the big print. He said to his son, You go and transcribe these texts, I need to know what is written on it? That's why this original record was kept. After the big print newspaper was posted, the familiar neighbor in Lili quietly persuaded us: 'To Kong Jiabo, he said that the intellectual affairs person is Junjie, why should I go to make senseless resistance.' After this word was passed to his father, he sighed and said, 'There is really no place to speak.' He was a temper and very pudious. \\nIt is important to know that the whole group of people at that time felt misfortune. It seemed that there was no justice, no humanity, for too long, enough for a decade. Some are unhumiliated and fought with suicide early; some nerve disorder, buried the future... And my father is not, he wants to fight, he wants to speak, die hard to the end. His personality made him pay a greater price. Remember,He also wanted to change his 'cannon' temper,Speak to moderation,In the corner of the wall of the study,Personally wrote the word 'cautious words' with a brush,Always remind himself not to talk。 But it wasn't much useful, he himself knew that soon he torn the note... and then again, if he wasn't this personality, he wouldn't be my father. \\nNow that 37 years after the death of the father and the children have reached the age of retirement, there is little merit in pursuing this matter. It is time, is the looser political environment that gives me the right and responsibility to trace history, solve the mystery, what exactly is the reactionary right-wing speech of my father?

It should be the Communist Party of China, not the Communist Party of China. \\n2, patriotic, guduojia words. Humanity does not start today. So because of the patriotic party, not because of the party patriotic, patriotic. \\n3, dashing is like putting a whistle kite, put high, ringing. But the kite-flying line is manpower. To be issued, to receive. \\n4, people's thoughts like spring grass, can not be destroyed, grow continuously. Poems: wildfires are not exhaustible, spring breeze blows and brews \\n5, the masses, the masses go. Begin between the parties there are ditches and walls. Party Ling group, can not be expected, respectable. \\n6. Previously speaking of the Communist Party, the Kuomintang tax, now both. There are meetings that can be completed, no taxes paid. \\nAnti-socialist\\n1, listen to Professor Zhou Yuanbing report: socialism is not afraid of many people. With a population of 800 million, our country has reached 1.6 billion in a few years, with more strength and greater confidence in building socialism. However, he did not speak of how strong people, belly, the amount of rice is large, so many people, what to eat? \\n2, the report says: the United States overproduction, economic crisis, not more than a few years, will perish. They pour the remaining milk in the river and do not give the poor to drink. We are better than them, milk is not prolific, and the poor do not drink. \\n3, several reports to give an example, the American factory invented fluorescent lamp technology, hidden for many years, secretly not produced, in order to fear the impact of bulb sales. System decay, stifling progress. We produce goods for many years, no need to have this concern. Such as a sewing machine, thermos, etc. Grandma met like seeing the dowry that year, without confidentiality. \\n4, capitalist market games competition, unplanned, product forced to fight, pattern renovation. Workers are exploited, living in poverty, unable to afford something, new, or overproductive, often in crisis. Our national chess, all products, people's life is excellent, clothing and food, only because of the diligent, do not buy good things, new things. So there is no need to produce good things, new things. \\n5, listen to the report, before the liberation of Henan customs, landowners have the right to early night, tenants to marry the bride to be sent by him priority. I'm a northerner and never knew the local owner was so good. Now well, Henan has destroyed landowners. Farmers are no longer afraid of the right to the first night, but they can't afford to marry their daughter-in-law. \\nAnti-Marxism\\n1. All things in the world are constantly developing and progress, anti-Marxism should be no exception. For a few years, Marx must have more hereditary works, updated in 'Capitalism. If he is resurrected today, he must complain about why everything is allowed to develop, only his mind does not allow development. \\n2, Marx from Europe to look at social development, five production methods are natural. Now affirmatively, the world is no exception, as is China. There were decent slaves in China, but there was no slaver-based production method. Before liberation, China was a semi-feudal semi-colonial society, and where was capitalist society? \\n3, labor time is the only measure that determines the value of goods. Price fluctuates up and down around the value. Excavated cultural relics are of great value; production of the same product at the same time, because of quality and disadvantages affect the value; urban development of real estate value, such as supply and demand reactionary, does not work, how to reflect the only measure of this decisive value? \\n4, capitalists brutally exploit workers, take up residual value, capitalists are poor, workers are poor and miserable, so the working class will rise up revolution, capitalism self-digging graves. It is not known whether American workers are willing to go to China to take ownership or whether Chinese workers are willing to go to the United States for exploitation. \\nFansu\\n[During the war of resistance, I saw the Soviet Volunteer Army Air Force coming to China to help war, with strict discipline, outstanding service and deep admiration. After the victory, the Soviet army's actions in the northeast led me to change my perception of the Soviet Union. After liberation, one side down, the Soviet Union became the elder brother, providing me with assistance called selfless, which actually accounted for a lot of economic cheap. The country has suffered losses and thanks for the gift. Moving away the Tohoku machine left behind in Japan was described as a just act. On one occasion, on a train, I saw the Soviet Air Force board at a station in Shandong in the middle of the night, dispersing Chinese passengers who were already sleeping on the sleeper car, forcibly occupying the bunks and alcoholics. In that year, the US military did not seem to be overriding in China. Together with the excessive rendering of the rich and beautiful life of the Soviet people, the impractical extolation touting, led me to believe that the past of the Soviet Union is a loss of national self-esteem. Brother with his own behavior, no one's arrogant arrogance, has seen much, dissenting and benefiting. For this reason, anti-Soviet speeches are often made, so that the pro-Soviet people listened very uncomfortable. I dare not satisfied with this life, and I am called anti-Soviet experts. In fact, my anti-Soviet anti-Soviet, patriotic self-esteem, disgust comes from the negative reaction caused by excessive pro-Soviet.] \\n1, often heard that today of the Soviet Union is our tomorrow, we looked at the Soviet Union today, hope we do not have tomorrow. \\n2. Any Chinese intellectuals who have a conscience, followed by touting the big brother's incomparable affection. Before touting, it is better to ask your conscience. \\n3, seeing the Soviet boss, I firmly believe that people are monkeys change. \\n4, Soviet watch sales publicity ensure that the time difference is not more than five minutes a day, the Chinese can wear to change the meeting late problems. \\n5. I often say a Soviet political joke, listening to foreign nationals from Shanghai. \\nIn the Kremlin, there is a hall with portraits of every Russian inventor claiming cutting-edge scientific inventions in the world, detailing that these are the world's first great Russian inventors to invent airplanes, radios, lights, telephones, cars, cannons, radium, atomic bombs, Penicillin, etc. People visit appreciated. There is also a larger hall behind the hall, magnificent and unparalleled. At the end of the hall, a huge portrait of the world's greatest inventor, Khrushchev, who first invented the foyer. \\n6. Another political joke that I often say is also listening to foreign nationals in Shanghai. \\nShanghai Belarus was ordered to return to China in batches, pending return to Belarus with suspicion. One Belarus secretly agreed when sending off to a friend that after returning to the Soviet Union, if life was as good as propaganda, it would return as a standing image; if life was not good, just follow a sitting image. A few months later, in Shanghai and Belarus received a photo from a friend as agreed: lying on the ground. \\n7. The Soviet Union helped Mongolian independence, make China's map from big and small; help the Baltic countries to be integrated into the Soviet Union independently, and small countries became big powers. \\n8, the report says Soviet workers live well, everyone has a car. It seems that American workers are wasted and cars are driving in the streets. Soviet workers knew saving, cars were kept at home, so they could not see each car on the road. \\n9. Without looking at the Soviet Union's aid to China, I don't understand what is selfless. They threw exports from China to international markets at lower prices than China, helping us reduce the hassle of self-selling, shipping, and remittances. \\n10, Beijing opened a Moscow restaurant, in addition to the name is completely authentic national goods. But the newspaper reported that the Russian dishes in Moscow restaurants are fine and delicious. The dish is bright red tomatoes, turquoise cucumbers. I read a deep sense of meat and hemp. I said: It must be the reporter wrote it wrong. Both Moscow, should be turquoise tomatoes and bright red cucumbers. \\n11, the people of the Soviet Union have a good life and affluent, that is, forgot to export a group of red gangang tailors to China, and do a few decent suits for them. \\n12, after liberation, Japan surrendered completely because the Soviet Union declared war two days earlier, crashed the Kanto army. The United States had long known that it should not have dropped atomic bombs on Japan before the Soviet declaration of war, killing so many people in white. \\nOther\\n1. Hu Feng nonsense that Chinese public opinion is all. I said that my country has no public opinion, what is it all. \\n2, the West is a fake democracy, and then the election. We are true democracy and do not choose. \\n3, the proverb says: become the king, defeat is Kou. That is not the right thing. Like Li Zicheng failed to become the great hero of the glorified peasant uprising. Who dare to say he is Kou. He scored in Beijing, and the butt hasn't yet been seated and called Emperor Dashun If successful, it becomes a reactionary emperor. How lucky and failed, today as a farmer hero. I believe that if this great man was to choose himself, he would be willing to emperor that day, not today's hero. [Excerpt from Kong lingpeng: 'Stormy Life']\\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attachment 2】Kong lingpeng: My Doom-'Anti-Right' and 'Cultural Revolution' Remarks (Bo News 2007)\\nFirst, the nature is difficult to move the truth\\n'sincerity' is a wonderful word in the text of any nation. Truth is the most basic moral requirement for human life. The education I received from my family, school, and society since an early age is that I do not say false words. Whoever could not think of the heavens are unpredictable, and I have sinned through 22 years of ruthless torment. At the same time, how many people have suffered, either intentionally or unintentionally, by saying a few words, or even just one or two truths, determining the hard and painful years of a lifetime. \\nAn unprecedented anti-right campaign has been launched in China since the summer of 1957. Surprise the earth, grass and trees are soldiers. Qufu Zhougong Temple wrapped original copper cast gold people, the inscription on the back has 'many words of failure' sentence, quarring many words. In the movement of silence its commandment is no longer applicable, it is not a bogey, sometimes it can not speak, and the failure is only the truth. Therefore, it should be replaced with the word 'false words' square to reverse the actual right. \\nAfter the anti-right movement reached its climax, it is said that Chinese intellectuals have many bourgeoisie ideas, and some people wraps their bones against socialism, so they must face a headache. So the fight is like intellectuals only, including university students who will become intellectuals in the future. There is no movement within the scope of workers and peasants. Because workers are leaders, farmers are alliances, and soldiers are Miao Honggenzheng, none of them can have the right. Right against the ground, Jing Wei clear. \\nAt that time, Chinese intellectuals estimated at the time were about 5 million people, having been hats of the right, according to a book in the thin wave revealed that 'there were 550,000 people across the country, 400,000 more than estimated at the end of the Third Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee.' It is the value of ten draw one. Whatever their origin, as long as the right becomes the bourgeois right, because the rightists think is bourgeoisie. \\nBeijing and Shanghai are the birthplaces and frontlines of the fight against the right. The campaign began early and fought widely. I was more privileged to have been the first right-wing in Shanghai to be found out (known as a mistake after 1979), to become a headliner on the front page of the newspaper. The facts that followed proved that my right-wing experience was unique and bizarre among the 550,000 right in the country. Man without I have, only me. Why is it so? Speak long. \\nIn the spring of 1956, the Shanghai international trade industry achieved public-private partnership and entered the socialist society overnight. \\nBecause it is a joint venture, all the foreign relations of the original private import and export banks of the company have been centralized, leaving foreign agents from different countries to replace the original enterprises. A foreign customer in Shanghai has more than one object, a Shanghai company has more than one foreign relationship, and there are many duplications. Since the name of joint venture companies is not exposed to foreign countries, letters from European countries and Shanghai connoisseurs are still sent to the original enterprises, and then concentrate on processing after they arrive in Shanghai, so foreign officials can master the same offer sent by the same foreign manufacturer to Shanghai's original private management enterprises respectively for the same business, etc., and often find offers Different heights and shades of words indicate the degree of close business relationship with each other. Some disclosed information to good relationship connoisseurs, told Shanghai people competition, please pay more attention, and so on. Sometimes the same thing is said differently, revealing the operational secrets of international trade. These messages are in hand at the same time and look very interesting. Operate alone, glimpse of its secrets. \\nIn order not to let the other party know that Shanghai is already joint venture, foreign correspondence not only still use the original name of the company, but also use the original letter envelope, and then ask the original person in charge to sign. Issuance is only form, business without its hands, can make suggestions or comments at most. Xi Cheng's original English secretary is a Greek. Foreign letters can properly express my opinion, and at this time, he loses its original style. Fortunately, there is no business to get started with me. Occasionally customers visiting from abroad, they are still received by the original head, try to disguise. This way of business can be said to be an unprecedented innovation since international trade. \\nAt that time, the import of chemical and Western medicine was mainly English, French, German, Italian and other Western European countries, followed by Hong Kong and Macao. I was appointed as a foreign member specializing in this business, so I handle the largest number of communications, about half the total, the heaviest task and the busiest. I found the circumstances and hardships of conducting business under the leadership and control of the state company, I understand that all goods are operating exactly according to plan. It is no wonder that trying to import any of the items outside the program is a waste of telegram, in vain. I have done this futile effort in the past as well. \\nIn the international trade industry wrapped the phrase: foreign relations are food and clothing parents. Interindustry secrecy. To foreign clients, because they only rely on them to make a deal with them to sustain their own survival. \\nAfter the joint venture all openly, jointly external. As a foreigner, I still think that I should maintain good relations with foreign companies instead. For this reason, I often have opinions about the planned death practices, and are very unaccustomed. At this time, the company launched two activities, one is to rationalize proposals, the first is labor competition. \\nIt is difficult for me at any time to correct the problems of love's criticism and opinion, since the proposal to promote rationalization is right. Every see, write written comments to the company leaders, no less than twenty times. They said they all said they valued and appreciated, but none had been accepted. It was later understood that the way in which a market economy operated under many international practices ran counter to a self-planned economy, and was even seen as a manifestation of the struggle between capitalism and socialism. \\nAs for labor competition, I think who works with great energy, good results, everyone can see. It is the competition itself, why must go to engage in an unrealistic form of competition for the competition, and even create contradictions between colleagues, inevitably making 'evil' words, so that those who are keen to listen very uncomfortable. \\nHere I made a mistake of perceptions about developments and self-estimations, I thought I was doing a good job, and I was unaware of the view that the leaders of the squarely regarded me as discouraging. \\nAt the end of the quarter, the company selected advanced workers, one person in each group. At the foreign group meeting selection, team leader Wu Zhaohuang proposed 'I propose to select Kong lingpeng, please comment.' I listened to both concealed myself and very curious. I think it should be taken for granted to say about my work and results, why be bold. The result was unanimous agreement by the whole group and there was no objection. I do not expect that after reporting in my name, the leaders of the public will not agree, and must be reassessed. The main reason is that I am dissatisfied with the labor competition, usually 'strange words' (rationalization proposals), too many, do not meet the requirements of the competition. At this time, I woke up as a dream, I felt that active work was not OK, must cater to shouting well, obedience, and party consensual. The efficacy of words is far more practical. \\nAdvanced workers are simply fictitious and not affordable. However, it is an honour for the achievement of the work to be recognized. But in the minds of the squarely leadership, because of impurity of mind, 'wild' nature is not tamed enough to be the title. Then I said at an advanced group meeting: 'I am very grateful for your recommendation, although not approved, I am very grateful for your endorsement. I feel that no approval is more glorious than advanced.' This is no different and strange thing. \\nSince the labor competition, advanced workers have made public reviews, and those who are not allowed to do so are extremely rare. Maybe I am alone in this special encounter. In fact, this should be a warning knowledge education. Will I know that the truth is difficult to hear, and the nature is difficult to change! \\nSecond, the first speech forbidden play oboe\\nThe Shanghai Joint Venture holds political studies on a regular weekly basis, with private staff divided into ordinary and advanced classes. The advanced class studied the Soviet textbook 'Political Economics', and I attended the advanced class. At that time, deep inside really wanted to learn some new knowledge, to enrich yourself with a wide range of insights. \\nPrivate participants in advanced classes have a certain level and are discussed very carefully. Questions are often asked, such as why the value of goods produced at the same time is different, when working time is the only measure of value. Excavated cultural relics are valuable, how to embody it in the underground to add value to the labor hours, etc. The outcome of the discussion must always return to the law of supply and demand of capitalist values. Seeking to negate, difficult to solve. \\nLater, a private person from the field came to study, who reportedly had a very high level of learning and could take up the blame of arguing with me and refuting my blame. This makes me more interested in asking questions to ask him for answers. My thinking is more flexible, you come to me, often make him difficult to parry, can not avoid a complaint upward, and make me carry the name of reactionary thoughts. \\nIn 1956, Mao Zedong advocated 'flowers are laid out, hundreds of families fought', making people refreshing. The first words were forbidden, and people were heartened to believe that a new era of freedom of expression had since been entered. My mood is relaxed, for one. \\nOn the other day, Xu Fen, head of the Foreign Trade Private Learning Group, first approached me, saying that in order to implement the double hundred policy, the leadership was planning to hold a meeting in which all private personnel participated. I was asked to be the protagonist of the opposition and use the theories of the capitalist economy to justify capital exploitation, and asked him to be the main role of the party, and to rebutt my arguments.. Therefore, the two people must be right beforehand. Both have to be too-tat, but also wire into the buckle, performing like an oboe with tacit agreement, boiled down to recognition of capital exploitation. To rich a learning task, ensure a smooth completion. \\nAt first glance, a surprise. Hi is to find me in so many private parties, visible fame; astonished is not good singing, shades of shades, countless hearts. But if I come to the door, can it show weakness and accept it frankly. It is good to advocate a hundred contests, can say no bogus. \\nIn order to be prepared, I managed to borrow several books published before liberation, such as the Introduction to Economics, and from China to emphasize that capitalists focus on seeking profit, winning competition, and determining commodity prices by supply-demand relations. Xu Shizhang and I, a student of Wuhan University, usually very familiar, in the presence of Xu Renqiu, discussed the words, expressed my opinion, and provided rebuttal arguments, determined to play this play well. \\nThe venue is located in the Foreign Trade Hall. On the day of the meeting, all foreign trade and private personnel attended. There were also a number of public cadres and staff representatives related to learning. More than a thousand seats were missing. Everyone was extremely interested in the debate on this new matter. \\nHee Cheng is not noticed in the industry, I have not held any position in the trade association, nor do I go to meetings. Less contact with the industry, we don't know me. I am a good name for life, like prominence, with this opportunity to perform, seeking a breathtaking, confidence can be false as true into the role. \\nThe conference will take a turn of several people to talk about the experience, and finally, 'Is capital exploitative?' Debate. I first appeared, in order to suppress the momentum, create an atmosphere, to stop on stage, slightly sweeping, opening and saying, 'We used to have capital, so we were called capitalists. Now that our capital has been handed over, so we should no longer be capitalists, but entrepreneurs.' Entrepreneurs say three words a word. Causes the group active, thunder applause, enduring, to fully promote the enthusiasm of the audience. Because the term entrepreneur is fresh and vivid, no one before it dare to call capitalists an entrepreneur. This is very popular. If someone has already said, I'm not going to pick up and lose ideas here. \\nThen I gave a few examples where capital is not enough for capitalists to make money. They must also rely on opportunities, vision, courage, experience, knowledge, strategy, diligence, ability, etc. to succeed. Speeches are often interrupted by applause, and I know I am successful. \\nXu last played, he came up and said: 'Kong lingpeng gave me a difficult problem, my rebuttal power or insufficient, but the truth.' The purpose of the debate was to raise awareness of capital exploitation, which, owing to the identity and consciousness of the audience, was counterproductive and contrary to original expectations. \\nThis debate has made me famous among the private sector of foreign trade and nobody knows. Many people appreciate it, can't help but conceive themselves. Call for name, complacent. At that time, it was unsurprising that this was creating a latent crisis for the future development of fate. \\nThird, ordered to take the lead\\nIt was true that the fall of 1956 in mainland China felt a new atmosphere of ease, comfort and warmth than ever before. Perhaps due to the turn of the wind, the leadership's perception of me also improved. At the time of the official announcement of the appointment of the joint venture, I was arranged for the deputy head of the import group, although the position is low, it is not small. \\nSince at the beginning of the joint venture, the organization of work of all private personnel, from the head of the section to the deputy manager, was decided by the public and several leaders of the trade association in consultation. Xi Cheng original is five counter-compensation outstanding inverse production, can enter the joint venture has been the net open side of special care, any post naturally does not turn to me. Arrangements were initially made on a temporary nominal basis as a transition, and by the end of the year, the company was on track, and the personnel should be reappointed. I have no mind about this, because there are or not jobs do not affect salary income. I was named on the list at the time of the publication, as deputy leader. Invaluable is that all the personnel are still their old, by the general team newly promoted only me alone, can not but surprise me. The main thing is that this means that this is a negation of the previous decision not to approve me as an advanced worker. Of course, it was not possible to predict at that time that this minimal post would largely affect my destiny for decades to come. \\nOn the day the list was published, company manager Wu Furong asked me to talk. 'Your performance is excellent, we know your past experience, so consider the appointment of the promotion,' he said. I hope to be able to experience your trust in the future, different identities, to better work for the party.' It is not clear that it is a reminder to me to make less comments later, and should be as requested in my study: to be a party's tame tool. \\nAfter a long time in office, the seat was not warm. Chan Lai Chan (now Hong Kong), who was a private section chief, said to me: 'Now there is an opportunity to open the third phase of the political school for business and business. It is necessary to have the position of team leader or more to enter the city school, research down, you are most appropriate, so decided to recommend you to go.' The opportunity was difficult and agreed immediately, and since then embarked on the road of doom. \\nMunicipal political schools of business and commerce have opened two phases, the first phase is head figures Rong Yiren, Liu Jingji, etc.; the second phase is 303 important businessmen who protect customs clearance in 1952. The third is the group leader or above private personnel. The aim is to raise awareness and transform ideas. Since the beginning of 1957, the period of study is scheduled for two months. Private personnel in general participate in district schools. Above I said that the minimum positions affect the future fate, because if not promoted, do not enter the city school, although it is still inevitable to be on the right, but then the encounter will be very different. \\nThe third phase of Shanghai Business School (hereinafter referred to as the third phase), consists of a mixed group of various industries, I belong to the group, from different foreign trade joint ventures and private parties in the real estate industry. A dozen people per group, 6 hours a day, are used to listen to reports and discussions. Since the call to large, criticism to the party to help the wind, from the sea and the sky, talk without booming, the form of chic, peaceful atmosphere, very suitable for my taste. \\nBefore I entered the school, the two leaders in charge of personnel and study of the Bureau of Foreign Trade asked me once to talk to me, carefully asked me to actively take the lead after school, boldly, speak freely, do not worry about it. I say that it is difficult to do so. Of course this is polite, not true. And they pointed to the wall of the office 'speak without words. The speakers' innocence, hears their feet.' Sixteen characters said to me: 'This is our party policy, you are assured.' I realized that it was a glorious task for me to take the lead. \\nAfter entering school, the school leadership also asked me to talk to me, asking me to take the initiative and take the lead actively and vigorously and exert the atmosphere. And tell me that not arranging me as a team leader is to give me more time, less restraint, better. \\nThese two conversations are like two Swords of Shang Fang, since it is insulting the leadership trust, if not doing everything possible, will it not have a heavy duty. So I really did it 'speak without words.' There is, however, a principle that must be justified and factual. After a few statements, a reputation was built within the group, and the whole group of students expressed great appreciation to me and could really play a leading role. \\nWhen in the spring of 1957, the country set up a ringing climax, newspapers published successively Mao Zedong speeches at the national propaganda work conference; 'People's Daily' on April 10 entitled 'Continue to let go, implement the policy of a hundred families of flowers,' and the United Front War Department of the Central Committee called on outside the Party to issue more critical opinions and other articles. The article says: 'put, is to let everyone speak, so that people dare to talk, dare to criticize, dare to argue... still do not put enough, not put too much.' ; 'Extra-party discourse is not bad but good, well in these discussions, most of which are relevant.' 'Don't be afraid to make critical suggestions to our Communist Party people, let us stand alone and dare to pull the emperor down the horse.' So so, make people like mu spring wind, indulge in the great great comfort mood. At the same time, the newspaper reported breaking the ban, and repeatedly published statements by prominent democratic personalities such as Zhang Bojun, Zhang Naiji, Long Yun, and Chu'an, as well as news from around, to inspire and vibrate, liven up their thoughts, inspire enthusiasm, deeply feel liberated speech and joy. Do not want to pull the emperor down the horse, but only want to see the people of the country. What else is afraid of words? \\nAround May 20, the News Daily published a reckless speech by Shanghai municipal councillors, asking the Communist Party to break down the walls and ditches that isolate the masses. This statement resonated with the whole group, and the outcome of the discussion asked me to write a letter that was not responsive. I was itchy, I wrote a short article that night, sharp words, cut the time and cons, greatly appreciated by the whole group, ready to post the newspaper. But the team leader Zhang Xianlun refused to lead, the group pushed by me first sign. I think both dare to write why not sign, but also good name, no false rhetoric. Next door to a group of news, asking for the same sign. So both groups of participants signed, another group member Wu Yuxiang (president of Shanghai Tsinghua Alumni Association, member of NLD), and I sent to the News Daily, to the editor-in-chief journalist Lu Lu Lu (and then misdrawn the right), to request publication. \\nThe letter was published in the original version of the News Daily on May 25, entitled 'Three political school Kong lingpeng and other 29 people supported reckless speech'. Everyone was very pleased to celebrate the dinner and caused a sensation throughout the school. Submissions were subsequently replicated by other groups, which were not published. This letter also has some influence throughout the city. Readers have sent letters to support, more people express deep appreciation for the writing of the article. \\nSince then, I have a great reputation in the school. Many people have questions and asked me to explain and analyze them for advice. To this end, the school has set up a question study group, which I am headed to answer questions raised by each group of participants. Due to the uneven level of trainees, some questions are quite superficial and biased, and the answer must come out of my mouth, the listener may think it is my question, my heart is inevitable some grievances, fear of being mistaken for me to be so naive ignorance. \\nGood view is not often, the wind change, gradually into the dangerous road of doom. \\nFourth, the earliest right front page headlines\\nOn June 8, the People's Daily published 'Why Is This?' On June 10, published 'workers speak', a great breath, not small, read consternation, heart wrapped really a question mark, 'this is why?' \\nAfter all, the show has a little bit stupid. Isn't the working class vanguard wants people to speak? Isn't it that the word is 'not guilty of the word, the word is not guilty.' It was too late to see six standards for fragrant poison and grass in late June. However, it was also a speech by a person entitled 'Correct handling of internal contradictions within the people. Why did the oral message earlier be different from the published text, and why? In fact, it is no longer useful to think, and the powerful anti-right struggle blows the horn of mobilization. \\nPeople with vigilance have changed their mouth in due time, people mouth two skin, how to say can. And I have become a model in the eyes of all people, turn around, can not change nature, not put down the shelf, not want to damage the blunt reputation that has been established in order to say false words. I think anyway I have commanded to lead the sword and the unselfless leadership of the big duke, forgive nothing, so not only have no silence in the group, but still talk about it. It is difficult to understand the arguments of the double hundred approach. \\nThe three-phase school was originally scheduled to study for two months, and was postponed repeatedly in order to let go, until the newspaper changed his face before announcing its completion. Just a week before graduation, the school leaders asked me to write a book from Shanghai Business and Commerce to Taiwan Business and Commerce, which is ready to be sent to the radio station to broadcast to Taiwan. I pretend to pretend: 'I am in Shanghai business and business circles. It is difficult to write such an official article. It is better to be smart.' Actually intended to test. The answer is: 'We study it, it's not you. This letter is on behalf of the Shanghai business community, not you personally. Be sure to roll in the afternoon.' I just ate a cautious pill, and now I am fighting the right. Since I can write propaganda articles on behalf of Shanghai's business and business circles on Taiwan, I must not lose trust, the right does not seem to be my turn. \\nThe governor who has an accident. Perhaps it is 'good faith, then the people don't dare to have mercy.' 'Believe others.' And so that the words of Confucius penetrated my heart and made me naive. Shortly after writing an article on Taiwan, on the eve of completion, I came to wrap up a sudden atmosphere abnormal, everyone sat down, face iron plate, no matter who I speak, no one heed, do not look at me, do not answer. I deliberately sought Xie Jiyou, who expressed my most admiration at ordinary times, to speak. He only kept his eyes closed and had no expression. I said, 'I understand your mood, I just want to say that what I've never said is the truth, I have not deceived you, and I have not done anything I'm sorry about everyone. You do not speak, I come to accompany.' \\nHowever, they were instructed not to speak, and were instructed not to speak, but to say the same thing. I went to the group long ago, the team leader hint that everyone stood up and went out at the same time. Only I don't know how good it is. A few minutes later, someone called me to the auditorium, and it was already in the package. The participants, including representatives of other groups, came to the criticism of my group. Curiously, the focus should not be on words but on the relationship that Shanghai is criticizing the unhatched Great Right, and Peng Wenying, the leader of the China Democratic League, one of the five central right that has not been rectified since 1979. Peng and Wu Yuxiang are familiar with the group. Everyone knows I don't know this person. I don't know why at this time, including Wu Yuxiang, is lined up, like a puppet show, saying that I have close ties with Peng and lie about having no contact, deceiving everyone. It makes me feel nice and funny. I know they are playing puppet shows with someone. I just said, 'I don't know Peng Wenying. You know more than I understand.' And I said, 'You all know that I always speak the truth, and hope that you will speak the truth too.' The meeting took only about half an hour, and the representatives of the groups spoke, and each said, did not fight me, and it was over. \\nAfter the meeting, the study team leader Shi Jisheng came to my home to ask me advice and express sympathy. I was blameful and said, 'Today's meeting, everyone in our group is falsehoods, and only I speak the truth alone. Why is that?' He revealed to me that I could not graduate, and did not say that I would be the right. \\nThe following day, 29 July 1957, the three school days held a closing ceremony, announcing that I could not graduate because I was not able to study well and I had to make up classes. It is really this time, too, and for each other. I have a bottom in my heart, and it is not surprising. Think of not graduating without graduation, and does not understand what it means not to graduate. \\nA few days later, I read the newspaper on August 3, 1957. My name was on the headlines of the News Daily, and other newspapers also featured prominently in the title of 'right-wing'. I thought I was a regular newspaper figure before liberation. After liberation, I had to be praised by newspapers in the Five Counters' Movement, but never became the front page headline. Call for name, spare time and regret not its place. \\nWhat makes me feel even more regrettable and unfair is the reporting of my 'crimes', which, although only two examples have been cited, they are more intrusive than I think I say. What a man is caught in sin, and there is no word. \\nBefore this, newspapers from all over Beijing and Shanghai have shifted from encouragement to critical fallacy. Famous figures such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiji, and Qian Weichang, Fei Xiaotong, Zeng Zhaolun, Tao Dayong, Wu Jingchao, Huang Yao Mian, Shanghai Peng Wenying, Chen Renbing, Sun Dayu, Li Kangnian, etc., were all received. To criticize, they are all quasi-right who have not yet officially worn the right hat. And if I do not see any scriptures, I am not criticized, but have to grab the top, and put on the right-wing hat first, famously Shanghai, is not the same number. Among the 550,000 right-wing elements in the country, I was at the top of the list. \\nFive, the right is honored by rare cases\\nIn ancient times, China and abroad, the right was original. I am honored by the right, a rare and lonely case. \\nIn the spring of 1957, Shanghai international trade industry has completed the journey of the 'United Nations'. I was appointed vice leader of the Western medicine import group of the state-run China Import and Export Corporation (SINEC). At the end of Phase III, I would like to report back to the middle as an employee of the state company, to enter this new environment, wearing a right-wing hat. I don't know what fate awaits me. It was thought that it would be another criticism. \\nIf there was an unexpected incident, a small welcome meeting was held by the secretary and manager of the party committee of the company at the time of the report, welcome the company's private party personnel to learn to return. People are only three or four, I am for one. The official welcomed the private side to talk about feelings. I had to take the initiative to check, believing that I had not been able to graduate, and should strengthen my studies in the future, and the leaders of the public had neither made a statement nor criticized. \\nThe morning officially went to work, entered the office of the chemical medicine department, I had prepared"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": " a large desk for me, facing the window river, overlooking the Bund, overlooking the view, pleasant views. Across from me is Ma Siwu, the leader of the square-squaret. He is the brother of the violinist Masiton, who studied in France, married his wife, and died as a result of the Cultural Revolution. \\nAs soon as office hours arrive, the whole group held a study session, presided over by section chief Xu Yiqiu. First of all, I was very surprised by applauding. I was ashamed to speak immediately. Chief Xu said that it was a matter of thought and did not affect the administrative work, and urged me to work with peace of mind. Confidential letters and telegrams, etc. are read first by me. Looking around the dozen members were all the cadres that I commanded me to conduct business contacts overseas when I was in Xi Cheng. At that time, the company's survival authority was in their hands. How to deal with fate is from, now I actually become their team leader, I really didn't dream. Everyone is acquainted, but, in the past, the private private was led by the state, seriously when meeting. Unspoken laughing. Today, working with groups, work without distinction between public and private, and nominally public and private. \\nWhat's more, I just sat down and someone sent an offer to hire me as a member of the Business Improvement Committee on behalf of the company to attend the meeting that day. This would amount to being involved in improving state-run work as the right, and it was thought that it was prepared beforehand, and not canceled because I became the right. \\nWhile I have been publicly declared a right-wing element, I encapsulated cadres, including members of the Communist Party, in the state-owned company leadership group, breaking down confidential documents, participating in the implementation of the plan, accepting new appointments to commissioners, and so on. It sounds like it's incredible today, but this is my real experience, and I don't know who's similar or identical to me among the 550,000 right-wing elements. \\nIn fact, the reason why I suffered this special encounter was not alone in love. It was only premature to debut. Although the fight against the right in Shanghai was unveiled, it had not yet been officially unfolding. From the promotion of great Ming to the 'workers speaking' was a mutation, and anyone from the Foreign Trade Bureau to the Zhongjin company did not know how the right geek should treat. So only one remains old, according to the chapter, so that I have the privilege of being a rightist honor, there is nothing Occasionally national solitary cases. \\nSix, the manufacture of right-wing snake out of the hole\\nThe 550,000 right-wing elements throughout the country were deliberately manufactured, originally for trial samples, and then mass production. Hordes of snakes, led out of holes. \\nMost of the reasons that the right have become the right is due to 'wrong' words that have spoken one, a few or more. 'Wrong' is to say that at the wrong time, the wrong occasion, was induced by the error. 'Wrong' is relative to 'right'. 'Right' is the swallow yingge, parole learns tongue. Sadly, almost all 'wrong' words are exactly the truth that truly reflects the truth of history, the social truth, the truth of the speaker. \\nIn today's view, after the test of practice, history verifies, the vast majority of the 'wrong' words of that year are factual truths. Unfortunately, the data was destroyed, and it was difficult to collect. Otherwise, if the 'fallacy' on which the right-wing elements across the country were beaten as 'right', assembled, analyzed and discerned, it would surely become a giant of the era of unparalleled, all-encompassing and all-encompassing good policy of governance. \\nWhere do so many 'wrong' words come from? In general, friends meet, discuss comments and say, neither widely circulated nor written. However, after the anti-right struggle campaign was fully launched, departments, enterprises, business and medical and other units from the central to local levels are keen to make every effort to dig out the right. Because according to scientific arguments that people must follow, it is said that there are left, middle and right in places where there are people, so the fait people must have the right. If there is no right, will it not become a betrayal and mockery of great scientific arguments. The right is characterized by ideological rhetoric. Speeches reflect thoughts, capture speech is the first figure. \\nWhere do the remarks go to? It's easy. Earlier, it was not a call to exert and help the party to rectify the wind. Are you welcome to raise criticism? There are speeches when learning, there are meetings, and there is a record of statements. It is not difficult to find chapter excerpts, pulling braids, black paper and white words, the book is difficult to escape How to take out of context, Beijing's first example. In addition, the masses can also be mobilized to expose each other, in order to keep good care, he gu friendship morality. So in the form of a big print, you expose me, I expose you, sometimes I have me in you, I have you among me, you come to me, and you come to me. Those who knew the words, and were silent, were free from disaster; blessed were those who were able to climb up on the shoulders of others. \\nSpeech vested, screening analysis, highlight focus, catch the typical, to specify the character as the object, meet criticism, on the line, at this time the wrong words escalate to fallacy. So the creation of a right-wing usually goes through the process of affixing a big print and opening a critical meeting. Come from among the masses, and go to the masses. People who have been chosen as the focus are not put on the right hats. Because it was found from the crowd, it was called pulling out the right. \\nSince authoritative scientific findings also clearly state that the proportion of the right in the population should be five percent, so five percent of many units are the target of the plan, rounded up to five people and make up less. As a result, the right wing of unit A often overruns, unit B plan is insufficient, and the assessment appears to be mixed. The same sentence is not on the list of units A, in unit B can not take off. Whether or not those who say the same are the right, their fate depends not on their own ideological rhetoric, but on the completion of the production plan of the 'right' of the unit. By March 1958, there was another anti-right remedial lesson, adding tens of thousands of 'leaking the right'. \\nIt is said that some supervisors are defenseless, believing that the unit has no right, or refuses to report it, or admits that there is no 'right', which clearly contradicts the authority of the right in the crowd. Their superiors often beat these supervisors who do not know current affairs and do not believe in 'authoritative science' into the right. At this point, the fight against the right has achieved a decisive and great victory. No wonder Mao Zedong said afterwards: 'The triumph of the true socialist revolution, some believe that in 1956, I see it was actually 1957.' \\nAfter the right pulled out, reviewed the case and broke into the cold palace. They await them from the publication of the treatment in June 1958 to the misguided correction in 1979, 22 years of spiritual torture and hardship of life. \\nAs mentioned earlier, because my launch was long before the fight against the right was officially launched, so beforehand, no alarm, after the incident, came suddenly, and had to enjoy the honor. The course of opening a critical meeting (except for the symbolic one before the graduation of the three school), without having affixed a large print. It's extremely rare to experience so. I am also the right to be different, and in my life it is another encounter. \\nSeven, the right-wing fallacy is all-encompassing\\nWhat did I say 'wrong' words of 'right-wing fallacy' in Shanghai, the first right-wing front page headlines? \\nI spent six hours a day in May in three school days, with the remainder of my time devoted to discussions, except for occasional reports. My group of students 'smelly' pitched with each other, with me as the center, talk loudly, the north and south, really did 'speak without saying, endless.' So in the fight against the right, the same classmates were hit as 'right' half of them. I'm sorry, some of them were more or less affected by me. \\nUnless there is no fight against the right, I'm not for the right, who is for the right. Undoubted, well deserved. Dare to spit the truth, no regret. My 'fallacy' is all-encompassing, needles and cons, cut the key points. Regardless of the loss of information, you can only remember its approximate, remember its important ones. True or wrong, please comment on the reader. \\nIt is divided into five areas, which are summarized as follows:\\nanti-party\\n1. I said: 'It should be the Communist Party of China, not the Communist Party of China.' \\n2, I said: 'Chinese patriotic, Gudojia words. Humanity does not start today. So the people love the party because of patriotic, not because of the party.' \\n3, I said: 'Daming is like putting a whistle kite, put high, ringing. But the kite-flying line is manpower. Want to put, want to collect. \\n4, I said: 'People's thoughts are like spring grass, destruction inexhaustible, growing. Poem says: 'wildfires are not exhaustible, spring breeze blows and breeds Hoe is useless, why forbidden.' \\n5, I said: 'Now foreign trade is wrong, causing national losses. Private Manager shall be solely responsible. Because the official is responsible for leadership, do not understand the business situation is justifiable. Do you not understand, listen to your choice, see your defeat.' \\n6, I said, 'Come among the masses, go among the masses. But there are ditches between the parties and walls. Party overcrowds are out of reach, respectable and unbearable.' \\n7, I said: 'Previously speaking of the Communist Party meeting, the Kuomintang tax, now there are both. There are meetings that can be completed, no taxes paid.' \\nAnti-socialist\\n1, I said: 'Listen to Professor Zhou Yuanshui (authoritative theorist), report that socialism is not afraid of many people. With a population of 800 million, our country has reached 1.6 billion in a few years, with more strength and greater confidence in building socialism. However, he did not speak of how powerful, belly, the amount of rice is large, so many people, what to eat?' \\n2, I said: 'The report says: America's excess production, economic crisis, not more than a few years, will perish. They pour the remaining milk in the river wrap and not give the poor to drink. We are better than them, milk is not prolific, and the poor do not drink.' \\n3, I said: 'Several reports with one example, the American factory invented fluorescent lamp technology, hidden for many years, secretly not produced, in order to fear the impact of lamp sales. System decay, stifling progress. We produce goods for many years, no need to have this concern. For example, a sewing machine, thermos and other grandma met like seeing the dowry that year, there is no secret.' \\n4, I said: 'Capitalist market competition, unplanned, products forced to fight and win, pattern renovation. Workers are exploited, living in poverty, unable to afford good things, new things, and overproduction, often in crisis. We are a national chess, all products, people's life is excellent, clothing and food, only because of the diligent work, do not buy good things, new things. So there's no need to produce good things, new things.' \\n5, I said: 'Listen to the report, before the liberation of Henan customs, landlords have the right to the early night, tenants to marry the bride to be given priority by him. I'm a northerner and never knew the local owner was so good. Now well, Henan has wiped out landlords. Farmers are no longer afraid of the right to the first night, but they can't afford to marry daughter-in-law.' \\nAnti-Marxism\\n1, I said: 'All things in the world are constantly developing and progress, Marxism should be no exception. Marx has lived for a few years, must have more hereditary works, updated in 'Capital Theory'. If he resurrected today, he must complain about why anything is allowed to develop, only his mind does not allow development.' \\n2, I said: 'Marx looks at social development from Europe, five production methods are naturally true. Now affirmatively, the world is no exception, as is China. There were decent slaves in China, but there was no slaver-based production method. Before liberation, Chinese society was a semi-feudal semi-colonial society, but also a capitalist society?' \\n3, I said: 'Labor time is the only measure that determines the value of goods. Price fluctuates up and down around the value. Excavated cultural relics value of the city; production of the same commodity at the same time, due to quality and disadvantages; urban development of real estate value added, such as supply and demand reactionary, does not work, how does this reflect the only measure of this decisive value?' \\n4, I said: 'Capitalists brutally exploit workers, occupy residual value, capitalists are destitute, and the workers are poor and miserable, so the working class will rise up revolution, capitalism dig its own grave. Don't know if American workers are willing to go to China to take ownership, or are Chinese workers willing to go to the United States to be exploited?' \\nFansu\\nDuring the war of resistance, I saw the Soviet Union's volunteer air force in China to help war, with strict discipline, outstanding service and deep admiration. After the victory, the Soviet army's actions in the northeast led me to change my perception of the Soviet Union. After liberation, one side down, the Soviet Union became the elder brother, providing me with assistance called selfless, and in fact accounted for a lot of economic cheap. The country has suffered losses and thanks for the gift. Moving away the Tohoku machine left behind in Japan was described as a just act. On one occasion, on a train, I saw the Soviet Air Force board at a station in Shandong in the middle of the night, dispersing Chinese passengers who were already sleeping on the sleeper car, forcibly occupying the bunks and alcoholics. In that year, the US military did not seem to be overriding in China. Together with the excessive rendering of the rich and beautiful life of the people of the Soviet Union, the impractical extolation touting, led me to believe that the past of the past is a loss of national self-esteem. Big brother with his own behavior, no one's arrogant arrogance, has seen much, and is very dissenting. For this reason, anti-Soviet speeches are often made, so that the pro-Soviet people listened very uncomfortable. I dare not satisfied with this life, and I am called anti-Soviet experts. In fact, my anti-Soviet anti-Soviet, patriotic self-esteem, disgust comes from the negative reaction caused by excessive pro-Soviet. \\nSome examples of anti-Soviet fallacy are as follows:\\n1, I said: 'I often heard that today of the Soviet Union is our tomorrow, we see the Soviet Union today, hope we do not have tomorrow.' \\n2, I said, 'Any Chinese intellectuals with a conscience, followed by touting the big brother's incomparable affection. Before touting, it is better to ask your conscience.' \\n3, I said: 'Seeing the boss of the Soviet Union, I firmly believe that the man is the monkey change.' \\n4, I said: 'Soviet watch sales promotion guarantee the difference of no more than five minutes a day. It is best to be five minutes fast, the Chinese can wear the wrong time to change the meeting late.' \\n5. I often say a Soviet political joke, listening to foreign nationals from Shanghai. \\nThere is a hall wrapped in the Kmlin that hangs the portraits of every Russian inventor claimed by the Soviet Union as the world's cutting-edge scientific invention, detailing these are the first Russian inventors in the world to invent airplanes, radios, lights, telephones, cars, cannons, radium, atomic bombs, penicillin, etc., for people to visit appreciated. There is also a larger hall behind the hall, magnificent and unparalleled. At the end of the hall, a huge portrait is named Khrushchev, the world's greatest inventor, who first invented the foyer. \\n6. Another political joke that I often say is also listening to foreign nationals in Shanghai. \\nShanghai Belarus was ordered to return to China in batches, pending return to Belarus with suspicion. A Belarus secretly agreed when sending off to a friend, that if life was as good as propaganda after returning to the Sudan, it would return as a standing image; if life was not good, just follow a sitting image. A few months later, in Shanghai and Belarus received a photo from a friend as agreed: lying on the ground. \\n7, I said: 'The Soviet Union helped Mongolia to become independent, make China's map from big and small; help the Baltic three small countries to be integrated into the Soviet Union by independence, and small countries to become big countries.' \\n8, I said: 'The report says that Soviet workers live well, everyone has cars. It seems that American workers are wasted and cars are driving in the streets. Soviet workers knew saving, cars were kept at home, so they couldn't see each car on the road.' \\n9. I said, 'Without looking at the Soviet Union's aid to China, I don't understand what is selfless. They pushed their exports from China to the international market at lower prices than China, helping us reduce the hassle of self-selling, shipping and remittance.' \\n10, Beijing opened a Moscow restaurant, in addition to the name is completely authentic national goods. But the newspaper reported that the Russian dishes in Moscow restaurants are fine and delicious. The dish is wrapped in bright red tomatoes, turquoise cucumbers. I read a deep sense of meat and hemp, and I said, 'It must be a journalist who wrote it wrong. It should be turquoise tomatoes, bright red cucumbers'. \\n11, I said: 'The people of the Soviet Union are living well and rich, that is, forgot to ask China to export a group of red gangang tailors and make a few decent suits for them.' \\n12, I said: 'After liberation, Japan surrendered only because the Soviet Union declared war two days earlier, one shot defeated the Kanto army. 'The United States had long known that it would not have dropped atomic bombs to Japan before the Soviet declaration of war, killing so many people in white.' \\nOther\\n1. I said, 'Hu Feng nonsense that Chinese public opinion is all. There is no public opinion in our country. \\n2, I said: 'The West is fake democracy, elections and then move. We are true democracy, we do not choose.' \\n3, I said: 'The saying: 'become the king, defeat is Kou.' That is not the right thing. Like Li Zicheng failed to become the great hero of the glorified peasant uprising. Who dare to say he is Kou. He scored in Beijing, and the butt hasn't yet been seated and called Emperor Dashun If successful, it becomes a reactionary emperor. How lucky and failed, today as a farmer hero. I believe that if this great man chose himself, he would like the emperor of the day, not today's hero.' \\nEight, the negative faculty disadvantages\\nI worked as a leader in the private sector, as usual, and leisurely. In so many months, the wind changed dramatically. The Shanghai foreign trade system began a comprehensive fight against the right. At the beginning, when I learned routine, I also helped me with light rain and no pain. As soon as the study time passed, I still set up tasks to those official workers and approve documents. Soon, private personnel joined the political school again, this time limited to foreign trade system companies, and set up schools separately. Others went, did not shout me, so my heart was fluke, thought it had passed. \\nThis school started soon, one day I was informed to go to school tomorrow, stating that I asked me to account for the problems. Hong Kong Road was set up at the staircase and met old friend Li Chunyou (later killed himself). He saw no one around, secretly said to me, 'You want to fight you, watch out.' Upstairs know that the battlefield has been set up, the meeting was slightly late to inform me that it is easy to pre-set up and be ready. \\nGo into the venue, mighty. There is a radio station, a reporter, a colleague who is familiar, at the moment, face solemn, such as a big enemy. Fortunately, I've seen the market, knowing that good play will open, punished frankly. I think you want me to say, I will roll out the truth. You have all touted me and called good for my 'fallacy', and I can't afford anyone to listen to what I have said. Is true is false, is right and wrong. You measure judgment yourself. \\nAfter announcing it by me, I spoke freely and loud in front of the microphone. It is divided into categories and organized, not only what I have said, but also what I thought: the aim is that as long as there is no bias, we can fight for compassion. The vast majority of the same is the truth that everyone thought or did not think of it but dare to speak out. \\nA pre-arranged spokesman came up on a rotation, some people said: 'I was originally prepared to listen to Kong Jinpeng's serious review, who heard his one-hour big report.' Some people said: 'Kong lingpeng continues to put poison, we will not be fooled.' Some people said: 'We capitalists accept that the future of socialism transformation is infinite and bright. Socialist system is hundreds of times better than capitalism. Kong makes friends with the past, dissatisfied with the status quo, strong words and reactionary.' Some people say: 'According to your usual level, what makes this mistake is certain to have a different attempt.' Some people say: 'The happiness of current socialism has been unprecedented since ancient times. Kong Jinming is described as a dark piece, where the heart is.' And so on, it was acting like a short line of lines, with me as a faculty member, to launch a mobilization conference for the fight against the right. \\nI am prepared to accept criticism with sincerity and fear, listen to the high remarks, unfortunately the criticism is empty, and almost no one has made sufficiently substantive theories about my 'fallacy'. \\nNow that I have become the right, my task is only to be the opposite faculty and no longer focus. The purpose of learning is to brawl other key objects. Subsequent meeting of the General Assembly, criticism of the day. Big print is covered, much less than me. In the end, private managers Hu Jingshui, Gong Fusan, Liu Zhuoqing, Chief of Section Wu Yuxiang, Bei Dihua and Team Leader Wu Liede were identified for the first group. \\nAt the same time, the foreign trade system laid out other battlefields, and successively pulled out 273 right-wing elements. Some of them were tentatively named as the right at the End-Sport Congress due to insufficient planned quotas. \\nWhat's different is that, apart from that mobilization meeting at the beginning, I was no longer criticized at this school. Probably because the purpose of criticism is to determine the right, I have become the right, I can't have to approve it again, but to watch others lively as a spectator. \\nIt is worth mentioning that the news daily study column for two consecutive issues with the title of 'Marxism Vanguo Evergreen', with 'critical right-wing activist Kong lingpeng's reactionary fallacy' as a subtopic, a number of drafts. Their common argument is roughly: what eternal truth in the world if Marxism is to develop. \\nIt makes me proud that it has not been until recent years that Marxism has developed on the mainland that the prohibitions have emerged, about thirty years later than my 'fallacy'. \\nThe school ends, returns to the company, the situation changes greatly. Desk by big and small, change the place no longer window; no words of dismissal and work seems to be no, only still pending processing. \\nNine. Expulsion from re-education through labor\\nThe fundamental right of the human person is to live and live. I didn't know how to deal with so many right. I never thought that it would almost simultaneously deprive life, the right to live and to be human dignity. \\nIn late June 1958, it was learned that the handling of the right-wing elements had been announced by the Central Committee. It was divided into six, depending on the importance of the problem. First level is re-education through labour, dismissal from public office, first grade two is re-education through labour, retention of public office; second class is supervision of labor; third to fifth grades are salary reductions of varying degrees; Grade 6 is the lightest case only wearing a hat, and it will not be dealt with. \\nSelf-measure what kind of treatment is appropriate after the news. People always want to benefit. I thought I was ordered to shine before, after enjoying the special encounter, I was not too heavy to deal with me. Recall now, it is naive, really dreamlike. \\nJuly 1 processing announced that I was exempt from the top list, expelled from re-education through labour. So far, the right is known to be the right, and it originally dealt with so badly. The Chief of the Personnel Section immediately talked to me and informed me that tomorrow going to work in rural areas, wages would be cancelled, and that the Public Security Bureau would pay 15 yuan per month according to the re-education through labor treatment, there was no holiday, not allowed to return home, and to cancel the labor insurance treatment. This is a blue bolt, the price of responding to the call is like yeah! \\nSince July 2, I went to the Shanghai suburb Zhenru Yan Jia to work in rural areas, and was delegated to the cadres of the five national cotton factories. Fortunately, they are not part of the same system, they are still very good, and farmers are also more harmonious. From this day, we have worked for twenty-two years, and prepared hard, and made my bones. \\nThese 22 years were supposed to be the golden years on my path, and now it is a blessing to survive. Let's first briefly describe, as regards to the labor and cap upgrade, another detail section. \\nI work in the countryside first, then turn to the farm. In the autumn of 1959 there was a provision for cap-picking for the right elements who had been reformed. In that year and in 1960, a very small number of minor right-wing elements were picking caps, giving great encouragement to the other right, but it was disappointing that the capping only formally lifted the mental shackles and physical torture, living treatment remained unchanged. It was an illusion that the original pay could be restored. And also drag a tail, that is, after the hat is still wrapped in the hands of the masses, not honestly, and put on it again. \\nI may lose a hat-picking opportunity in 1960, because one day working away from my residence in August, I ignored the radio summoning four right-wing teams to return to talk, and I was one of them. In September, the rest of the three people were announced to pick up their caps, except I wanted to come for another reason. It may be a team wrap recommendation without being approved by the superior, but at least this is a good sign. Certainly, another year, in September 1961, I was announced when I worked in Changxing Island. It was early in many right-wing groups, and I was the first to be expelled from re-education through labour as I did. Discharge re-education through labour while picking the cap. \\nSince I was expelled from re-education through labour, in fact, has been out of the foreign trade system. Therefore, as a new temporary worker, the minimum wage of 44 yuan will be collected by the Foreign Trade Bureau after the caps are removed. They are not in preparation and are not entitled to labor insurance and other benefits. The most ridiculous thing is that at the time of quarterly awards, I have the right to a reviewer without being assessed. It was only in 1964 that the wage was not increased, but the workers were already entitled to treatment. This is yet another unique special treatment across the system. \\nI have so far sincerely thanked one or several people, who I did not know, but its decision saved my survival, even life. Because according to the re-education through labour regulations, the person who is subject to this treatment is to leave the unit and transferred to the public security department and transferred to a foreign re-education brigade for rehabilitation. Shanghai re-education personnel were sent to re-education through labour farms such as Qinghai, Gansu, Anhui, Zhejiang and Jiangsu to serve their sentences. With the exception of the Shanghai foreign trade system, I remained in Shanghai, and went to Qingpu, Zhenru, Changxing Island and other rural, farm and foreign trade cadres and five categories (landowners, rich farmers, counter-revolutionary, bad (molecules, right-wing elements), etc. The difference between me and others is that there is no holiday, between or allowing leave home, or one night or a day, shorter and less frequent than others. This is a gift to me, not the rest of the re-education workers. \\nReeducation through labour by right-wing elements differs from formal re-education through labour. There is no time limit set, and it is not known when. Persons expelled from public office have been removed from the unit, and the vast majority can neither return to their original unit nor to Shanghai, but can only arrange work at the original place of transformation. A few truths, pain for a lifetime. Wives are separated and their homes are broken dead. The fate of waiting for me should have been, and how fortunate I have to stay in Shanghai, at least occasionally see my wife and children. So I am grateful to somebody who made the decision to give me special treatment, otherwise not only without me today, maybe my life has long been lost. It is likely to have to do with my political conclusions when I left Zin, when it was not saying that no one would move me. \\nI picked up the hat in Changxing Island foreign trade farm, returned to Shanghai Jiangwan foreign trade farm pig, two years later to transfer the foreign trade box factory to manufacture cartons. In 1977 again in the Cultural Revolution, four people picked up and put on the hat of 'current anti-revolutionaries'. Less than half a year after the help of the four people was defeated, that is, the Central Project Team came to Shanghai to declare innocence. In May 1993, it was changed to complete rebellion. This is another unimaginable encounter, which is strange and unique, unbelievable. make a different statemen"},

Refurbished with different names, and only one goal-the whole person. \\nThe first is to give hearts to the Party, to everyone dig deep into the soul, put the words once said unhappy with the Party, have done something detrimental to the Party, and even buried untold opinions at the bottom of their hearts, all must pull out their heart and liver to the Party in order to show loyalty and frankness. The big print is full of curious. Self-violence privacy, mutual exposure is short. \\nThen in the foreign trade system wrapped up a 'anti-leak movement'. The reason is that in the past, private enterprises had close contacts with overseas customers in their business dealings, and the transmission of letters and telegrams, had to tell which state secrets were leaked during the contact process, and how much economic information had been transmitted, causing a number of major losses, which was called 'leak'. Not only self-account, but also expose each other. Can be affixed to large print newspapers, can write informants. 'Leakage' content is arbitrary. So that men are dismayed, and they are not in the midst, and their souls are scattered; \\nAt this time, I have become the right, no longer focus, but I can not fail to take part in it and show my attitude. For example, when bargaining with overseas customers, said others offer lower, are leak. \\nBecause any anti-right rhetoric involving 'laymen cannot lead the insider' must be widely criticized, because the wise judgment is that 'only laymen can lead the insider.' , Shanghai foreign trade practitioners, especially the original employees of private enterprises, are all suspected of leaking, and are mostly transferred to domestic trade as salesmen. For example: Wing On Company Miss Guo Wanying (Mrs. Wu Yuxiang), broke fruit; famous Mei sent friends bag young butterfly (now Hong Kong), broke cooking utensils. It is only a layman who can lead the insiders, so then redeploy domestic trade personnel to operate foreign trade, implement a set of self-employment, mainly with me. Opening only political accounts are not the first of the economic accounts, only for satisfying propaganda, not counting the loss of the state. \\nThose who are considered problematic in the anti-leak movement are in dire and miserable circumstances. For example: After the joint venture, a private official, under the leadership of the official, conducted business dealings with Mr. Chan Ka Keung's company under the authority of the official. In a small stationery transaction, a telegram 'not much inventory, want to buy quickly', which is a generic term for business promotion, is considered serious Leakage, arrest and jail, handcuffed for many days, absurd and absurd. \\nAfter the campaign, the cadres were decentralized around 1959, and five categories of molecules and capitalists all went to work in the countryside, mostly arranged on farms in the suburbs of Shanghai. I was also transferred from Yan Jialong Rural to Qingpu Freshwater Farm. After about two years, he returned to Shanghai. \\nThere will always be a moment of calm after heavy winds and rain, and capitalists across the country put forward a loud slogan 'listen, follow, go', namely, listen to Chairman Mao, walk with the Communist Party and take the socialist road. Peach cast, reported to Lee. In the middle level of the private sector, 'Immortal Club' activities were held, met to learn, talk about experience, promote the wind and rain, adhere to the 'three not', 'three no' that is, do not beat sticks, do not pull braids, do not wear a hat. That is, sticks, braids, hats are not without, just do not beat, do not pull, do not wear only. When a little devil, then do the immortal, natural Wei escape road, everyone Goethe. Sigh that I'm still a little devil. \\nUnfortunately, the immortal life, good condition is not always, then came to the four Qing movement, who is thought to have four unclear suspicions, surely want you to look good. Wang Guangmei was condemned for this. \\nHowever, this is just another heavy wind and rain after the wind and rain, the overall level is very small compared to the ensuing rainstorms. \\nOne, the family is endangered only Lai Xian wife\\nI usually do not have savings, but the previous positions, treatment is more generous, so always maintain although not luxury and affluent, but also can count a comfortable and stable life. Before the right was processed, there were no other recipients except for the 270-yuan salary. At that time, the price was low, at least not to worry about enough. Suddenly, expelled from re-education through labor, monthly cost of living for fifteen times, it was not enough for me to use alone, and my family life was lost. At that time, I thought that support for three or four years should be recoverable, who knew that it was a dream of normal. \\nMy wife, Manfuyu, presided over housework after she married me and did not work anymore. With one woman and two children, when I was working in rural areas, I was one year old. The eldest daughter was attending secondary school. How do I live? \\nAt that time, there was no greater sin than the right. He shall be condemned by heaven, that he speaks the truth and does not know Not only does no one think about how you live, but there are people who take advantage of fire, forcing you to not live. I was again subjected to unprecedented and arbitrary persecution. \\nIn ancient times, there are many people who have been punished for events. But even if the head is shot, the residency rights of the family will not be removed. Unseen in ancient times, I met alone. \\nI originally lived in a four-storey garden house in Fenyang Road, Shanghai. It was relocated to the 15th Shanghai Xincun in 2015. After the joint venture, the rental area was reduced, leaving only the first floor and a pavilion room on the second floor. I was not expected to work for a long time in my country, Xuhui District Real Estate Company (at that time had not established a real estate authority), sent people to her home to force my wife to move home within a week, on the grounds that I had no right to rent the original house because of crimes committed by the right, and had to allow people who contributed to the country to live. My wife alone, fight invalid, the company brought to see the relocation houses, all uninhabitable. Later, a female private person suggested, out of compassion, that if asked to retain the pavilion or could agree, after repeated pleading to the company, he was finally allowed to retain the booth, or to pity her mother and son, with special care. So who are those who contribute to the country? Originally, Ye, manager of Xuhui district real estate company, he rushed my house back to rent for his residence, so my house was confiscated earlier than eight years of the wind of 'Cultural Revolution' to move home. This kind of thing was rare in the country at that time. Shanghai was the only one. This manager Ye, who contributed to the country, was met again by me. My wife, under the coercion of bullying and severe orders, Gu's children had to ask for all. The suffering of his mental oppression and psychological torture is not a pen to describe. \\nThe real estate company does not take up my housing as a satisfaction, and keep me down the area of less than 11 square meters, under the kitchen, on the sun terrace, winter and summer hot, sunny pavilion rent, according to Shanghai's highest rent standards, increased by about three times. Such poor houses, such high rent, nationwide only my family. It is no wonder that when I filed a complaint with the Xuhui District Housing Authority 22 years later, its director (the manager Ye changed a better housing for the rest of the year after taking up my house), when I heard me about the rent hike in that year, did not believe that it had happened. When I enquired by telephone, I knew that there was something. \\nThere is a Chinese saying: eat people do not leave hair. My encounter is provable. The public servants of the people do not know that there is a conscience in the world. \\nOur family of five was in this pavilion asking for 22 years. Cold in winter, hot in summer. Only one single bed can be placed in the room. The second child has not slept until the age of 23. It should be conceivable. \\nI first take 15 yuan of living expenses, and then pay forty-four yuan. In 22 years, how did my family live? I can also say how my wife and children survived. It is clear that my income cannot support my family, and my wife is not working and is not allowed to work. So I say I lose not only the right to life, but also the right of my wife and children to live. \\nFamily life was a mutation for my wife, paying a heavy burden on her shoulders. In addition to maintaining a living and raising my children, I have to fear for my work abroad. She was not eligible to seek employment because she was a right-wing family member. It's easy to find a toy factory painted wooden dog eyes zero work, day and night rush work, monthly income of only 30 yuan. Later, private persons were not allowed to work, and she could not enter the production group because of her identity. Rare to go to the film factory as a temporary actor, call to go, once ternary. You can go up to three or four times a month. That was later suspended. Lone and weak women, why do they live? Only because I do not know the current affairs, and I am open to my views, few to trapped my wife and children in the end of the killing, and wandering away from the land, thinking of guilt, but powerless. \\nIn an interview with a reporter a few years ago, I was asked how to spend my life difficult, long years. My funny answer: 'Eat chicken first, then eat skin, and then eat hair.' Listeners puffled. \\nEat chicken (machine), refers to selling camera, typewriter, sewing machine, radio and other easy to change money and cheap various machines. \\nEat refers to selling my wife and my leather coat, leather gown, leather shoes, etc. At that time, things sold improper value, for example, my wife's silver fox long coat sold only more than 200 yuan, my water collar gold and silver fox coat sold only 118 yuan, buyers are mostly older brother, big sister and foreigners, pick this bargain. \\nEat hair means selling my wool suits, sweaters, blankets, etc. Suit pants can sell a few dollars more than a top. \\nThe sale is difficult to last. When the 'Cultural Revolution' was copied home, my home package was empty except for everyday clothing. Those 'chicken, skin, hair' are all eaten in the belly wrapped. \\nI was wrapped in my house as eldest brothers and sisters know me the most. They know that in any case I will not be unpatriotic. After I went to the country, the three sisters made wisdom and four sisters to save ten yuan and twenty yuan in their meager wages to receive them. Second sister lingren also sometimes send money. The matter was known by their unit, and it was not possible to draw the line with me, that is, they should not allow my family to survive. Fortunately, they explained that their brothers committed crimes, sister-in-law and nephew were innocent and could not be allowed to ignore their lives. It took a lot of courage to be able to withstand the pressure at that time. Under the threat of the struggle against the right, how many relatives of the right have been forced to draw their boundaries and cut off contacts in order to protect themselves. I was lucky! \\nIn the winter of 1962, the uncle in Brazil sent a postcard tentatively to his mother. The address still wrote to the 1st Qingdao Road, Qingdao. Fortunately, an old postman knew my new location, so not only with my uncle, but also with his eldest sister in the United States, severed ties for ten years. Letters must be forwarded through Hong Kong and can only be reported to each other as they are still alive. In my letter, my mother informed me of the difficulties of my life, the time and yet to find a fixed job at VOA, relying on the Encyclopedia of Merchandising Encyclopedia for modest profit, she knew that if I had to do so, my mother would not turn to her for help. So in my limited income, I got a hundred dollars a quarter. At that time, the renminbi was the most reliable currency system in the world, with a high exchange rate against the dollar, with only one yuan per dollar. I had the pleasure of breathing. Later she told me, knowing my difficulties, thought it was a slight subsidy, and never thought that she sent it was life-saving money. She said that it was impossible to understand why. I can't make it understand either. \\nThe situation of the 'Cultural Revolution' changed dramatically, the sisters in the country were shocked, and left only to make this help. My wife's strong will and proper arrangements have kept our family alive. She is based primarily on our strong feelings and belief in my innocence. Someone in this environment thought of death, and she thought of living. Because only she lives, children can live. She said, 'What should I do if I'm a little shake to make friends and children!' She survived the strong spirit of my children and I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to her. \\nOne two, the cultural revolution of all kinds of suspicion\\nThe essence of the Cultural Revolution is the cultural life of the Great Revolution. Ignorance can be created only if culture is eliminated. Foolish created God, and God made man with foolishness. When a man is pumped out of his soul and only knows blind obedience, he will follow God's will to do stupid things that they cannot do, unwilling or dare to do. \\nLife is born in the world, in addition to survival, food and clothing, but also free will, love of life, moral conduct, emotional convergence, etc., but the 'Cultural Revolution', these requirements have all been eliminated, destroyed culture and also destroyed civilization. There is a famous saying: 'Do you not fight for 800 million people?'. So the crowd is no longer divided into the left, middle and right as before, leaving only the whole person and the whole two. There must always be a fight against the right. The fight against the right has already put intellectuals into a chilling, crushing the army, and now we need to fight widely and expand the scope. Fighting people to find people, do not fight others will fight to themselves. So the whole person became a special learning experience. All cadres, workers, peasants, of course, those in power love the whole people, a mixed group of people fought a mixed battle. One night of the whole person can become the whole, the one who undergoes the whole, but it is difficult to become the whole person again. Some people appear to be neither whole nor complete. In fact, they have been mentally mentally and mentally immobilized, losing their soul-dominated. Can only be frightened around a commander, dare to pass slightly. For example, accidentally soiling or breaking a newspaper with treasure statues every day, it will incur an immeasurable disaster. People are people, sad and again miserable. \\nThe famous literary Xia Yan wrote a poem in the Cultural Revolution Prison, which can preach God. The poem says: 'Smell people need to be whole, and now all men. Someone can be whole, not whole adult. The whole freedom of him, the man is still me, and see the whole man, and the whole man.' \\nHowever, the whole person also has benefits. Some of the whole people have experienced themselves only after the people also have their own personal experience, and have established an ideological basis for the rehabilitation and rebellion after the Cultural Revolution. \\nI don't want to talk more about the Cultural Revolution here. Because there are a variety of monograph available for appreciation. Hopefully one day, Barkin's desire to build a museum for the cultural revolution, which has been completely negated, will be left behind and learn about the future. But I am both involved in the havoc, and I cannot but experience it in person, summarizing one or two. \\nIn the summer of 1996, when the 'Cultural Revolution' began, I had moved from a foreign trade farm to a foreign trade box factory. I changed pigs to cartons and returned to the city from the suburbs. Although the carton factory is only more than 200 people, the composition is very complex, slightly divided into four categories of people. First, five categories of elements added to the right; second, employees of foreign trade units that had problems in history entered the black book; third, the original small owners and their families, the latter were mostly middle-aged women with no culture; and four, the revolutionary masses. Since the number of the first three exceeds the latter, it is known as the Foreign Trade Bureau reform brigade, and because of the former two, also known as small Taiwan. Shanghai is afraid that units of this nature are the only one. \\n'Cultural Revolution' copied home, a wide range of objects. The young generals of the family face those so-called four old items and gold and silver jewellery that are not seen, eye-opening, quite interested. My family was copied behind, and they saw nothing but the three oversold vouchers, not as rich and colorful as other capitalists, knowing that my so-called capitalist has been squeeezed out of oil, so a special benefit. Only documents, letters, journals, data, etc. that can never be returned, and the only white gold wedding ring remains. As for the slightly better clothes come out stacked together, left me when left. The large print newspaper at the door was not posted on an exceptional basis, because it was a sign to attract a random copy of the house. For me, it was a civilized manoeuvre, which was very difficult. If my original 'chicken, skin, hair' was not sold, and my family had eaten them in the belly wrap. \\nUnit to plunge home civilization, manoeuvre home brutality. I live in Shanghai Xincun is a concentration of capitalist residences. A high school with many cadre children is nearby. They are addicted to their homes and work overtime day and night. Under their leadership, any unaware primary and secondary school student with a red guard armband can enter their homes to carry out 'revolutionary' operations of smashing and snatching. For a long time, these soldiers, who have been killed by the will of God, may enter the house at any time and do whatever they want, without evil. In the evening, home lights out to avoid its fronts. However, the array came to hit the big thrilling, night hard to sleep. For them, the real 'night is closed, the road does not take away'. Because they can knock at any time, there is no closed house; they do not need to go to the road to pick up their remains, they can pick up at home. Red guard slogan drank like a ghost crying wolf howling, creepy. The horror they created was far beyond the night graves, and men were suppressed without the courage to whistle. \\nRed guards are not satisfied with smashing and snatching, some of them mischief is even more heinous. For example: they are cooking at home when they come. Put soy sauce, salt, vinegar, pepper and so on all into the pot, forced people to eat. See cosmetics, paint, red and blue ink on women's face, said, 'You love beauty, make you more beautiful.' The day frame and mirror are all broken. Beating and punishing kneeling is just as easy as you want to laugh What they see, feel new and fun, take it and go. Some say they are lawless and not all right. This growing teenager, shaped as a demon, has a law in their minds. The law is revolt, and God is the will of God. \\nThe wind of smashing and snatching came from Beijing, first composed of a number of famous Red Guards Corps, compiled in accordance with their respective father and brother as the basis. Lao Zi Guan, son wearing silk cuffs, the second red cloth, wide and narrow are divided. Initiatives: 'Laozi hero good man, Lao Zi reactionary bastard'. However, once their old man was defeated, they also followed the fall of the 'good man' throne, became 'bastard', even the red cloth cuff could not be worn. \\nOn one occasion, the Red Guards of Tsinghua University killed Shanghai, smelled the name of Shanghai Xincun, took advantage of coming to Xincun on a Sunday to order all five categories of elements and capitalists to gather together. Sixty or 70 people stood up to listen to their heads. The voice of 'bastard' 'reactionary' went on to the ear, while shouting slogans., many people wearing the rest of the watch, all forced by several female soldiers Under. At that time, the unit broke home, generally left a watch worn with you, the red guard clearly robbed, unscrupulously. There was a female red guard holding up several watches that had just been seized and shouted: 'I'm rich!' It turns out that he (she), love the possessions of the bourgeois, by envy and repudiation, generating the psychology of the good, the way behind. \\nThere have been millions of horrific atrocities during the decade of the devastation. Any student, any worker, as long as his or her birth is not a black six class, can participate in the red guards, insurgents, and obtain the qualification of the whole fighter to beat people and even kill people. The so-called capitalists, reactionary academic authority, black five categories, capitalists, American and Jiang's agents are all named as objects of struggle and looting at will. \\nThese rebellious 'revolutionaries' have tried to satisfy their brutal desire by physically humiliating, physically torturing, spiritual persecution and distorting facts against the target. \\nPenalty way from wearing high cap, hanging cards, development to wear iron caps, hanging wooden signs, lead wire neck, jet bow. Standard rack type is to be beaten to the stage, bow 90 degrees, arms extension, neck hanging wooden cards, punching pedals, even more with brick iron instead of big cards, do not say old and weak, even if the body is unbearable. These ways of fighting, originated in Beijing, are all invented by the Red Guards. Thus, torture to death to disability to illness to the wounded. Of course, some of them are also at this time, and he was 'governed by his way', and many of the whole people also tasted the taste of being whole. \\nAccording to their own tabloid papers, some detail the record of his (her), fighting the whole man, absurd and shameless and brutal. Some people say that the heart of the female will be more than male soldiers, it is not a fiction. It is said that a woman of the door because of the honor of the Tiananmen Square, changed to Wu, is based on martial, every person dead on the belt nail a five-pointed star, frightened of its martial arts, disregard the same fangs. She is now, like an innumerable number of men and women who have no overseas ties with her ancestral generations, are living in capitalism and in the region much more than capitalists than capitalists. \\nAll of the above, I was not personally experienced, but there were several fatalities in my little carton factory, none of which came from the hands of female generals. According to a Lin's surname worker who was stigmatized as an American secret agent for taking a memorial image in the Yalu River Bridge in the background, said that when he was held in a private cell in the factory, the atrocities committed the most murderous, even with bamboo sticks, were carried out by several young women who usually see the communication calm. The main thing is a female workshop director. I learned afterwards that I was ranked second. Immediately after the forest, I was forbidden to kill too many people in private jail, and I was spared. \\nThe cruelty shown in the Cultural Revolution, hard and hard to book. However, to see Liu Shaoqi, He Long, Luo Ruiqing, Peng Dehuai, and other countries, but still unable to protect themselves in the tragic encounter, those who are far away from heaven, lucky enough to survive should be calm. \\nIt has been said that these atrocities were created as a result of the loss of humanity; others said that it was a venting of beast nature. I see these statements are not precise enough. Human beings must have humanity before they can be lost, and these inhumane acts themselves prove that there is no human nature in him. Slightly human, so. People are at least mindful. \\nWell, the beasts eat people. But beasts eat people or eat other animals just for self-defense or survival, which is their instinct. Not all beasts are brutal and brutal, some are more gentle and peaceful than people, even the lion butch wolf absolutely do not eat the same kind. So the behavior of those people eating people is not worthy of being called beast, and it does not matter to vent. \\nSo what are he (her)? I can't find a proper noun on the human dictionary. German fascism killed Narudo Jews, Europeans; Japanese imperialism killed so many Chinese, Asian, and human atrocities. But the Germans and the Japanese do not arbitrarily kill their compatriots. So those who carried out all the atrocities of humanity in a decade of havoc are neither human nor beast. At most, they can only be considered a living animal made by God, revealed their nature in the Cultural Revolution. Animals do not die always alive. \\nI am very thankful, I have never suffered in the 'Cultural Revolution'. So I write 'Cultural Revolution' experience, different, can not but say it is a rare miracle.\\nOne three, Mu en you encounter hidden killing machine\\nThe advantage of this package is that my experience in the 'Cultural Revolution' is indeed a miracle in relation to the various kinds of robbery suffered by others, compared with others. \\nWhat is odd? It is surprising that the experience of a special environment wrapped in a special environment is different, and it is surprising that 100 percent of things happen to others and not happened to me. As the focus of the Cultural Revolution hit the focus, without batter, not into the cattle shed, is surprising. Without experience in the Cultural Revolution, it may be difficult to understand. \\nForeign trade box factory is characterized by many people in question and more than the 'revolutionary masses', the factory wrapped in rebellion storm naturally will not be calm. Because the objects are scattered, they are all, initially did not touch me. Later, there was a widespread rackle throughout the country, from all over the city to find out what I had to know about others, and sometimes several times a day, as many as a hundred times. In addition to relatives and friends old, most of them were former subordinates in Tianjin food distribution office. Due to the lack of minimum common sense of the situation before liberation, it is often possible to compare with the past with current understanding or subjective speculation. It is impossible to create misunderstandings, resulting in false and false cases. I sometimes spend more time interpreting than the actual content. When I was the head of the deployment office, there were more than 300 people who belonged to the staff. Most of them were above all, mostly unaware of their names, let alone let me introduce their historical situation and political background one by one. For this, there is often senseless entanglement, and sometimes their ignorance is surprising. The most difficult question for them to understand is how I can appoint them without knowing their political background. For example, for a 'monitor' that I don't even remember my name, came out three times. 'Imprint' before liberation was the lowest position, and they thought that holding the big print would be my cronies. For example, in the past, my chief secretary and team heads had a chapter of my name, and they placed a stamp on my behalf for all documents that I did not need to read in person. Whenever I read the document I myself signed a 'friend' with the name chapter. So the famous chapter's document is proof of purpose that I never had. Prior to liberation, this was the general practice of organs, and the chief officer only signed and not stamped. And they think that the chapter of my name shall be read by my relatives, and if they do not understand it, it is not true. It is difficult for them to understand how many times they have spent their lips on this simple common sense question. \\nAttention due to my excessive number of outwards. Two heads of different villains have asked me to write historical accounts at the same time. Anyway, the information is ready, written too many times, then write another copy to them, unexpectedly but no reaction. Under the circumstances, people who were much lower than my position before liberation, such as those who had the sole suspicion of a major, had been considered a big tiger. Civilian office above will become the focus. And I'm on the third level, but no one touches, somehow. Perhaps at this time the villains are busy fighting, killing each other. However, they did not completely give up or relax the torturing and bullying of dictatorships, and the rivalry between different factions, seemed to be less powerful enough. I am thankful not being chosen, and perhaps capitalists are not in their minds as a preponderance. \\nQuite calmer to the spring of 1988, suddenly came out of a self-proclaimed king's single-man family name Chu, a young general who used capitalists to play with. Every day, these twenty capitalists concentrated on their lectures and whatsoever, whatsoever. Even slapped female capitalists, pulled their hair, assigning a high surname and a capitalist with Wu's name for their minions, providing data and rotating targets. When he sat in the court, the two men of Gao Wu separated on both sides, and worked for tiger and persecuted colleagues The persecuted capitalists hated them far more than the youngsters. When they saw their faces, they knew why Hades always had to stand on the side of a few little devil. \\nThe young general surnamed Chu, childish and shallow, modesty, disgusting words, abomination, live and disgraced monkey. To be sure, the surname is borrowed by the monkey self-protection, and the surname Wu is a fake monkey. Its means of pominous and ruthless, really difficult to describe. If he did not see what he did, it would be unclear what kind of wicked and villain would be in the world. For example, he waited to the factory door every morning waiting for the arrival of a young general surname Chu sent a note containing the name and 'crime' of a capitalist who should fight on that day. There is one time. He told a capitalist named Liu that the previous salary of more than 300 yuan was"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": " a delusional restoration. When he criticized Liu Jun admitted that he had a live-in thought. The young man had written his own large print newspaper review book and posted outside the door of his residence. Wu Wu went to visit a bike at night. See not posted. The following morning secret newspaper, Liu Jun was subjected to humiliation for several days, on the grounds that he refused to obey the orders of the teenager. And, as in the fight against a female capitalist, he was forced to bow, never. Wu whispered to the young general that she looked down on the young man. This was Chu's shameful taboo, smelling the woman capitalist slapped. She was fighting because Wu had told her that she bought a big cake at the food farm and brought two fritters to enjoy capitalist life. On the same day, he bought a one-dollar white cut lamb and put it in a superficial tattered bag. Seekers do not dare to report, fear revenge. And if a female capitalist with Feng's name had eight hour sentences in the review written to the young general, the short 'when' was easily misunderstood as 'will', the Ministry falsely wrote her eight young generals in order to deny that there was only one teenager, the female capitalist was immediately fought. Things like this are few days old. \\nI was not selected as a focus at first, after a high informant knew that I had been a senior post before liberation, so every day I looked to me in public to account with the problems. My experience is well known and unobscured. But then I was forced to tell me about the privacy of others and the relevant authorities ordered me to keep secret, and I had to inform that the head of the factory was usually the head of the Revolutionary Council Li, who was usually in front of the people, was stopped. In order to understand the situation of Chu's actions in the capitalist, Director Li invited me one day to talk in the toilet. Just in case anyone knows, is my protection. Behold, I just sat on their respective toilets, and I was not long ago, I saw a shadow outside the door. Director Li immediately showed me to stop my words and sued Wu to be outside. It turns out that he has noticed the abnormalities of Li I get into the toilet simultaneously. Only this end, a shift is visible. \\nThe two men of Gao Wu dig hollow minds, and the lack of morality and ugly actions that harm the people The shameless man, why about this. Their own people are more fierce than outsiders. These ugly acts are only trivial things in the Cultural Revolution. Man without virtue, commonplace. To see one side of the Cultural Revolution. Because the arbitrary rampant surname Chu, no one dare to take care of, the situation is more special and different from the general criticism that can be followed. Chu a frightening for months, his wind is broken, I do not know is bored, or ordered to converge. \\nA wave of square, another wave. At the end of 1998, I was shouted to attend a training course allegedly organized by the Foreign Trade Bureau at the carton factory. The so-called training, really to account. The host does not know where it came from. I was asked to talk to me on the day I came in, apparently being the focus in the class. However, during the training, study documents, confess problems, do not matter to criticize. I know that fried cold rice can not pass through, neither indefinitely, nor innocence. Only the past history, on the line, self-trapped in sin. But the moderator always said that I would avoid weight and not spit the truth. To be honest, at that time the spirit was very bitter, thought pressure was great, and they did not know what they were referring to, and even doubted that they had mastered false material. Not afraid of something can not be accounted for, just that nothing can not be accounted for. \\nIt is easy to boil up to finish, by a person who was introduced as Director Zhang to the class speech, first said the results, and then the problem. Suddenly, he said, 'The class has a reactionary mind, recalcitrant in the end. such as not repent again. No good end. This man is Kong lingpeng. He was stubborn and now taken back to the factory, expelled from work and ordered to account.' Then, I was escorted by a secretary of the Communist Youth League, whose name is Zhu. In fact, I returned by car with no words on the way. I am secretly worried that this return will come into the cattle shed, how to account, the bottom of my heart, waiting for me will be endless fighting, suffering from skin meat, there will no longer be freedom. Who knows to come to the factory, she made me return to the workshop without making any representations, which makes me unclear. Thought that the suffering goes one after another, I do not know Ihu. Unexpectedly, too many days, others criticized the connection, and I did not move. So far, I don't know what this is a trick. I feel that the main purpose of this training course is intended to give me moral deterrence, others are just watching. \\nShortly after returning to the factory, the box factory was also like the city, opened to the workers propaganda team, and I was announced to attend the 'Give Way Course'. The dismissal of the training courses is not mentioned further, and at this time designated as the target of focus. I just started telling history, I was stopped. Their heads said, 'We know your old books, and we don't have to say much. You have to account for the more important things that you don't dare to say, think others don't know. Get up another stove and confess thoroughly.' This is a matter of urgency, I really don't know what to tell people, ask for enlightenment. He said: 'Before liberation, not to say first, mainly to the post-liberation events, especially during the Cultural Revolution.' I remember the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, and my friends Xu Jiahan and Liu Haigao had a discussion about the contents of the street newspaper and the villain tabloid. I asked whether to refer to that. He said: 'It was not clear at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, who had no discussion. So you are counter-revolutionary, do you serve?' It seems that this is not what they want. What is it? \\nBoth after liberation, I had to write from the experience of Shanghai after liberation, hoping to meet my head, right on the upper number. Later, a team leader named Yang secretly sued me: 'Look, you really want to account, touch the direction. I suggest you don't write things first, no one who has ever had to do with you.' \\nWhen I heard it, it must be someone I know who has a problem, and I don't know. Maybe they were forced to confess, forced confessions to crawl into me. Although I am frankly, knowing not doing anything bad, because I do not know who, had to search for all the people who had to go in line up, even playing mahjong, playing bridge, doing business, and dancing banquets and other contact people, all remembered by a list of names, each one, floating on the surface, do not involve the facts, self-knowledge can not pass, just ask for guidance. I put hope on the head of Yang, waiting for him to reveal some information. \\nAt this point, strange things come again. One day, I missed notice, to the city stadium (formerly Shanghai back stadium, after the Luwan District Gymnasium), open the whole foreign trade system graceful conference. A look at the scene, no seats, great, not less than a thousand people. I wonder who's the turn of bad luck. First announced a few wide models, and shouted several recalcitrant elements to the center of the stadium to fight, as a typical from strict. Most of them are private acquaintances. I could not expect that finale play turned out to be me. \\nFirst, the host announced loudly: 'Box making factory known as small Taiwan, cattle ghosts and serpent gods concentrated transformation, some know repentance, some negative recalcitrant. Some of them have the most serious problems, the worst attitude, and so far refuse to talk about it. Hitumon is indeed a great sin. We have to put him down. Expose his ugly mouth.' Then a loud drink: 'Put Kong lingpeng on!' I was shocked by the fact that the two rebellists who had already been prepared behind, one arm and one arm, pulled to the central position of the sports field, and let them bow to the public. Fortunately, neither listed nor jet-style play. Criticism of such a major 'criminals' is rare on such a huge occasion. \\nAfter the establishment, only listened to the host: 'Kong lingpeng is serious, refuses to give account. Now pull it out to show the public, immediately take back to the factory and order to give it.' Strangely gathered more than 10,000 people, borrowed such a major venue, not let me this protagonist perform, neither expose nor criticize, only shouting in the masses: 'Down hole make friends!' In the slogan such as 'recalcitrant to death in the end', I was taken out of the factory, only ten minutes. After the appearance, several rebels escorted the truck back to the factory. I think this on the way into the cattle shed no doubt, no account, how to get. \\nIt was strange to say, because I did not know how good it was to return to the factory, but was told back to the workshop to share the problem. I said, 'Workshop wrap can not smoke, I write materials, get used to smoking.' Actually assigned to me an empty house, can smoke, drink tea, alone, unattended. I don't know if this is a quarantine censorship, I hear the bell from work and dare to leave. Long awaited, I had to go out and ask the factory leader, what should I do? Regrettably, he said, 'Go home from work of course.' God! And that's what the trick. \\nIn the Congress of the People, not listed, not listed, not battered, not isolated, and both to show the public, the short time is also very rare. I am afraid that the experience of the national cultural revolution is alone. There are many cultural revolutionaries in the world, there are so! \\nLet me go out of production, overwhelmed, do not understand why using such a big battle to pull me out, but ignore it. Listen to its nature. At this time, I really hope to meet and fight, and know from the masses's pressing questions what the key is, exactly what I want to give. But even the fight never had my share. This muffled hoist can hold you more difficult than beaten, even think if the first killed and set fire, at least something can be said, not so search for a dead intestine, guess, not touch the mind, really pain has been extremely painful. \\nTeam Leader Yang was a kind man wrapped by the Industrial Declaration Team. On one occasion he came to ask me what happened to me. I said I don't want to confess, just no account. He hinted, 'You write so many people who have interacted, all useless, and should grab the focus. You think about who your friends have nothing to talk to you, now there's a problem and have a close relationship with important people.' He cares for not doing anything. Again, I made Mauseton open and guess their purpose. Ask whether the said Liu Haigao. 'Think yourself, but you have to account for organizational relationships,' he said. I suddenly realized that they had taken such a big circle, and the purpose was here, I thought they had saved the straw. \\nLiu Haigao is the father of the famous pianist Liu Shikun, formerly the Tianjin capitalist, honestly proud, generous friends, and Marshal Ye Jianying was his children's family, and I know traffic for many years, good home. My wife and I used to go to his house for dinner, play bridges and watch TV. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, because he and the music celebrities had had time, he was helped by him to go to Yan'an, he was very early copied home by the Conservatory of Music, calling his family the music industry's Pei Dofi Club. One night, suddenly arrested for counter-revolutionary crime, the reason and whereabouts are unknown. Prior to that, his family had become a forbidden area, and no one dared to go, he often came to my house to talk about the situation, talk about bridges and street newspapers, etc. At that time, Liu Shikun was imprisoned. Only in the big print newspaper had a little knowledge of the news and were very concerned about each other It can be said that we are the only relatives and friends who have exchanged with each other after the Cultural Revolution. Prior to this, I had no historical, political, economic or other implications because I was only friends with him. He was arrested and unknown, and thought at least I had nothing to do with the public, although he had to mention it briefly in communicating with friends, he did not highlight it, so as not to give him more trouble. Although I thought that at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, we and others spoke about Mao Zedong, Lin Biao, Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao and others, but you know me. In the course of the communication, I thought about the matter, fear that he would be forced to do so after his arrest, so I tried to ask whether the so-called major issue referred to the discussion between me and my friends, but it was denied, as mentioned above, so I did not think again. \\nAt this point, it is clear, reminds me of two things I encountered in receiving outgoing staff. \\nFirst, Beijing came to know me about Ma Xiaosei. I don't know any of her little sister. After the point, the knowledge is Ye Jianying's daughter Ye Xiangzhen gave birth in Shanghai, introduced by my wife to become a nursing mother. She and I met her at most once or twice in Liu's family. Only know her baby in her arms, how can she know her origin, identity, political background, and even her situation in Ye Fu. I had to talk about my wife, Zhang Minjun, wife of Liu Haigao, who had gone to care for a few days before and after giving birth. It happened that someone Daima little sister was looking for a nursing mother's job. By the way, she did not know in advance. At that time, he didn't know about being a mother also worth cautious by Jingte, although it felt funny, did not think Meaning. \\nSecond, after Liu Haigao's arrest, the Red Guards of Beijing Tsinghua University came to Shanghai three times to talk to me about the relationship between Ye Shuai and Liu Haigao, to emphasize what he said, not to worry about what Ye Liu has done, said something, especially what state secrets have been talked about, what they talked about, what they discussed, and so on. To Ye Shuai called his name, with hostile words. I was neither present nor informed. I only knew that Ye Shuai had gone to Liu's family for a courtesy visit, and usually had little contact. Zhang Minjun went to Beijing to live in Ye's home, the situation is even more unknown. \\nThey asked repeatedly, hard and hard, and said that they knew everything between Liu and me, they would know the inner knowledge. I said we couldn't talk about this, I never saw Ye Shuai, Ye Shuai didn't know I had. Knowing without saying, I can't talk about it. Each conversation took a long time, it seems that they do not necessarily want to know the truth, but hope I'm forced to make a few words, I can meet the needs, I'm not loose, I have to go. \\nHaving had the above experience, they began to realize that they wanted Ye Shuai, the problem was serious, but it had nothing to do with me. I can only write from the knowledge of Liu Haigao, until he is arrested, and the content can only be limited to the facts of normal communication. Having been appointed to talk about the organization, I think of the so-called Pedofi Club, emphasizing that those people who used to think it was only in the music world, now realize that I always went to Liu's home. It should also be a member of a club organization. I think this can pass, who knows otherwise. \\nI was told to start touching the actual, but refutable, Pei Dofi Club wrapped without me, and I and Liu Haigao were another organization. And it means that organizations do not necessarily have a fixed form, as long as collusion and complicity in bad things are organizations. \\nI was stupid at this time, lest it was that Liu Haigao was forced to mess out in the wrapped surface, that he had only insisted. I do not know what he said, he said in chaos, is it not not on the two sides to find trouble? Fortunately, not a few days the team withdrew, I returned to the workshop to work again, and I did not ask Ye Liu anymore. \\nIn the autumn of 1959, the Qing team ended. Like other units of the foreign trade system, the whole factory capitalists and five categories of molecules announced that they went to Chongming Dongfeng farm work, and I was assigned to the capitalist group wrapped. After going to the farm, the foreign trade bureau announced that Laichong personnel have reviewed, each according to the current group characterization. In this way, I am still a capitalist, and the problem is over, and let down my heart for it. Who knows good play has not yet come on stage. \\nFourteen, return to the labor force again\\nAfter I went to Chongming Dongfeng Farm, I lived with other capitalists in our factory, studying together, working together, mainly serving as some light farm work, such as cotton, weeding, etc. Work is not heavy, life is hard, every two months can return to Shanghai for ten days. I thought that having passed the two marks of learning dismissal and the debut of the conference, had been frightened, the problem should be clear, but after a few days of peaceful years. Unexpectedly, the storm has risen again, this time actually came a tornado. \\nAfter going to the farm, the biggest benefit is that you can't see those who are striking, pretentious villains, but also quiet. I could not expect that in February 1991, the inventory five, 16 and one dozen three anti-movement was launched again. I have long lived in the sand field. I thought it had nothing to do with me. I was neither a five or 16, nor had I qualified as a counter-revolution, and did not mind much. Unexpectedly, the superior eye clothing import and export company sent a higher-level working group on the farm. Here again is endless criticism and accountability, more fierce than ever before. \\nThe so-called May 16 originally referred to the 'Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China' adopted by the CPC Central Committee on May 16, 1996, announcing the abolition of Peng Zhen and other groups of cultural revolutions, replacing them with the 'Central Cultural Revolution Group' headed by Chen Boda and Jiang Qing, claiming that 'a figure like Khrushchev, he They are sleeping next to us, and party committees at all levels must pay full attention to this.' Unveiled the prelude to 'sweep all the gods of cattle'. The following year, the 'Five Six Corps' student organization was established to oppose Zhou Enlai. The situation changed, the head changed, personnel changed, and the '5,16 Corps' was banned shortly after its establishment, the head was arrested and the group was disbanded. In 1971, the CPC Central Committee decided to launch a national inventory of the 5,16 movement. No one knows where there is a '5,16 anti-revolutionary corps' and who is the leader of the Corps. However, along with the inventory class team, the struggle from crime clearing to the Qing Organization was widely launched in all units across the country. Repeated, the bigger it is, forced to confess faith everywhere, a lot of the former cunning villains have now become five or 16 to stand frankly, tasted the taste of self-serving fruit. \\nThe team captain surname money, harsh and fierce, the whole person leaves no room, infinitely on the platform. The cattle shed has closed a lot of people, working overtime day and night to force confessions, hard hit several right-wing 'counter-revolutionary small groups'. At this time, all capitalists with my team were released from production, and unlike before, emphasized the words and deeds in the 'Cultural Revolution', especially 'non-proliferation', 'listening to enemy Taiwan' and 'wrapping foreign countries.' The so-called 'non-proliferation' mainly refers to criticism and discourse directed at the then central leaders such as Mao Zedong, Lin Biao, Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, and others, including the lack of slander and irony of people. Calling to account for the issue of the handing over of life, talked about the problem of shooting, and, of course, encouraged the disclosure of informants. \\nSomehow, the things that come across me are always unique and unique. On any occasion it is prominent and peculiar, contrasting. What surprised me this time, but also slightly comforted was that the evil money captain came to visit the capitalist's accounts, he was blatant to everyone. The only thing before me was with the color, and told me peace of mind, not to worry about it. People in the same group do not understand why I only get this special encounter. I thought it must be that my question had been reviewed clearly. \\nIn the process of communication, I don't know how many batter meetings have been opened, the main target is five categories of elements and individual capitalists, not only do not fight me, but also appointed me to speak and criticize others at the meeting. First give me some materials, on the line, empty out a talk, anyway is doing a play, who will not be true. \\nThe strange thing is that others go back to work and stop communicating, called liberation, and wait until I become the last person. It is still very gracious and peaceful to me, but I continue to talk, endless. In my life journey, I have done a few things, and I can't cross it over a hundred times. I can't pass through the customs only constantly on the line, and finally go online to self-check the sacrifices and suffering of PLA soldiers and civilians during the civil war in Pingjin before liberation., Hands stained with blood, because without me supplying the military food of the KMT troops, they could not fight, even though they were ordered to fight, liberate. The army and the ordinary people will not suffer. This is forced to be helpless, only to pass through the border, so felony, death is lost, what else dare to tell. Who knows this is still considered chicken garlic skin, avoid weight is light, with quantity instead of quality, refuse to touch the actual. Truly others do not dare to do so, knowing that fake electricity will get treasure, catch big fish, a few heads will also be cut off. In me otherwise, still not on the number. \\nI saw this way, after hinting and figuring, gradually realized that they were not interested in my history. What I wanted was 'non-proliferation' materials. I had talked to Xu Jiahan and Liu Haigao in the early days of the Cultural Revolution. I had already talked to Xu Jiahan and Liu Haigao, and asked to get 'who had no discussion at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. Therefore, you were judged to be a counter-revolution. Heart dress!' of the reply. However, this time, one time. The current focus on 'non-proliferation' is a new term that is never heard of before, perhaps for the defense of the mouths of the people to be better than the Chong Chuan. I only change the string and change the direction. However, turning over is just a few words about a number of phenomena that are not understandable, and it is roughly the same as Xu Liu said. It has to talk about the cause of engagement, there are previous causes and consequences, and explain in detail why there would be such discussions. All of the arguments are based on facts, not the wind of the hollow, and I have not spread out of your mouth. At this point, on the other hand, I was told that the material written must be sealed, and only be given to the team captain of money or to a female secretary with the name of Yao. Such discourse was widespread throughout the country at that time, and it was so cautious to my surprise. I know that while focusing on 'non-proliferation', others also have an account. Captain Qian said in his lecture: 'Some of the things you say are reactionary, very vicious. I can not but look at the work relationship, it is also a crime to read.' Fear of such a few words, nerve fragility as far as this is. Pity is again hated. \\nThen one day suddenly came to two people who called themselves to the Foreign Trade Bureau cadres, and said that after the tests of the various movements, I knew that I was quite serious about his attitude. This time is no exception. However, I used to confer on past history, and the Party has long been clear about this, so I asked me to give up new problems. I have given some information and should be added. Maybe it's a long time, unclear memory, out of trust in me, so the letter comes to check, hoping to help the party and the government figure out the problem. This thing really made me flattered, and I could not think of such a spring wind in the horrific waves. \\nWho knows, when they speak, I know the problem is not simple. Originally, they first put forward a few words criticizing Mao Zedong, Jiang Qing and other people, asking whom I had talked to. Their sharp poison is far more acute than our discussion, some of them are near abusive and sounded at heart. I hurried to argue nothing, denying having said something similar. \\nThey went on to say, 'This is the internal top-secret material we have, and we check with you out of trust. You are only allowed to listen, not to spread to others, otherwise bear your responsibility.' And after I promised, they added: 'Now that, now check the material you have, one by one, one by one, said it.' It is unheard of and eye-opening from the dozens of discourse they have revealed. Maybe this is what Captain Money said, 'I see and crime', and now I can hear it. Superficially trust, actually a trap. \\nAbout ten of the dozens of articles we have heard are words we have spoken or similar to them, such as Mao Zedong Killing a Hero; Jiang Qing Longkao, the whole people, disobedience; Jiang Qing history; and Lin Biao's traitor are equal. The discrepancies were rectified, along with an indication of the background and the origin of the discussion at the time. Some say yes, no say no. They asked me to write 'non-proliferation' material immediately, saying it was to help figure out the truth. \\nRecall afterwards, this is a means they cast my mind, cheating me with the materials that they have searched everywhere. And I didn't know what Liu Haigao had to say after losing his freedom. In order to liberate him, so I made it clear that there were no other words between Liu and me other than my account. If what he has given is different from me, it must be that he is not true under coercion, and the proof should be examined in detail. I promise to be honest and be fully responsible. They can really do nothing to achieve their ends, and deceiving scams do their utmost. \\nThe material goes on, and there is a new problem. Because I always speak in general terms about a certain issue, they asked me to tell you what I said clearly and vertically. It's hard to do, because you speak and I can't tell each other. And then had to be fabricated on the basis of fact, like the script, each with lines. But the main words are on me. This is because Liu is in prison and I have to trust, in a better position, and there is little problem. The main thing is to be afraid to write what he hasn't said, he can't be right in the wrap, causing additional trouble. \\nI do not believe that in the Cultural Revolution there are others who have been substituted for material by this technique, and indeed, in the advantages I received, I believe that I have been trusted. \\nAfter the holiday during the sports period, it is easy to boil to final liberation, but I don't expect others to return to Shanghai on holiday. This and my advantage contrasts too much, who is not clear. In addition to not being allowed to communicate with my family during the exercise, I did not return, caused a panic for my wife and children, four out to explore, who did not know the reason. Familiar capitalist just told her that I did not agree to treat each other differently in general. The ostensibly reason for my failure was that I was to stay in charge of supervising the five categories of molecules who stayed at the same time during the capitalist's vacation. sweeping, unpredictable. \\nIt took five months that I had to withdraw from Shanghai together with the brigade and still work in the box factory. It was not only a wind wave, but a prelude to a tornado. \\nFive, plus the crown advanced hat wear negative\\nI didn't know what farce in the world was shallower and boring before seeing Mao Zedong's popular nationwide report early or late. At that time, it was a matter of supreme supremacy and rain and rain. A different thing is the piety of fear in his (her), hearts. \\nThe box making factory on the side of the hospital sturned a huge portrait of 'Chairman Mao to Anyuan'. This is a symbol of authority, and the revolutionary masses cannot play basketball, because who accidentally fights a real image, immediately becomes the current counter-revolution. At that time, nothing in the world was more vulnerable than objects printed, painted or carved with Mao Zedong statues. People would be surprised by their vulnerability to their hands. \\nBox making factory personnel are huge. After the Qing team, more subjects are vetted than the revolutionary masses. Every day, this group is required to plead guilty before lunch before lunch, and so on to declare liberation before dining in the canteen. A few lines stand up into a piece, pedestrians on the road look inside the factory, see these people do not know if they are hostile, sympathetic, or as being fooled monkeys. \\nAlthough capitalists also have to ask for sin, it is an internal contradiction among the people. They can enjoy the privilege of washing dishes in the canteen. Each time two people eat in advance, this is a bad price, because I don't ask for sin and buy food in the morning. I also won this award, the day of shift can buy pot ribs and so on. \\nMy days after my return to the factory were not calm. There are often two foreign cadres who are not low to talk to me, or come to the factory, or come home, mainly to ask Ye Jianying and Liu Haigao's relationship. Sometimes I also asked what I know about the life and living life of the family of Liu Haigao, what I know about Liu Zhi's arrest, etc. I have to say that Liu's wife and daughter all believe that both his and her wife and daughter are arrested for reasons, may be implicated by Liu Shikun, hoping to know exactly, to solve their doubts, but they do not believe Liu is a counter-revolution. They said, 'By the time they will know.' Treat each other attitude, very and love. \\nAt the end of the year, the head s"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "uddenly came to the factory with a female court clerk to show me a piece of paper and asked me to copy. At first glance, I mentioned seven and eight sentences on Jiang Qing's origin in my confession, without a head and end, taking out of context. I immediately disagree, believing that all of my accounts had the background and reason for the conversation, not isolated from nothing, and that there were words in the discussion to both people, and that only a few separate sentences were not true. He said, 'You write the communication material too windy, should be simple and clear. It is the words you say, and in your confession, copy it.' I was forced to be helpless, and I had to copy it again according to its sample, and my heart was not taste. He said: 'Liu Haigao has been arrested, the court needs materials. You are doing the duty to help the government to understand the problem, and do not have to worry about it.' I know that this hand must be related to the Liu Haigao case, and not only cannot be explained slightly, but the evidence produced by the witness is actually copied from the original manuscript prepared by the Court. Witnesses are not allowed to add one word or change the word. Since ancient times, China and abroad have their own courts, such evidence can only appear in the 'Cultural Revolution.' \\nOn January 21, 1922, I was advised in the morning, went to the company to meet in the afternoon, do not have to wash dishes at noon. I haven't realized that this was a dangerous signal. Thinking afterwards, he is too little politically sensitive, because not letting dishes be washed out of the list of capitalists. \\nAfternoon ride to clothing import and export company, enter the venue, found that the atmosphere is different. Shanghai Public Prosecutions Law (public security, procuratorial, court joint name), personnel present, gaozheng platform, open leniency conference. I had no warning, I did not expect this to be open for me. After coming to the meeting, he also laughed with colleagues, and guess who suffers today. \\nIn the beginning, the company was treated as a prominent focus of a private person who was repeatedly criticized, and we thought it was a decision for him. Regrettably, the Public Prosecution Act declared him leniency. So, to whom is strict? My heart is dizzy, still trying to fluke. A few battered from the wide and nothing, I never criticized, and the advantages added, even the words of blame had not heard, should not be me. \\nWho knows doubts undecided, the news a break drink: 'Put Kong Ringpeng on!' I have not waited for me to turn to God. The two rebels who sat behind me in advance took one arm and pushed me to the stage, took my hat and made a solemn order. \\nAt this time, a head of a villain named Xue came to power to declare my guilt. There are four: 1, was the right; 2, former Kuomintang senior officer; 3, married by Kong Xiangxi; 4, learning often strange. By the way, the 'Cultural Revolution' and counter-revolutionaries carry out 'anti-proliferation' activities, but not the content. Ideas have always reacted, it is recommended to impose severe penalties. \\nThen, public prosecutors and law officials announced that my crimes were serious, my admire attitude was still good, given lenient treatment, put on the existing anti-revolutionary hat, and handed over the box factory to supervise the reform of the masses. At that time, wearing a cap and not holding it was considered wide. \\nI was horrified, I was squeezed out of the venue by about two people and took the car back. To see the factory inside and outside the door to hang out a number of giant banners such as 'down down the existing counter-revolutionist Kong lingpeng' 'Kong lingpeng must bow to confess guilt'. When I saw this situation, I thought this time really finished, must go into the cattle shed. I was asked to return to the workshop to work honestly after getting off. Those men and women workers wrapped in the workshop cast me with a different look, and there is no other indication. Since then, capitalists have become the current counter-revolution, from intra-people contradictions to contradictions against us. \\nThis is the third time I was escorted back to the factory, never into the cattle shed, without being criticized. I believe that the national 'reverse' has this strange encounter only me. \\nBoth of the four counts I have been accused of being 'counter-productive', are well known, none of which are related to the ongoing counter-revolution. Curiously, Liu Haigao was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment only one year after I wore a hat. The charges are also the current counter-revolution. He was arrested under the current counter-revolution, and after seven years of conviction, linked to earlier experiences, realized that both his and my convictions were due to Ye Jianying. He is Ye's family, and I have never had a side with Ye, and I had a black pot on my back, and would not be overshadowed, nor dreamed of a high-rise struggle, and pond fish suffered. \\nThe unease and suffering caused by wearing a hat to my wife and children can be imagined. Fortunately, my family and friends know that I was undiscriminated against. For a few years, the hoist finally broke. Whole my only purpose is to look for materials to knock down Ye handsome. Liu Haigao was both condemned for marriage of his children, and I was implicated by friends. His 'guilt evidence' is mainly the words 'attacking Jiang Qing' that I was forced to copy earlier. They worked hard to get these words and worked hard on me for four or five years of hard work. \\nAfter the Spring Festival at home wrapped in a bleak, haze and then went to Chongming Dongfeng Farm in February. This time, I went to five categories of molecules from various companies and box making factories, including several new anti-revolutionaries who were wearing caps. During the sentencing period was similar to me. It is said that the public prosecution law informed the foreign trade system, limited to the Spring Festival, wearing a cap quickly, and not waiting for it to expire. So it's time to hurry to wear a hat to the object, and it's not time to do so had to let someone go. \\nI know Jiang Qing as early as she was blue apple era, I couldn't think she and me had this fate. She plays films, looking for men, blows countless innocent people. Some people fear being defeated, others fear being revealed, they (land), are not afraid to sacrifice the destiny of the nation, nation, and people. After all, the myth is myth. With God, there is a blasphemy word. \\nSixteen, rain sunny to give me innocence\\nCome back to Chongming, the view is still, the identity is not. The team is all five categories of molecules, responsible for construction workers. After years, returned to Shanghai, still working in the box factory workshop. Fortunately around the families of small owners, they do not care for themselves and do not discriminate against me. Rebellion has passed, no longer often looking for people to fight, it is the same militia, from time to time, hung up armbands and assemble five categories of elements over the whole people's addiction. \\nAfter Ye Shuai's comeback in 1993, Liu Haigao was also released from prison for the liberation of Liu Shikun. He was sentenced for seven years, while he had been detained for almost seven years prior to his sentence. I heard my heart after the news, fantasies my problems can also be solved incidentally. It was easy to expect to come to the public prosecution law to talk to me, poured a pot of ice water on my head. He first asked me if Liu Haigao was released from prison. What is his thoughts about this. I thought it was an opportunity for me to plead, and anyone who knew was interrupted at the very first time. 'You do not have illusions about the early release of your co-offender, and you are responsible for your respective issues,' he said. He is early release is not innocent, you only honest and serious transformation will have a way out.' Finish. \\nA lot of people asked me about my situation during the July 74 movement, and others thought that my suffering was due to Confucian descendants. In fact, Confucian has nothing to do with or without attention. The approval of Lin's approval of Kong Lai is ferocious, and the whole factory is also full of so-called large critical newspapers, and only three or two are targeted at me, asking me what I feel about the reactionaries of my ancestors, there is nothing other than that. It may be that my factory culture is generally low, and I have fallen into the bottom of the human world. Yiyi big print is copied. Without me, the factory package will not copy my name. \\nIn life, I still earn 44 yuan a month, half to my wife's household, together with my sisters, but 670 yuan, she arranges family work, a cottage with a few clean windows, clean and clean. Wives and sons, the sun is relative, and melts together. I am even more difficult. In those years, the only thing that wraps for survival, no care for life. It is a blessing to have family reunion. \\nAs a reversal, I would like to submit a monthly report of insincerity to the CPC. Every month important foreign guests come to Shanghai, the Huaihai Middle Road, where I live in Shanghai Xincun, is the necessary way to enter the airport, hanging the bunting and clamping to welcome, and I was warned not to go out in order to prevent sabotage and disqualify the people. For example, Mao Zedong advocated not to live life, but on the day of birth, the national eat-life was celebrated, and I and the other five categories of molecules did not have the right to eat noodles in the cassette factory canteen. Instead, only our class 'sinners' followed Mao Zedong's intention not to make life for himself. Zhou Enlai died after the death of the box factory set up Lingtang, I wait for 'black five categories' ordered not to parry condolences. All this kind reminds people that Jiang Qing has exchanged for the soul of the truly patriotic people for his flesh of the flesh. \\nThe late 'Cultural Revolution' was noisy, knocked down, the destruction was destroyed, what humanity, morality, joy, love, love, etc. ceased to exist in life, but also fell emptiness and calm, people left only a physical shell. Only the treble horns from time to time come from time to time to day a model play that stimulates the nerves, oppresses the spirit, so that people know that ordeal and ugly persist, whether people have freedom or not, at least no freedom not to listen to the noise of the whipping ear drum. I am very humbled and happy, I eat a dime of pork or tofu every few days and drink an eight-penny bowl of beer. A more advanced point is to eat a corner of five bowl of plain red soup and seven pieces of pork chop in two corners as well as Western food, which is the highest enjoyment possible. One day is a day, I don't know what fate is waiting for me. \\nLin Biao collapsed in September 1973. The people who had been guilty of assaulting Lin Biao did not know a few. In my account, Lin Biao also discussed the same 'crime' as a face of rape. It was thought that the facts proved to be unmistakable, and this sin was exempt. His unanimous reply about Lin Biao's discussion until he approved Lin was that Lin Biao was rightly supported in the past, and it is right now to be criticized. He was wrong to argue about it as a leader of the country and should be guilty. He could not be revoked because he was now being criticized. This is the same as explaining the logic of the early release of Liu Haigao, it is correct to catch him, and to put him right. I have fantasies about his release is wrong. So my destiny cannot be controlled by myself. So what to expect? \\nExtremely counterproductive, Skynet recovery, I was finally alive until the 'four gang' was completely defeated a day. The fate of the nation, the nation, the people has changed, and I have begun a new life. Rain sunny, spring back to the earth, I died to pay off the innocence, and also took a step of old luck. \\nThe Cultural Revolution is known as a decade of havoc. The word 'holocaust' is far from summarizing the tragic disasters and losses suffered by the Chinese nation and the people of the whole country during that decade. According to official statistics, as many as 730,000 people were persecuted in the cases of Lin Biao and Jiang Qing, including more than 34,800 victims of torture. During the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Communist Party in December 1998, Ye Jianying mentioned in his speech that 'hundreds of millions of people, including implication, were victims of the Cultural Revolution, accounting for one ninth of the population.' Li Xiannian also said: 'Only national income is lost 500 billion yuan, more than 30 years of total national fixed assets.' This number should be correct. How fortunate I was one of the seventy-three. \\nOverall, I was lucky. Although demon wind and evil waves, can still survive so far. Book memories, an old age. Thinking can also be flat. \\nIn the experience, let it capture the shadow, impose on me, go to the end, out of context, confuse black and white, the end upside down, steal beam for column, wall fiction, unlimited Internet, a stick to death, etc., I have come over. Yuya! \\n17. Twenty-two years of labor\\nThe most precious years of life are in the golden period of experience, career progressively from 40 to 60 years old, but at this time I have been working or working on agricultural land for 22 years. Of course. There are thousands of such 'honors' nationwide. Labor is the most glorious, but my labor is in a humiliating environment. What I have done is quite a lot, but it is another experience in life. \\nWhat do I do? \\nGrowing Vegetables\\nIn the middle of the summer of 1958, due to the dismissal of re-education through labour, he was sent as Yan's family to work on vegetable cultivation, supervised by cadres of the National Cotton Five Factory. There are no holidays in principle, but monthly leave can be allowed to go home overnight, in which I have been a gift. My family looks forward to me as my family. First in rural areas, away from their wives and children, stigmatized and forced to work, their mood is known. \\nIn rural areas mainly cultivated vegetables, the first life of agriculture, the outsider. Hot sun exposure, severe winter frozen, must be Shimoda labor. However, it is not fun to see herself involved in planting greens grow and live. Experience the hard taste of the grain. Gradually skilled, becoming accustomed. The biggest benefit to me from farming is the duodenal ulcer, originally a number of times a year, must rely on special effects to maintain, after going to the countryside, never repeat, when due to the simple law of life, no longer work. \\nSoon to rural areas, the country erected three red flags, realize the commune of the people and call for great leap forward. Seeing the stoves of families and farmers were destroyed overnight, men, women and children went to the dining hall to eat, declare that they do not want money to eat, and realize communalization. Thousands of years of life have been overthrown and disrupted. No money for dinner is not equal to cooking, no money, where the money comes from. A national farce, farce for not a few days, dazzling, grass ends, families have to put up another stove. A head wants to control the belly of 800 million peasants, belly does not eat abalone, but also have to say that this head is really good. \\nGreat leap forward, bitter me. Social staff points, counting hours, more and more, always have income. In order to create a day equal to twenty years, night and night hot, alternating overtime. And I am a right-wing activist, working day day, overtime work at night, 30 days a month, without a day rest. Ice and snow, I and a small number of women members cut vegetables on the market, hand frozen hard to grasp the knife, the dirty and stiff, their painstaking imagination. However, the results of labor should be reaped, so called to grow melons, but it is really endless to wrap up ignorance and absurd on the day of the Great Leap Forward. It is only one or two of them. \\nIt was said earlier that man can make God, God can serve man. Not afraid of faith in God, fear of God. People believe or not God can still master themselves, and those who believe in God are not allowed to do not believe. For example, one day in April 1958, sparrow fought for food with people. Sparrow was the top of the four woes, and it must be rallied to destroy its genocidal class. So, the country ordered a day to stop production, some places are three days, everyone holding anything that can be ringing things such as basins, barrels, gong drums, pots, etc., group out of the outdoors, each keep the post, drive the sparrow. As soon as we fly, they cried frenzy knocking, not to stop It is said that it does not allow the stay to live and try to kill itself. I also glorified, shouting in the People's Park of Shanghai for a day. Summarize the experience afterwards, the big battle victory, extinguish its species, its survival, great results, wise decision-making. The performance is so strange, it is the world's most. Beijing is located in Kinki, and three days of bitter war, according to the cloud completely eliminated the sparrow. Statistics show that, on average, one sparrow was eliminated for every 25 people in Beijing for three days. One billion people, celebrate victory, the fool's whoever! In 1996, another sacred encyclical: 'Do not fight the sparrow, replace it with bed bugs. Sparrow is a natural enemy of tree pests. \\nGod is deeply cultivated, words: 'How bold are people, how productive the land is.' Great leap forward propaganda a mu of rice can produce millions of pounds, children reciting rice, reported photos as evidenced. And when God believes in this, what do men say? Ten thousand pounds, have added, so as to ensure the production of 100 thousand pounds of mu. God has God's law, asserting that one meter over earth, the standard of deep plowing. A word was made, the country rose up, I also experienced deep servitude. When digging earth, there are decentralized cadres holding a fine amount of one meter of wooden sticks in length to monitor. I dig deep soil until one meter depth, when cadres hold a rod measure, one more point is too deep, a little less is too shallow, just one meter square symbol scientific judgment. \\nIt must be regarded as a myth. This is not a myth, but the word of God. Believe in God, intersecting, deep-plowing dense planting leads to full pressure of cooked soil under full pressure, raw soil on rice seeds, and finally the particles are not harvested, naturally caused the next three years of 'natural' disaster. Doing so 'natural' will cause disaster. \\nI was rare to go home, the next summer suddenly got a nice difference. Every day pulled a yellow fish car alone to collect watermelon skin, rotten fruit, peel, etc., until Cao Jiadu, five kilometers away, pulled back for pig food. In my opinion this is a godsend opportunity, because not only can buy a bowl of ravioli or pot stickers, but also eat watermelon, the main thing is that Cao Jiadu and his wife pass a phone call, even invite her to Cao Jiadu to meet once. It is lamentable, its bitterness. Unfortunately, when the season is over, it is no longer coming. \\nMyth is more than one or two pieces. Three thousand years ago, China's smelting technology has been exquisite, from bronze to Feng steel must have a fire first. If ignorance goes to ignorance, no one will think of a small fire made of steel. However, in the Great Leap Forward era, some people made this wonder, set off the general boom of large steel making throughout the country, folk offer iron, collected everywhere, and put the brilliant finished steel products back into a pile of scrap iron. This is not a myth, but the word of God. People are not foolish, but believing in God is a great honor to join the big steel making. Not foolish, do not believe in its work, is the real stupid person. At a moment, the furnace, the fire bear, the whole Shanghai building and the original iron doors were all dismantled down, steelmaking went also. Man made God, and God created those who had to believe in God. The result is to turn usefulness into scrap, labor and people hurt their wealth, and the country suffers. In that year, Qin Shihuang harvested the civilian Tibetan iron chain into weapons to kill people, the alchemist to town evil, now the only function of scrap iron that has been refined is to move up and smash their feet. \\nIf I have anything else to do during my work, I was denied the right to participate in the big steel making, so that I did not have the opportunity to do a stupid thing that was unprecedented in the history of China and abroad in the past. It should be the most fortunate thing, because as a five-class molecule is not allowed to participate in the refinery in order to prevent destruction. Has there been a national loss of reason that is broader, more absurd, more lost, and more ignorant than big steel making? My failure to participate has made me worthy of the country. \\nBy heart, rural labor is under the supervision of cadres under the national cotton five factories. In addition to the position of female cadres of individual regiment cadres are firm, clearly defined, face unclear, human love, but have a lovely left, others treat me relatively mild, at best to maintain a certain distance, not to refuse people thousands of miles, so there is no spiritual too Great torture, flesh is also considered hard, hungry its body skin, Why am I wary of those who went far away from the north because of the right. \\nOpen tang clay\\nIn the autumn of 1959, he was instructed to redeploy to Qingpu County freshwater fish farm. In theory, although I was dismissed from public office, this time it was working together with cadres of the foreign trade system, five categories of elements, capitalists, etc. At that time, this was a special encounter, no longer exile the countryside and ignored it, at least indicating that the foreign trade system was not completely severed with me. I am deeply grateful for that so far. God is in heaven, and man in the world. Otherwise I could not have it today. \\nOpen pond labor is much harder than planting vegetables. The division of labor, the class is clearly defined. Capitalists cut soil, five categories of molecules pick up mud and delegate cadres whistle supervision. When I go, I can not mention, shoulder can not pick, gradually adapt, insist on exercise. My character has never been weak. Six months later, I have become a strong labor force. A large satellite was launched in the summer of 1960, calling for a fish pond one day to catch up with the moon and day and night. The difference between man and machine, just people want to leave a little time to eat, sleep, the rest have to work. About one hundred pounds to 1330 pounds for each burden of mud, I picked more than 300 burdens a day at most. It was a real myth to say that I have this skill before that. Man made God, and myths have a time to turn into reality. \\nOpen pond is very simple, in addition to pick mud, and sludge, from the water wrapped in the mud line to pass, throwing between the mud splashes, splashing clothes, everyone plays called (mud), uniform, let's cause, flawless washing. \\nI still have no holidays, others are called a small prayer, stay home overnight; one day in January, called the Great Prayer. It is the greatest hope and quick thing that I can be granted leave by accident. That year, the Spring Festival holiday seven days, I was given permission to go home for three days. There is no such treatment for correctional workers in general. \\nLabor, nowhere to take a bath, it can be known. Up to the river wrapped in a basin of water barely wiped. Later built a pool of dual-use bathrooms, it was actually a German government. \\nAfter the years of work in Qingpu, 2,300 fish ponds of size have been opened, since they put satellites, hurry, rough manufacturing, water leaks collapsed, and they could not be used. Its role was only in response to the great call for the Great Leap Forward, which resulted in a feat of turning the field into a waste pond. \\nIn the spring of 1961, Changxing Island foreign trade farm, also engaged in farming and feeding, the intensity is lower than the open pond. Farm breeding fruit beavers, urine dung drained into the river ditch, floating surface. We were instructed to fish in the water, deep in the water, the beaver dung stained, to be calmly. Do you not fear labor, manure, be afraid of dirty hands. The biggest blessing is that I can return to Shanghai, like others. The mind is not far from the beginning. \\nSure, it was September that I was also on the list of right-wing announced hats. I was not the only but one of the first of the right who was expelled from re-education through labour. After returning to the ranks of the people, my wife and children rejoice even more than me, because since then they can pick up their heads in front of men and not be humiliated. \\nPig Keeping\\nShortly after the cap was picked back to Shanghai, re-education through labor was lifted at the same time. In accordance with the regulations, I have been dismissed from public service, and after discharge from re-education through labour, work shall be arranged separately by the Labour Office. Most of the mentors who have been deported from the field are employed locally. No return to Shanghai. I'm a lucky man in this respect, and my life. \\nI was expelled from the Shanghai branch of China Import and Export Corporation. At this time, I was still accepted by Zhongjin, as a temporary non-staff worker, according to the minimum standard wage of 44 yuan, as mentioned above. The treatment was low to the limit, but had to thank it for the special care given to me. To be so, what to do more. \\nBecause I was outside, I could not work in the company, sent to a foreign trade farm near Jiangwan Guoquan Road as a breeder. After reporting, I know that my task is to keep eighty pigs alone. Eight heads and a row of ten columns, I was to lead these pig's light pole row long. Pig raised by small, raised to 1330 pounds meet the export specifications when the full row is sold, do not leave the stalk pig. Then, in turn, change the piggy. \\nI thought at first that one person raised pig 80, what could be done? Later I knew that the work was really easy. Pork food has special ingredients fried, big pigs fed twice daily, pig three times. Feeder can be used to feed between pig food, into the bucket into the food tank can be. I have experience in pick mud, do not use the car to pick, take its cool. Later there was a special feeding, relieving the burden. In addition to feeding, clean the pig ring once a day, with a leather tube rinse. Actual labor per day is only two or three hours. The pig sleeps, I rest. Let's take a look at the novel, it is also very comfortable. \\nMaybe the pig and I have a good breeding score. After the rest of the year, I recommend scientific pig, each pig in different positions in the left and right ears rolling the hole code, the number of feed formula and the growth process to make a record, ready for analysis and research, for the best results. I am accustomed to change, no matter what I do, to prove to people that I am born to be useful. \\nThe farm is away from the city and can return home twice a week, one night, one day, round trip for about three hours. Whether winter and summer, I am full of pig taste, home first outside the door to take off the coat, then inside, otherwise the room villain, a coat can make a full room pig stink. I also do not know when pig raising, whether it will become a lifelong occupation. On one occasion, Xinmin Evening News had an essay for 'I love this line'. I also wrote 'I love pig' application, the history of pig interest, not selected. \\nMechanism Paper Tray\\nIn the spring of 1963, I was transferred to a foreign trade box factory. Factory near sixteen shops in the city, can go home every day, ending six years of exile life. \\nThe carton factory produces export packaging cartons, the composition of which has been described in detail. I first and a mother, family workers and so on asked the nail paper box labeling prov, paste trademark, tie belt, sticky paper strip, rear adjustment mechanism workshop, machine touch line, feeding, stacking. Made after each bundle of four, practiced to hold up a dozen bundles stacked into boxes, walking freely, well done. \\nI am still outside the factory, every quarter according to the rules of the award, divided into one two or three grades. I can participate in the critic, but I am not entitled to be evaluated, seeing others take 20 to 40 yuan more bonus every season. Moms said that if I could be awarded, it was at least a second prize. \\nAlso during the pig raising, the chief and deputy captain negotiated that I had the same labor and had merit and could not be awarded the prize. It seemed unfair. I had not been evaluated. I was included in the second prize report, and the result was rebutted on the grounds that I was not included in the series and could not pay. It is expected that this sum of thirty yuan for me will not be available. \\nA year later, after my repeated application, I was transferred into the compilation, and the salary is still 44 yuan, but I can already enjoy medical reimbursement, participate in the award and so on. \\nBecause I have the dual status of capitalist and hat-picking right, all five categories of elements and capitalists in the Cultural Revolution will not pay wages, change their living expenses, and self-report the communique, stipulating that I am 18 yuan, 12 yuan for each dependent family, and the family will not be paid for work. According to this standard, I can get 54 yuan, exceeding my salary of 10 yuan, and the cost of living was originally to reduce the salary, and I was lower than the cost of living. I had to declare myself acquainted with his own initiative to give up the excess part and still take forty-four yuan. It is a single family, no other branch. \\nI used to resemble, suggesting that export cartons must pay attention to quality, label rolling nails should be neat, and damage should be eliminated should not be exported. It was criticized by the woman workshop director mentioned earlier. She publicly declared: 'Kong lingpeng is the right, do not forget capitalism. 'What you buy abroad is goods wrapped in cartons, not cartons bought. They say that they should not be exported, deliberately destroying the socialist country's wealth, and will not be wasted.' The outsiders leading the insiders, the sho"},

Packaging affected the price, and he (she), thought that exporting the handicap packaging was to reduce the country's losses and safeguard the national interest. Poor sighing. \\nI entered the factory in the spring of 1963, and left in spring 1979. After all kinds of sports including the Cultural Revolution, wearing an anti-hat at the factory, I then acquitted him. Except for two Chongming for a total of about four years, I had engaged in cass-making work for 12 years. \\nConstruction Masters\\nI went to Chongming Dongfeng Farm. The first time I still worked on farm work, and later turned into a small construction worker. \\nConstruction labourers, living heavy. Light is to the old master carrying mud bucket, bubble lime. Heavy is unloading, material, moving bricks, brokers, hand-mixed cement, etc. I am seen as a strong labor force, sending heavy work. Accommodation is dense and ventilated in summer, indoor ice in winter. Daily bottle of hot water without boiling, wash this. Mosquitoes, coated with soap water on the inside of the basin, welcome a pocket, full of black. Life is very hard, labor does not follow the timing. Working together are five categories of molecules, quality is uneven, and the level of culture is different. The openings 'I am the big old' also look down on the intellectuals, they work people, high people. \\nUnloading from the ship, the easiest to pick is red brick, yellow sand; the most difficult thing is stone, wood. The stone is difficult in the shovel, the wood weighs on the Unloading cement I can two people three packs, each pack of 100 pounds, walk the springboard such as leveling. Sometimes with square wood instead of springboard, only three or four inches wide, material on the truck, only three or four people have this skill, I'm one of them. This is the kung fu when the clay is open. Timber on board, thickness of varying length, take turns off the ship, no choice, two people a ride, to the person on the shoulder, self-master balance, shoulder to go. Take the springboard, such as lack of physical strength, is very dangerous, if necessary to throw wood into Hanoi to prevent falling water. Forty years old. My life is good, four bodies do not work, and this year more than 50 turned into a strong labor force. It is not thought that after twenty years, I will save my life by working on my bones. This is something later. \\nCement is also reactive, the cement, yellow sand, stone piled together, plus water constantly stirring, the more heavy, the force gradually does not support, later with a mixer, car feeding, easy many. \\nThe advantage of this kind of labor is a refreshing dry bag and can rest if there are no other tasks. Unloading one boat a day, just three or two hours. It's hard when the boat comes much more. The so-called rest, neither book to read nor leisure. Someone holds a red treasure book all day long and sit for hours without turning one page. I had to smoke in my hand, bitter years. \\nRegularly study, sit around the newspaper. Newspapers print treasure statues and supreme instructions every day, holding them in their hands and trembling, for fear of minor damage and a major disaster. Quarterly screening reviews are held to attack each other's criticism and expose picky. Fight others and protect yourself. Moral death is unpunished. Once someone caught the handle, there is no argument, no more robbery. Everyone is like floating water, want to catch a straw ashore. Actually, there is the whole man, and no salvation. Hongdong County wrapped no good people. \\nHe returned to Shanghai around the beginning of 1974 and was still working at the box making factory. In total, I worked in or after work or in agriculture for 22 years until I retired in March 1997.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Appendix II】Kong lingping: 'Insights on the division of the right in 1957' (October 2010)\\nAfter reading Mr. Song Yongyi's article published in the September 2009 issue of 'The Ugliness and Shame of China's Intellectual Elite: Anti-Right Instruction', Mr. Song always felt that Mr. Song had a very one-sided understanding of the 'right' that year. It is an unjust humiliation to the martyrs and fighters who are accustomed to this term, and who have sacrificed heroic resistance. \\nOriginally, the 'anti-right' movement was a political plot taken by Mao to prevent a similar situation in China when it fission in Eastern Europe after the 20th Congress of the Soviet Union. \\nThe Chinese Communist Party established by Mao established that there is no legal restraint under a one-party dictatorship. In the spring of 1957, in the absence of legal basis, Mao, in the 'Correctly Handling Problems of People's Internal Conflicts', thrown out six criteria for distinguishing flowers and herbs. These six articles were entirely necessary for Mao to maintain the Communist Party dictatorship of the Communist Party of China. Later, the movement became the main basis for fighting intellectuals According to. \\nBefore 11 this year, because Xie Chaoping was released, Beijing's 'old right' pushed a chorus to demand freedom of speech, and Xin Ziling generously made his remarks, so that I had a new basis for the delineation of the 'right', with a new basis, written for your reference:\\nAccording to reason, only a political party has the distinction between 'left' and 'right', and the 'right' should be divided within the CPC. However, the Communist Party of China (CPC), is a very poorly theoretical organization. To put it frankly, from its inception, the CCP has not been guided by any theory that could withstand the test of history, so since the founding of the CCP, it has been the principle of who forces will listen to. For the struggle to 'listen to whom'? The internal struggle never interrupts, known as 'route struggles.' \\nOverturning the history of the Communist Party of China, and knowing that it was a history of power competition, Mao Zedong became the leader of the party because he was good at conspiracy. After the construction of the Communist Party of China in 1949, Mao Zedong came to power. With his untold motives, the successive 'movement' launched successive 'movements' put in the horrors of constant struggle. The 'anti-right' of 1957 was a motionless attempt to clear the 'right' in the party and establish a dictatorship in his own power. \\nEveryone has seen from it that in order to differentiate the opposition of a 'people' among intellectuals, he extended the power struggle within the party to the whole society. Intellectuals were added to the four categories that had already been hit, when young students with no political inclination were the most victims of the struggle because of their birth. \\nThere are people who now justify this absurd extreme evil, open their eyes to blindness, and use 'enlarged' for hairs. \\nSo from the beginning, the 'right' has been divided into two categories, one is the cadres of the Communist Party of China (including the cadres of the Communist Youth League and the 'Democratic Party'); one is grass-roots cadres and young students who suffer from different family members because of their family composition. This category is almost entirely unaware of politics, let alone not attack the party with 'organized and purposeful'. That's why they are more grievous. \\nStudents who are totally ignorant are the most miserable victims of politics. At the beginning, they were pulled into the game, and quickly polarized with violence: some of the conscientious people naturally took on the political stage to resist brutality, and they sang a song of resistance in the 'overall route' disaster. \\nThey refuse to recognize that the dictatorship of China is their motherland. They have inherited the excellent quality of the Chinese nation's indomitable violence. They know 'democracy' in their struggle, and establish democracy is the only way out of China, and thus become the tomb diggers of dictatorship. Their names should be recorded together with Tan Chi and Qiu Jin Remembrance of the democratic revolution in China. The other part of the human nature succumbed to the twist of violence and turned into dogs. \\nIn the anti-right movement, they were a group of innocent youths who were not involved in the Chinese Communist Party rule at all. After Mao died, Mao carried out 'rebellion' to these innocent victims. However, Deng Xiaoping, who was loyal to Mao and came to power, refused to reward them, believing that it would be necessary to 'reverse the right', but only to expand to The world is pretending the past. \\nThis has proved that the CCP is already a fascist party that treats the ordinary people as splashing people, brutally and irresponsible. \\nLater, the facts led Mao Zedong to further discover that after his 'overall route' was defeated, the Party could not be relieved. Even if it was his close comrades designated as a successor, a large number of people pulled out of his office. In 1966, the 'Cultural Revolution' he launched in 1966, finally realized his lifelong ambitions, under the advice of a group of Nepentons. Ascend to the royal seat. \\nIn order to make the 'anti-right' true image in the world and completely repudiate the wronged people in that year, it is necessary to summarize them as follows:\\n(1), The entire anti-' right' is purely Mao's establishment of the authoritarian dictatorship of the Communist Party of China. 'Anti-right' is a shameless betrayal of democracy. The 'six criteria' he set out bring political and economic damage to the Chinese nation must be thoroughly liquidated. \\n(2), The 'right' originally refers to the division within the Communist Party. However, in order to expand the strike surface, he defined his origin as an important criterion for dividing the 'right' from the 'four categories' into 'five categories', imitating slavery society, and pushing knowledge into 'slaves' Tier, from now on, the Chinese ordinary people banned everyone, and the media banned it. \\n(3), Thus, the 'right' is basically divided into two categories, one 'Communist prototype,' which basically includes the Communist Youth League, and the lower ranks of the Democratic Party and the cultural intellectuals who have certain political opinions; they have innate ties with the CCP; the other is by family origin The main label 'social alternative', when they had little awareness of opposition to the Communist Party , is a group of pure innocent ignorance, the largest number of them. The grievances generated by these 'newborn calves' after understanding Mao Zedong's trick are very simple and resolute. \\n(4), Immediately after the right, Mao Zedong proposed the overall line of socialism is a blind toss that violates economic laws and contradicts public opinion. The first thing that came up against this disaster is precisely the 'newborn calves', who are most resolute in their resistance to the CCP. \\n(5), As for anti-human morals such as 'informing' and 'selling' in the right, this can only be attributed to Mao Zedong's destruction of social morals, the result of the insane distortion of human nature, the excellent traditional moral concept of 'courtesy and shame', has suffered unprecedented ravages and lost constraints on human beings. \\n(6), But precisely as a result of this, there is an inverse against the original worship idols, and there appears to be a rebellion that would rather be true and dare to dare to oppose the oppressive Communist Party. This is why Lin Zhao and Chen Li can fight with authoritarian systems. This is the great spirit of the Chinese nation, and it is worthy of the 'bloodshed' song, these heroes Together with Tan Si, Qiu Jin should be recorded in the history of the Chinese nation. \\nYesterday, the list of right-wing five or seven, collected by Mr. Wuyisan for many years, was once again published to the world. \\nI think that today, when Liu Xiaobo, the main drafter of the 08 Charter, was awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, announcing the list of victims of the 'anti-right movement' 53 years ago, has the following significance:\\nFirst of all the world's righteous people: the Chinese Communist Party dictatorship has entered the bone marrow. The slogan of democracy is like a hungry wolf to see food, immediately to swallow it afterwards, starting with the construction of the CPC government, all the remarks made by Mao Zedong, all the movements he launched, all the politics promulgated, all the covenants signed, none. There is no purpose to slaughter democracy. \\nThe 'anti-right' of 53 years ago brought millions of intellectuals to the unspeakable sea, so that dictators dare to use the absurd 'total route' that ordinary people can understand, wrecklessly ravaging the Chinese land, and its destruction is the end of the Chinese nation. \\nMr. Wu, restricted by the blockade of the CCP, is only the tip of the iceberg, but it has provided a precedent for future excavators. People have seen from this list 'masquerade' too poison, disguised mao 'liberation of the people', 'anti-imperialist' and 'serve the people' Tear a hiba rotten. \\nThe publication of the directory would help victims and their relatives to escape the shadow of repression and to put into the current torrent of burial dictatorship. \\nAs long as they do not give up a one-party dictatorship, Mao Zedong's zombies, change tactics, there will be no prosperity in mainland China, and there will be no rise. Now, corruption, official and public officials, collusion, polarization, and moral loss will increasingly intensify. It is also important to see that a few real estate firms are colluding with the official government, wanton encroachment of cultivated fields, random manufacture of poison food, abuse of 'development' and so on are still frantically destroying my China's great good rivers and mountains, encroaching on my Chinese body. It was not sensational before China's death. \\nToday, for the victims of that year, calls for the broadest possible coalition of all those who have been maimed by the CCP to form the broadest united front and continue to fight against the dictatorship of the Communist Party in order to break down the last barrier of the CCP's maintenance as a defense line and achieve minimum social equity. \\nShengyi [Kong lingping]\\nOctober 2010\\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached 3] Wuyi III: 'Kong lingping and his Giant Book Trilogy of Blood' (October 10, 2009)\\nMr. Kong lingping, a right-wing activist in Chongqing, died on the morning of October 9, 2013, a friend from Chongqing told me. Suddenly seeing this email, can't help but shed tears. My friend said: 'Although he was anxious, he also offended a lot of people, but he has been fighting against the authorities. Right wing like him is not much at present, and China has less one fighter. I will go to his house tomorrow and send him off.' We are all very sad about the death of Kong lingping. \\nYes, Mr. Li Changyu, a right-wing activist in Shandong Province, just left a few days ago. Mr. Kong lingping is the second place I know recently. It's sad because we've been 'meeting' on the web for many years. Now he's gone and never have a chance to see him again. \\nHe was indeed a brave right-wing, and he was constantly criticizing Mao Zedong, criticizing the authorities and insisting on defending his rights. Of course, all right-wing elements have quirky temper, and he also has. He gave me two books, 'Blood Trilogy,' 'A Soul of Suffering-My Mother Fang Jianzhi,' We have criticized him on the Diaoyu Islands issue, and I didn't have any more to go to Ann on some of his son's issues. Comfort him-I should say 'I'm sorry.' \\nDue to financial problems, I only published My Mother Fang Jianzhi, because the sale was very bad, there was no way to publish the Blood Trilogy, so I had to introduce friends everywhere to him, hoping to complete his wish-to leave the history of suffering to future generations. The results attracted the attention of Taiweng Information Technology Co., Ltd., and successfully published the 'Blood Trilogy' in 2012. \\nMr. Kong lingping was born in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province in 1937; he was beaten as a right-wing element while studying in the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing at Chongqing University in 1957. Because of the anti-Japanese war, he came to Chongqing from childhood with his father (Kong Xiangjia)'s mother's family. \\nIn 1949, the father decided to leave the mainland to Taiwan, but was unable to do so because of his mother's opposition. The mother thinks she and her same window and teacher had participated in anti-Japanese activities in Chongqing. Most of these same windows went to Yan'an and have become cadres at all levels on which the CCP relies, she can find a quiet life again after the CCP occupies the country. A loss of thousands of ancient hates, this home-like the home of tens of millions of Chinese people, has since fallen into a desperate situation where people are dead, wives separated, survived and unable to survive. The father, who had no guilt, was arrested in 1951 in the repression of the counter-revolutionary movement. \\nIn 1948, he was nominated by Gu Yuxiu as president of the Chongqing Branch of Central Chengchi University, a book student. Arrested in 1951 in the repression of the counter-revolutionary movement, and in 1956, an educator who had no fault was destroyed. Although the death of the father was not told until 30 years later, after repeated questioning, it did not prevent his mother and son from being persecuted as 'counter-revolutionary family'. \\nFong Jianzhi, the mother of the Chinese Communist Party of Unity War and 'ally', founded Jialing High School in 1941. A teacher who has an infinite love for education and students, even the humble dream of 'having a bite to eat' has dashed. At the age of 33, he became a 'widow' and 'counter-revolutionary family', living in nightmares and misery since then. \\nIn 1957, Kong lingping, who was studying at Chongqing University, fell together with his mother into Mao Zedong's imperial conspiracy trap, all beaten as right-wing elements. Induced by the leadership, Fang Jianzhi, euphemism, twists and carefully raised questions about Kong Xiangjia's arrest and unclear whereabouts to the 'Party Organization'. He was classified as a right-wing element and sent to 'supervise labor inspection', with a living cost of only 22 yuan a month, carrying an old mother over seventy years, with a young son of only 13 years old.. Kong lingping, who studied at Chongqing University, was charged with 'taking advantage of the party's reckoning and plotting together with his mother to rectify the case for the counterrevolutionary father.' Kong lingping's mother and son committed a series of crimes. \\nIn 1960, Kong lingping was arrested and sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment and sent to re-education through labour. In 1961, Kong lingping's grandmother died of starvation and misery of his grandson; after that, the mother and brother were sent to a rural hospital for rehabilitation, humiliated, tortured and even beaten. \\nDuring the ten years of the havoc, Kong lingping was declared the death penalty (not approved), and increased to 20 years for calling 'down Mao Zedong'. In 1967, his brother, only 23 years old, was shot dead for no reason, and the mother wanted to give birth and attempted suicide. \\nIn 1979, although Kong lingping was 'rehabilitated', his salary for 20 years in prison has not been repaid. In 1999, the mother died. Kong lingping has become a single family. \\nThe following is the experience of Kong lingping's 'labor transformation'. \\n1955 graduated from the 13th middle school in Chongqing, and entered the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing of Chongqing University. \\nIn November 1957 was classified as a right-wing element (because of his father's 'Shulian'), in May of the same year was escorted by the school to the bush coal mine in Nantong mining area, in January 1960 was arrested by Nantong Public Security Bureau, sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment by Nantong Court in August of the same year, and in September 1960 to Chongqing Second Prison (Sun Garden), 'Labour reform'. \\n\\tExiled to Ganluo Yi Autonomous County of Sichuan Province in March 1962, exile 969 mail box 'labor' in Yanyuan County, Xichang in February 1963. In June of the same year, he went to the farm Gubai branch 'labor', and conducted the first four-day hunger strike in July to protest. \\nIn August 1963, he went to the second ditch section for a year of confinement for reflection. In September 1964, the prison was released for a second 10-day hunger strike. \\nIn March 1966, the sixth squadron of Yanyuan Farm was detained and called to Chengdu to visit the photographic exhibition of Agricultural Science Dazhai. In June, the cultural revolution began, in the crazy struggle, Kong made a straight call to 'down Mao Zedong'. In October 1966, the six squadron disciplined He Qingyun announced that he had declared the death penalty for his outrage against Mao Zedong and anti-Cultural Revolution (later the team captain Guo Chuan Xiao told Kong lingping, because the first hand of the farm Gao De Sheng (against, death penalty is not permitted), and the sentencing conference was held on 21 April 1967 to impose the sentence up to 20 The case was closed in the year. \\n\\tIn June 1968, the Nong Six team carried out a streak battle, a seven-day hunger strike to protest against Kong lingping. \\n\\tIn 1974, the Correctional Department once again warned Kong lingping and opposing Mao Zedong to kill. \\nMeng Zi said: 'We have the world's talent and education.' The Communist Party is 'destroyed by the world's talent.' The first is the destruction of schools and teachers of excellence, and the second is the destruction of young people, adolescents and even children who can be talented. Kong's house was destroyed four: two teachers, two students. \\nIn short, none of those who refused to leave China in 1949 or return to China after 1949, both active and unsolicited, have no good end. Therefore, the so-called 'glorious 60 years' of the Communist Party of China is simply unfounded and shameless self-protests. \\nKong lingping left his works include 'Blood Trilogy', 'My Mother Fang Jianzhi' and many online articles. \\nI write to send it-\\nMr. Kong lingping Immortal\\nSixty years of grievance\\nBloody and Tears Two Books\\nHong Kong 57 Society Wu Yi San and all colleagues\\nOctober 10, 2009 in Zhanqin Villa\\n('Exposure' starting)\\nPAGE 7"}

If his motives were patriotic, I would agree with him. The foreign aid budget has not yet been published. I don't know too much or too little. But according to the facts of the past, I think too much. Aid to North Korea and Vietnam each 800 million yuan, the Soviet Union only gives North Korea 1 billion rubles, the equivalent of our aid to the DPRK 1/2 million, to Vietnam 400 million rubles, equivalent to 1/4 weaker in our country's aid, while the Soviet economy is much stronger than our country, the total investment in the sixth five-year plan amounts to 99,000 billion rubles, equivalent to the first of our country The total investment in the five-year plan is more than 60 times. Can you say that the Soviet Union has no internationalism? No, it is our country that has helped too much. These do not go to say, give a democratic country, even a little more, is to my own brothers, I have no opinion. But the support for Egypt amounts to 20 million Swiss francs, (about 5 million US dollars), while India, which is more developed than our country, is about $1 million in aid; Cambodia 8 million pounds (about 50 million yuan); and Nepal 30 million rupees (about 20 million yuan), in order to bring these countries from Pull it out in the circle of USAID. I really don't understand, can our country's economic power compare with the ability of the United States to aid foreign countries internationally? I think that our country's current aid is mainly morally and politically, rather than economically and 'US aid'. 'In the case of the anti-revolutionary group of Hu Feng and Panhannian, the vast majority of the people of the country have been involved in this matter, but the verdict has not yet been seen. Is the Party Central Committee engaged the masses in a struggle against the anti-revolutionaries without letting the people across the country know the charges of the anti-revolutionaries, and not announcing the trial process and results to the people?' 'We only know that 'Gao Gang and Rao Shushi form an anti-party alliance, 'conspiracy to seize the highest leadership of the country, 'but the specific thing is not known at all. It is only based on trust in the Party Central Committee, and also denounced the high ambitions. But we also know that Gao Rao had merit to the Party and the State in the past, whether they were beaten to death by a stick because they raised opinions with other leaders within the Party Central Committee or committed those mistakes, as pointed out by the Party Central Committee? The fact that the Party Central Committee declares that this is another great victory in the history of our party? At the same time, soon after the Fourth Plenum of the 7th Central Committee, the leaders of the communist parties all gathered in Beijing to celebrate our national day. Among them Khrushchev, he did not mention congratulating us on this victory, does it mean that the other fraternal parties in the Soviet Republic have a different view on this matter? The Party Central Committee also declared: 'Their previous work is wiped out. ' Because they made mistakes. But according to my reasoning: Stalin's error (in terms of its objective effect), is much more serious than high rao, but my Party Central Committee gave him a 'three-point error and seven credit' assessment, which seems somewhat unfair. The timely discovery and handling of the high rao anti-party coalition is not only another great victory in the history of our party, but also a great victory for the people of the whole country. We ask the Party Central Committee to announce the original commission of this matter (Stalin's mistakes can still be announced, let alone both)? Let the people of the whole country rest assured.' 'I hope to change the brand of our college to a teacher's secondary school, which is more practical, because the level of language is not as high school.'

Such as the famous dish beauty point is to play a desire to enjoy, and say increase production saving, such as 'cowboy weaving women can not meet', Liu Shaoqi said 'little left home boss back'. To say that little democracy is good, it makes people feel that socialist democracy is rare. I am in favor of greater democracy, and the municipal committee should not propagate and make illusions. Liu Shaoqi called people to see the 'People's Daily' editorial. Who looks at the editorial so long? I see that as long as the communist children go down first, they can not have to propagate. Some of the communist children, bourgeois enjoyed, and the bourgeois did not educate their children in the past.'

'I'm not saying that it is not possible for workers to express their views, but the problem is that the host of the meeting is wrong attitude. It may be to see business and industry now criticize the government and take up the workers, especially when the Southern Daily and Guangzhou Daily receive this news, why don't we think well about the city.

Kang de is a deputy chairman of the Changsha City Committee of the NLD, Hunan Political Consultative Conference, Changsha City Bureau of Culture. Before liberation, Kang de used to rely on the KMT's special agency for a long time and had always opposed the CPC and opposed the cause of the people's revolution. After liberation, his thieves did not change, clandestinely organized a 'literary and artistic salon', gathered the right-wing elements, pulling the backward masses, reversing black and white, falsifying rumors, slandering the Communist Party of China and opposing socialism. In May 1957, when the party proposed the wind, Kang de thought that the time was ripe to overthrow the CPC leadership, and launched a general attack on the party. \\nStigmatization of the socialist system, attempt to abolish party leadership\\nThe anti-revolutionary riots that erupted in Hungary in October 1956 were suppressed, and Kang de used it to propagate the fallacy against socialism. He said that 'the socialist system produces individualism, Stalin is criticized,' defaming the anti-Leninist culture of personal adoration of Stalin, 'the product of the socialist system.' At the same time, he also opposes the campaign to clear the anti-revolutionaries, criticizing 'the anti-revolutionary movement was wrong, many people don't know why they were fighting', shouting for the counter-revolutionaries, and instructed Ouyang Minne and other anti-opponents to make the case, inciting them to ask for the release of the original file material to the Party committee. Kang de also has a carved hatred of the Party newspaper. He slammed the party newspaper as 'a big family', cursing 'reading the party newspaper as against Yan Shi', cursing the 'New Hunan newspaper' as 'one, two, three, four, a, b, c, and Ding's dogmatism', and openly proclaimed the 'Party newspaper private office', in fact, it is up to them to the right The elements took over; and actively orchestrated the 'companion newspaper' in order to sing against the party newspaper as their anti-party anti-social The Pulpit of Thealism. Kang de opposes Marxism, saying that 'the work of drama change is not what Marxism can lead.' On the art issue, he has consistently opposed the principle of the political standard first and second artistic standard proposed by Chairman Mao, saying that Chairman Mao's statement is wrong. It should be 'art standard first, at least art and politics parallel', in an attempt to attack Marxists' standards of evaluation of literature and art. \\nKang de has viciously neglected its achievements to attack the party, openly slander the Communist Party 'do not understand business.' He said, 'The provincial and municipal culture bureau party organization does not understand the characteristics of entertainers, do not care about the artist's life'. All are 'fake hands, laymen, don't understand pretending to understand', 'messed up the Xiqu work in Hunan,' and 'Hunan performing arts should be passed off.' And rumors everywhere said: 'Old artists will be forced to hang the neck, jump.' 'Hunan starved to death entertainers, the party and the government do not heed.' 'These people (referring to the party's leading comrades in literary work), have done good things into bad things.' At the same time, 'Hunan literary people have been lightened' in an attempt to provoke intellectuals grievances with the party in order to follow them with the opposition party. During the period, Kangde's reactionary group also drew up a list of provincial and municipal cultural directors. In this list, Kang de is the provincial director of culture, Chen Yuxin is deputy director, Yan Qifu is the city's director of culture, and Huang Zengfu is deputy director. These three people are the backbone of the Kang de right-wing group, and it is clear that Kang de conspiracy to usurp the leadership of the party has been deliberate for a long time. \\nDisinformation deceived the development of allies, delusions to the Allied Party\\nEver since the Party proposed a policy of 'long-term coexistence and mutual supervision', the right-wing group of the NLD has had unintentional efforts to develop organizations and delusions of the Alliance. NLD Vice Chairman Zhang Bojun proposed a plan to develop 1 million, 5 million and 8 million Allied members. At the end of last year, the central right group of the NLD sent another working group to Hunan to carry out Zhang Bojun's big development plan in the name of inspecting the alliance, saying that 'the Hunan NLD cannot catch up with the situation,' and development organizations have a tendency to 'cloting-off'. After Kang de got this instruction, Kang de really flourished, shouting 'many people are good to call the king', many rallies planned in the secret chamber, sent minions Qian Wenyuan, Ding Guoquan, etc. to run at the grassroots level, pulling people everywhere by means; and distorted the policy of 'long-term coexistence and mutual supervision', saying, 'Mutual supervision is the people' 'The League's supervision of the Communist Party' and preached that 'the NLD and the Communist Party are fraternal parties'. Chairman Mao proposed 'Long live two lives'. 'Democratic parties have a head.' After spreading these absurd rhetoric, Kang de openly proclaimed among intellectuals: 'The NLD is the party of the most knowledgeable and competent people. If you do not have the ability and knowledge, it is not the Communist Party.' Attempts to solidify the intellectuals in the cultural and educational world with this popularity. For example, among entertainers, Kang de said: 'The NLD is a political party in the art world, and entering the Union can pass through the country.' Use this to deceive entertainers into the League. In the development of the Allied, Kang de put special emphasis on pulling backward elements. He said: 'The backward is also representative.' In order to develop the Allied and expand his political capital, Kang de also chooses to discredit the masses. For example, he said to a person with historical problems: 'The Communist Party says you have historical problems, cannot absorb you into the party, you join us in the NLD.' To those who ask for progress, Kang de pretended to understand the inside and said: 'You have already obtained the agreement of the Party Committee for you to join the League.' Attempts to deceive the masses in this way. Not only that, Kang de also uses guest and gifts to pull people into the Union, and spread the so-called 'two-step walk' argument of 'first entry to the Union and then into the party' everywhere. He plans to develop hundreds of alliances in the provincial and municipal literary circles alone, and then use them to control various cultural departments and artistic groups in the province and city. Under the insidious initiative of Kang de, at the end of 1956, the NLD Cultural and Art Group, which had only a dozen allies, had developed to 34 by April 1957, respectively, respectively. There are two branches of literature, arts and drama. \\nThis kind of violation of the Allied Chapter of Kang de, unscrupulous development of allies by no means, intentions are extremely vicious. He tried to establish his reactionary stronghold in cultural units across the province first, expand the power of the right, and then usurp the party's leadership to achieve his political ambitions of 'how good to be king'. \\nOrganize 'literary salon', actively plan open black shop, attack to the party\\nKang de's anti-socialist anti-socialism has long been premeditated, and as early as 1952, he has organized a group of right-wing black shops called 'art salon' ('salon' means the living room). The group is headed by Kangde. Its backbone elements are Chen Yuxin, Jiang Shoushi, Dong Bikan, Wei Mengke, Yan Qiaoyu, Huang Zengfu, Ouyang Minne, Tian Hong, Zhai Yi and so on. They often gathered in Kang de and Jiang Shoushi's homes, and used Yinyuan Tea House, Deyuan Restaurant as a meeting place. They also organized 'weekly meetings' and 'transfers' to unite some of the outsiders and carry out conspiracy activities to pull people together. Through the rally of the 'Art Salon', they planned a set of anti-party platforms. From the beginning of the Party's rectifying movement, Kang de first launched a general offensive against the party within the coalition organization, put forward the slogan 'only to talk about the shortcomings, not to talk about achievements', and sent a general general Zhai Yi and Ding Guoquan to go the dog to ignition and collect materials. Zhai Yi, following the instructions of Kangde, from the provincial culture bureau cadres gold style, cheated a copy of more than 8,000 words of fabricated facts, reversing black and white materials, as a shells to attack the party. During the meeting of the provincial CPPCC, they came up more rampant, set out a set of strategies to attack the party, division of responsibilities, by Kang de to attack the party from the opera work, Chen Yuxin attacked the party from cultural relics management, Zhai Yi attacked the party from the aspect of supporting folk entertainers, and Tian Hong attacked the party from the aspect of artist's life. The five strategies they set out are: ① Attack Targets Centralized Provincial Bureau of Culture. ② Not to people, with the fact that someone will be responsible. ③ Comments from the work of the respective post. ④ Multi-party motionings (that is, to bring together people attending and attending the meetings of the provincial CPPCC, attack the party). ⑤ Wei Mengke's speech is the focus. In addition, Jiang Shoushi prepared Tian Hong's statement in advance. Certainly. As soon as the CPPCC meeting was opened, the gods of the cattle and ghosts went out together. At the same time, they also threw up a set of organizational plans such as 'co-man theatre troupe' and 'same people newspaper', and by Tian Hong as head of the 'Tongren Theatre'; Jiang Shoushi was the manager of the Hunan theater; Wei Mengke was president of the 'same man newspaper'; Kang de was deputy president and editor in chief; including editors, reporters and other personnel of the 'co-man newspaper' The arrangement, according to their wishful calculations, only one journalist based in Beijing was missing. In addition, they are preparing to open a black shop at 'Actors House' as a stronghold for entertainers. They also clearly set out a 'route' to attack the party. This route is: 'Clearing the periphery first, then pounding its core', which is to first get rid of party people, such as Liu Feizhang, deputy director of the provincial culture bureau, Yan Jine and other comrades, and then tack the core, that is, overthrowing the Communist Party leadership. Kang de said: provincial literary leaders comrades 'are all cocks, must be uprooted.' Even connected pipe plans have been done, by Kang de catch drama; Wei Mengke catch literary arts; Chen bath new grabs relics, books, etc. The Kang de right-wing group attacked the party, which has reached the highest level, Zhangluo Union-Dukang Alliance-Kang Kee 'Literary Salon', just like a black line directly connected. They carried out a planned, organized, programmed and directed attack against the party and socialism. \\nKang de Gender-30 Years of Anti-Communist Criminals\\nKang de was an anti-Communist culprit for 30 years. He disguised progress, once mixed with Hengshan County Peasant Association as secretary, but by the failure of the Revolution in 1927, he immediately rebelled the revolution and fled to Wuhan to join the Kuomintang. In 1928, he worked at the party department of Changsha County of the Kuomintang Party. He had published anti-Communist publications, engaged in anti-Communist propaganda, and shamelessly spread anti-communist rhetoric such as 'Communism is not compatible with China's national circumstances' and 'China has no class, only the difference between great poverty and poverty'. After the incident in Ma Ri, the Kuomintang frenzy carried out a 'shovel congregation' and massacre of Communist Party members and patriots. Kang de and anti-Communist leaders Liu Houmin and Yuan Tongchou joined forces to serve as correctional instructors in Hunan's 'correctional home' (that is, concentration camps). In 1930, Kang de also served as the author officer of the Changsha citizen's 'Shovel Communist Propaganda Committee'; capitalized anti-Communist articles for the last edition of the 'Shovel Communist Party', defaming 'the Communist Party is a cripist who kills and sets fire' and insults Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong, the leaders of the Communist Party and China's historical peasant uprising, saying, 'The Communist Party has offered more than invading and beyond'. At the end of his anti-communist editorial, he also proposed 14 anti-Communist slogans such as 'we should support the general command of He (that is, the anti-Communist leader), to shovel a total of 14 anti-Communist slogans, 'We want to support the army, the regiment against the shovel.' In 1936, Kang de relied on the forces of the Renaissance agency agent Lexi age, in Changsha to do the 'Libo', in October of the same year, Lexi introduced Kang de joined the Renaissance. After Xue Yue came to power in 1938, he appreciated Kang de's anti-Communist 'talents', specially picked him back from Shaoyang, invited him to eat, and asked him to be a commissioner of the pseudo provincial capital. In 1947, Kang de relying on military uniformity, through the head of the military unifying agent Tang longitudinal, was directly approved by the Central Proclamation Department of the Nanjing Kuomintang, and republished the Evening News, directly controlled by Huang Kangyong, webmaster of Hunan Bureau of the Military Unification Bureau. Kang de served as deputy president and editor-in-chief of the evening news. It was also extremely defamatory to the Communist Party, defaming the Communist Party as 'Communist bandits'. In the evening newspaper it was filled with the words of anti-Communist people such as 'bandits,' 'bandits,' and 'all-ji-share bandits', and the great leaders of the Chinese people Chairman Mao, cursed as a 'magician'. In 1947, when the head of the military agent, He Jian, visited Hunan, Kang de was one of the main guests at the banquet of Ho Jian. At the same time, at the Lanzhaoqi family, He Jian also taught Kang Tak and other faces. \\nIn 1948, when my liberation army approached the Yangtze River and Jiang's dynasty, Kang Tak did a poem in the evening newspaper to praise Chiang Kai-shek's 'great achievements'. Unfortunately Chiang Kai-shek's eight words were bad. Hate the Chinese people seemed 'shouldn't' see Chiang Kai-shek as a king. \\nThis is Kang de's past 30 years of anti-Communist anti-people. \\nKang de is a veteran right-wing, an outright anti-Communist anti-people culprit. Before liberation, he had always engaged in anti-Communist activities. After liberation, he disguised 'progress'. After liberation, the Party and the people condoned his evils and arranged for him to be a member of the CPPCC and head of the Changsha City Cultural Bureau, while Kang de has always been hostile to the Communist Party, hostile to the people, the new society. Conspiracy to usurp the party's leadership, overthrow the world of the people, dream of making corrupt imperialism, bureaucratic bourgeoisie Restoration, it is too flawed. Now, this veteran right-wing elements, under the iron fist of the masses of anti-right struggles against the right, have been revealed in their original shape. There is no other way out except for the complete disarming and surrender of their arms and really asking for sin from the people! (Right Faces, Hunan People's Publishing House, 1957)\\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attachment 2】Hu Jian: 'Anti-Socialist Black Shop-'Art Salon' (1957.8.7)\\nIn the struggle against the right in the arts departments of Hunan Province and Changsha, a right-wing group headed by a standing member of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the NLD, the Vice Chairman of the Changsha Municipal Committee and the Director of Changsha City Culture Bureau Kangde-was revealed. Members of this 'art salon' and its peripheral organizations have penetrated almost all departments of culture and art in the provinces and cities. They took advantage of the opportunity of the Communist Party to carry out a rampant attack on the arts and arts departments of Hunan Province and Changsha city under the leadership of the Party in an organized, planned, programmatic and strategic manner. \\nThe right-wing group headed by NLD Provincial Committee Secretary General Dumai is the stronghold of Zhangluo League in Hunan. Kang de, in turn, is the core of Dumai's right-wing group. In their rampant attacks on the party, they have a division of labor, and Kang de's sharp knives point to the arts department. Thus, Zhang Luo Union-Dukang Alliance-Kang Kee 'Art Salon' forms a black line against communist anti-socialism. \\n'Art Salon' was established in the early days of liberation. Since the liberation of the reactionary group, the core elements of this reactionary group have stole many important positions in provincial and municipal literary organizations. Kangde is the director of Changsha City Cultural Bureau, Wei Mengke is the director of the Hunan Cultural Association, Chen Yuxin is the director of the Hunan Provincial Cultural Relics Committee, Tian Hong is the manager of Hunan theater, Jiang Shoushi is the manager of Yinxing cinema, Yan Qifu is a teacher of Changsha Normal College, Zhai Yi is the art guide of Hunan shadow puppet troupe But they also want to further exclude Communist Party members and hold all power. Among them, except Tian Hong, a development target for NLD not yet joined the Union and Chen Yuxin is a Standing Committee member of the Democratic Revolution Provincial Committee, the rest are NLD members, and they are all provincial or municipal people's representatives or members of the CPPCC. After the establishment of the reactionary organization, they met weekly at the Yinyuan Tea House or private home in Changsha City to provide advice to each other in search of gaps to attack the party. They are literary, so they call this gathering 'art salon.' In this party's rectification movement, they assembled more often to study the strategy and methods of attacking the party. \\nThe outlying organizations of the 'Arts and Arts Salon' are also 'Transfers' (aka Sunday Meeting), made up of Allied members and right-wing elements of AU members. Through these outlying organizations, they have brought together a large number of so-called Forces nouvelles. According to the current identification, in the main sections of the provincial and municipal cultural bureaux, the provincial literary union, provincial literary and artistic dry schools, Hunan People's Publishing House, and Hunan People's Radio Station, almost all of them have established their own strongholds. They also shared a voice with Dong Perinan, a right-wing activist in Guangzhou. \\nAt the end of last year, the central faction of the NLD, under the control of right-wing ambitions, came up with a working group called 'inspection alliances' to trade 'private goods' of Zhangluo Union, 'criticizing' the Hunan NLD for 'not catching up with the situation' and having a serious 'shutdown'. This caused the Dukang right-wing group to flourish, calling everywhere 'how good people are king' and that 'the NLD has a head.' They meet regularly to study and arrange, examine the development alliance, and send a large number of 'competent' cadres to pull people into the League by all means of despicable means. For example, 'Mutual supervision of each other is mainly the supervision of the Communist Party by the NLD', 'the NLD organization only accepts instructions from the CPC Central Committee', 'The NLD is the most knowledgeable, technical and capable political party. It has no knowledge or ability, even if members of the Communist Party join the Union, do not want to do so even if members of the Communist Party join the Union.' People 'decided to join the alliance' and other means of deceiving, threatening, and enticing, pulling people into the Union, and attempting to use the Alliance. \\nAt the beginning of May, when Hunan began to magnify the song, right-wing elements of the 'literary salon' proposed a so-called 'combat plan' full of gunpowder flavor: 'Shoushou Municipal Bureau of Culture, attacking the Provincial Bureau of Culture'. Their 'strategy' is: 'up and down attack, inside and outside, ignition everywhere'. On, it is to fabricate the facts, to inform the Central Committee and to the provincial committee of the provincial culture bureau of the 'like'; under, it is to provoke, fabricate rumors, ignition, smoke among the entertainers masses; pull up cadres inside the party; outward, seize entertainers, cultural people and elements who are dissatisfied with the party, and a set of so-called 'catch' and 'hit' ', 'hit' is to 'catch' the insidious and vicious way. Their offensive slogan is: 'Be full of stars, put sparks'. Kang de and other right-wing leaders released at the rally 'attack, attack again!' The 'Battle Order'. The right-wing group of 'Arts and Arts Salon' often rallies in order to discuss how to launch a 'total offensive' to the party. In the first three days before the meeting of the Hunan Provincial CPPCC held in late May, they gathered at the right core, Jiang Shoushi's family to study the five principles to speak: (1), not to speak from the Bank, give opinions from their own work, then the shortcomings of the leadership are naturally exposed; (2), do not point out the name, as long as opinions It is proposed that natural people are responsible; (3), to seize the facts and find the gap in the job; (4), the target of the attack is The Provincial Bureau of Culture should hit hard and beat correctly; (5), to launch the 'masses', to seize entertainers, cultural people and people attending meetings of the provincial CPPCC, to create a sweeping atmosphere. On the basis of this 'offensive' principle, they made a specific division of labour. Such as Kang de attacked the party's literary leadership and the party newspaper, the New Hunan Newspaper, etc. \\nAs a result, they sang and echo each other at many of the singing events. Kang de, Jiang Shoushi, and Tian Hong forged rumors: 'Hunan drama reform work is a mess.' 'Old artists will be forced to hang the neck, jump.' Wei Mengke, Chen Yuxin shouted: 'Hunan literary creation is not prosperous, literary criticism is almost no.' 'The New Hunan Newspaper has been angry, not a little angry, should consider whether to continue to let this flower bloom.' Kang de threatened: 'Marxinism cannot lead the drama reform work.' Wei Mengke raised the fallacy that 'Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Literary and Art Symposium is no longer enough.' Chen Yuxin openly shouted: 'The Communist Party retracts Marxinism!' They also openly tampered with Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy, saying what 'political standards first, art standards are second wrong; they should be art first, at least art and politics parallel.' Kang de also slandered what 'literary people are lightened' in Hunan. 'Democrats have no right to work,' he even shouted with arrogance: 'There is no one in the Hunan Party who understands the cultural cause at all', and the other right-wing elements of this group say, 'If the examination system is in place, all communist members will have to go down. 'Taiwan', 'Party members get there, it's bad.' Chen bath new hated: 'Laozi will one day come with him (referring to the Communist people), a white knife into, red knife out.' See how much their hatred of the Communist Party is! \\nThese rampant right-wing core elements, mainly through the NLD and the 'Art Salon' organization, attacked the party. They have held several meetings of grass-roots cadres of the NLD to 'mobilize' and called on everyone to put forward their opinions to find out the target: 'Only mention party members, not to mention democratic personalities; only mention shortcomings, not achievements.' What to say 'the sharper opinion, the better, whistle can be made, must storm'. What also says, 'China's revolution cannot be led by the Communist Party', 'Farmers in the land reform are not willing to fight landlords, fighting is a fake struggle', and slandered 'three and anti-five contrasts' is 'a tax', shouting 'anti-counter expansion', and inciting opposition to writing an article like 'grievance'. Xiao Yunduan, a Communist Party member who was pulled by right-wing elements, openly encouraged students to march to the streets. \\nKang de and his 'Art Salon' also plotted to provoke party relations in the literary world. Last year the central government allocated 200,000 yuan and 140,000 yuan in the province to provide relief to entertainers who have difficulties in their lives, Kang de said that he appealed to the central government and to Tian Han, only the provincial committee was forced to take these measures. The right-wing elements of the 'Arts and Arts Salon' also regularly use the name of the Central Theatre Association Chairman Tian Han to collect distorted material as 'evidence' and 'justification' for attacking the provincial culture bureau. \\nDuring the reactionary group, the reactionary group also regularly celebrates their 'victory', and arrogously said: 'This time, it looks like the restructuring of the provincial culture bureau is set.' So, they took the opportunity to make all the 'takeover plans' of the provincial and municipal arts departments. They also draw up a list of the organizations and all the personnel of the so-called 'co-man' and 'companion troupe'. and attacked the new Hunan newspaper and the state-owned Hunan Xiang Opera Troupe. \\nThey arrogant to draw up a list of all the successors of leading cadres of provincial and municipal arts departments after the stepping down of office. The main figures in this list are: Du mai is the provincial education department, vice chairman of the Hunan CPPCC, Kang de is the provincial director of the Cultural Bureau, Chen Yu new deputy director of the Culture Bureau of Changsha City, Wei Mengke is the director of the Cultural Federation and President of the Associated Newspaper, Jiang Shoushi as manager of Hunan theater, Tian Hongren Head of State-owned Xiang Opera Troupe or the same person troupe, Zhai Yiren Shadow Puppet Troupe, head of art industry leaders, etc. and plans to get out for 30 people at Hunan People's Publishing House. Attempts to place Hunan literary and artistic circles entirely under the rule of the right-wing group of the 'art salon'. \\nTheir usurpation of the editorial department of New Miao, the only literary publication in Hunan province, began long ago. Here, Wei Menke and his lover, Communist Party member Zhou Weilin, were in control. The July issue of 'New Seedlings' was choreographed by Wei Mengke himself. He specifically put up some reactionary poems such as cursing Hunan literary leadership's 'motherhood theory'. Wei Mengke also personally painted a caricature titled 'Creation Conveying Report' on a malicious attack on the party's literary and artistic leadership cadres. Because the anti-right struggle had been waged, it was rushed out at the time of publication. \\nWhy is the right-wing group of the 'art salon' hate party and socialism? Just give a brief introduction to the history of several right-wing leaders, and you can know it. \\nKang de joined the Kuomintang in 1924 and served as a correctional instructor and 'member of the Communist Committee' in the pseudo-' correctional homes' (later concentration camps), that brutally persecuted communists and revolutionaries after the events of 1927. He also participated in the 'Renaissance'. He served as deputy president and editor-in-chief of the KMT agent Tang longitudinal, Lexi Ling and other people's Office of Libo and Evening News. He is the famous 'head snake' in Changsha City, insulting many female artists. On the eve of liberation, he disguised the Evening News 'left leaning' and 'progress' into the revolutionary team. \\nChen Yuxin has been the chief of education of a warlord Ho Jian and Chief of Staff of Liu Jianxu. He has also served as a pseudo administrative commissioner, security commander, and police commander. He is also the leading brother of the reactionary gang 'Qiankun Zhengqi Mountain'. Eve of liberation, he speculated 'uprising', mixed into the revolutionary lineup. \\nYen strange and foolish during the Great Revolution was an opponent of a rebel party, and Kang de joined forces with military unitary agents capitalist Lan Zhaoqi, the revival activist Ouyang Minneh and others. And with Hu Feng for many years old exchanges, he has close ties with the Hufeng counter-revolutionary group. He is also a 'Renaissance' element. He has served as major propaganda officer of the KMT Special Party Department, officer of the pseudo-central military investigation unit and secretary of the Major. He also served as president and lead pen in Li Banzongli's Libao and Morning Newspaper. He also wrote articles such as 'Communism is not suitable for China,' and 'Communism is a troubled political party' and other bloody articles. \\nBut when these right-wing ambitions clashed to celebrate 'victory', the masses uncovered the inside of the 'art salon', crushing their usurpation plot. Now, the group has been isolated and is collapsing, and the masses are closely united around the party to further relentlessly struggle against right-wing elements.

The Inner Mongolia District Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that Kong and Zeng (first), have serious ideas of changing the day and that there have been local agent activities in history. Thinking that the Party's proposal to ask outside the party to help the party to rectify and 'Ming and put' policy is because Hungarian events are also going to occur in China. The internal contradictions of the people come to the brink of confrontational contradictions, and the people will rise up and try to force the Party to give concessions to him in order to 'equate the fall' with the party's 'chamber resistance'. Wait for the three world wars to try to 'Higashiyama again'. The achievements of the vilification of the Chinese revolution 'are the landlords, the money of capitalists, the lives of the poor.' Inner Mongolia's 'achievements are years old', if some people say that the results are the main ones, it is 'eight shares,' and slandering Chairman Mao is 'dictatorship', and slandering the Party is 'the same one where fascist party power is superior to all', 'one party dictatorship', 'Party inability, not to do it. 'Go', ask the party 'learn Yao Shun Zen let'. Their approach is to expand the Inner Mongolia CPPCC organization and bring together non-party organizations. They are representing all non-party personalities, making them 'actually a big party' and implementing a bipartisan system. They stigmatized party members into a group of 'drinking human blood, drinking people sweat,' 'fake activists' and 'ideological positions' who rely on party cards to eat, 'grace people, air conditioners force people', 'enjoy first, suffer after suffering', 'Party grandfather', 'minions', and therefore concluded that 'Party melting' 'There is a danger of becoming a worker aristocracy'. Already 'came out of the people and stood above the people'. They denigrate the socialist system by saying that 'the root causes of the three bad practices are the system.' The current personnel system is less than complete. Requesting the abolition of the secrecy system of personnel, non-parties should also participate in the management. They oppose 'the establishment of so many autonomous regions' 'will surely split' in the future, and Mungsui merger is a situation of 'restoration of the Chinese rule by the Yuan Dynasty and Mongolian people.' Mengga party members are 'safe to eat' and 'are first-class cadres'. It is the old method of sending a party member for each family of Yuan Dynasty, and will one day repeat the August 15 killing of Dazi. To provoke ethnic relations and say that the Mongolian tribes are predominantly, or 'the main Main customers? Or the Lord Slave' relationship? They describe the party relationship as a 'Lord and Slave' relationship. Divide intifada personnel and non-party cadres into 'old criminals, new offenders, not guilty', saying that non-party people 'have no authority' are 'puppets'. The policy of stigmatizing the people of the uprising is to 'take care of the upper level, use the lower layer, hit the middle level', 'a pair of gods, open the door inside, close the door to the outside', turning the party ugly into a sectarianist collective. 'You can't enter the group without slippery.' Attacking the party's preferential captive and uprising policies are 'the hottest means.' They slandered the transformation of their ideas as 'Xing Word Prison'. The Three Anti-Five Anti-Five Anti-Five Anti-Five Movement is to 'squeeze oil' to cadres and capitalists. The anti-counter movement is 'playing prestige', 'killing too many people' and 'overfire', and setting up a committee to ensure that there is a clear, counterproductive and correct error. State-owned industries and businesses are 'striving for profit with the people', and insurance companies are 'gambling, deceiving people,' and 'the Communist Party's tax is no less than that of the KMT. They say, 'The old society is bad."},

By late August 552 right-wing elements had been revealed. There are 73 far-right molecules (backbone molecules). The right-wing elements include 19 Communist Party members, 72 members of the Communist Youth League and 16.48 per cent of the total number of right-wing members. In terms of only 50 struggles with right-wing units, 11 right-wing struggles have ended, rightists have pleaded guilty, 38 rightists have fought for one or several segments; 94 right-wing elements are fighting and 67 are ready to fight. More than 255 right-wing elements are not prepared to fight. As a result of this struggle, the influence of some right-wing elements in the masses has been virtually eliminated, the mentality of the general masses has greatly increased, and the middlemen have moved closer to us. \\nHowever, there are also a number of problems in the fight against the right:\\n(1), While the queuing process has progressed earlier, it is still not meticulous enough. Of the 69 units of the organs directly under the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, very few have classified rightists as far-right and general right-wing elements respectively. Only a few units have identified the backbone and key elements. Nor are the middle right molecules delineated. Many units divide the center right into the right, and the right into the center right. Some units (such as the Meteorological Bureau of Inner Mongolia), have also identified so-called 'dead right' (referring to historical problems and some erroneous discourse). Some units have classified the right as 'middle right', but treat them according to the right, and have engaged in a struggle, as is the Animal Husbandry Department of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. \\nIn addition, some units and regions are not tight enough for queuing work. The anti-right struggle has been going on in the country and Inner Mongolia for a month or two. Many right-wing rhetoric has been found in some areas, but it is still too late to pull out right-wing elements, such as the Hulunbuir coalition level organs, have so far not discharged a right-wing element. Only one right-wing element was discharged from the Pingdi Springs district. \\n(ii), In terms of methods of struggle, most units have engaged in a rational struggle based on small meetings, appropriately combined with the General Assembly approach. However, some units use more congresses, some units 'hit, scolded', 'penalize stations' and inappropriately 'slogan'; some unorganized post insulting, abusive articles and cartoons on the streets or in the homes of right-wing elements; some units take simple questioning, ordering the confession of special service relations and history Sins on the background of small groups, such as Sun Qingzhen of the right-wing The struggle, too much questioning his backstage, agent relations, resulting in the struggle to form a 'top cow' state, progress is slow. Some units have hidden seven sleeping pills to commit suicide because of improper methods of struggle or policy of dealing with them. Some right-wing elements of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Post and Telecommunications Bureau are looking for an end. For example, Soo Bingrui (member of the Communist Youth League), feared to expelling their registrations, lowering their posts, without face to see people, hiding seven sleeping pills to commit suicide; Threatened to jump the lake, and so on. \\n(3), The leadership comrades of some units, from learning documents to critical right-wing speech, do not take part in the leadership, only by comrades from party branches, and thus manifest themselves in weak leadership over anti-right struggles, and even the masses of some units have generated negative emotions and sympathetic ideas. Some of the intermediaries have not been actively involved in the struggle. In the group of Lu Jianfei, a struggling right-wing member of the Inner Mongolia CPPCC, some people are not only small, but also tired of emotions. Zhou Jun, vice chairman of the Inner Mongolia Science Science Association, said to the reporter that the struggle for the last two months is nothing more than these old problems. He also feels that continuing to fight will waste more precious time and energy.. \\nThe above issues have attracted the attention of the local party committee. On the evening of August 28, at a telephone meeting held by the Inner Mongolia Party Committee secretary of Inner Mongolia, Comrade Wang Duo, secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party Committee of the Communist Party Committee of Inner Mongolia, made a report on continuing deep winds and anti-right struggles.

Even Yang Shangkun (head of the Central Office of the Communist Party of China), Li Bozhao, the wife of Yang Shangkun (head of the Central Office of the Communist Party of China's Central Committee), did not marry Wu Zuguang. May I ask, in the new China of the Party world and the right world, Wu Zuguang is not right, is there a natural sense? How many people advised Xinfeng Xia to divorce when Wu Zuguang was hit as the biggest right-wing in the drama world! Liu Zhiming, the long-coveted deputy minister of the Ministry of Culture, thought that the water went into, and could take advantage of it; but the new Fengxia, who was honest, didn't want to give back: 'He is a good man, I wait for him.' 'Xue Pinggui Congjun, I went for 18 years, then I waited for him 28 years.' So Xinfeng Xia also became a right-wing element. \n",

He gave a lecture entitled 'The Hungry University-Memory of Famine in the 60s', and I went around the end and listened to. \\nProfessor Kong xianghua, Shandong, seems to be the 72 generations of Confucius. Worldly troubled, college student era was defeated as a counter-revolutionary, after 20 years of hardship, insisted on self-study in an extremely difficult environment, painstakingly studied the four books, five scriptures, and hundreds of theories, and later worked in the East China Normal University library, focusing on Chinese culture, especially Confucius and Confucianism. He then resigned the Journal of East China Normal University (Philosophy and Social Science Edition), as editor, deputy editor and editorial editor until retirement. There are many works such as 'Confucius Dictionary' and 'Introduction to Chinese Studies'. \\nHonestly, Professor Kong's keynote speech on the day 'Hungry Universities' was not very wonderful; because universities, especially in Shanghai, had certain guarantees of food supply, although it was also 'hungry', but there was a difference between heaven and earth. The vast majority of the more than 40 million people who died of starvation at that time (the most conservative estimate), were peasants and ultra-intensive labour, psychologically persecuted right-wing elements and other 'class enemies' such as land, rich, anti-anti-and bad, and so on, seem to have not yet been the case of university students starving. \\nIn three years of the Great Famine, I and most of my family survived by eating banana juice, straw fibers, wild gars, and so on; only my mother was unable to escape that man-made disaster, and suffered edema disease and died of hunger, and was 41 years old. Of course, the culprit was Mao Zedong and his group of central members of the CPC Central Committee, but the direct killer was my two uncle, my mother's brothers and brothers. The two uncle was a team captain and the other was a team accountant. In the age of famine, their power really brought them to the realm of winds and rain, eat more and take advantage of men and women. My father said a few words about them because he was not accustomed to what they did; and they took advantage of the death of the ducks of the production team that my father had nurtured, and took the rations of our house. My two uncles became executioners who killed their sister. \\nSo, during the discussion and question of Professor Kong, I sent the following fallacy. \\n"}

With this voluminous genealogy down, a general overview of the more than 2,000 years of history covering the evolution of more than seventy generations of Confucius descendants, people can believe to list a series of celebrities, such as: Confucius grandson, the grandson of Confucius, the ninth grandson of Confucius, the pear of Confucius (Confucius), Confucius 32 Sun, Tang Dynasty Master of Economics Kong xiangmian Yingda, Confucius 69 Sun, Qing Dynasty Calligrapher Kong xiangmian Following Su, Confucius Seventieth Sun, Qing Dynasty mathematician Kong xiangmian Guangsen, Confucius 77 Sun, Confucius Seventy-seventh Sun, today's famous educator in Taiwan, Kong xiangmian Decheng... Their achievements have earned the respect of the world. They are the descendants of Master Kong xiangmian Lao Kong xiangmian. \\nHowever, when these famous Confucius descendants wielded in the memory of people, the attentive readers may have a widening question mark: 'Are there no outstanding women among the Confucius descendants?' There! Of course there! Kong xiangmian Lingren, a professor of history at Shandong University, who is currently Vice Chairman of the NLD Central Committee, the Standing Committee of the CPPCC, is the representative of the outstanding women of Confucius descendants. \\nYi\\nConfucius Lingren, as long as you see the word 'order' in it, you can know that she is a seed of Confucius's seventy-sixth generation. People who know Confucius also know that there is a rare private compound in Qufu, Shandong province, where confucius descendants have been inhabited for generations. With the continuous multiplication of people, the huge Confucius only descendants are difficult to accommodate all, to the time of the sixty generations, by the head of Confucius, the hereditary 'Yan Sheng Gong', lived in the Confucius House, while the other brothers were moved outside to live, self-built house, ranked several houses. The sixty-ninth generation of Confucius was Sun Kong xiangmian Ji Cave, and he was the seventh compound in Qufu's house, called Confucius Ba House. Tracing roots, Sun Lingren belongs to this one, so she was later called 'Miss Kong xiangmian Ba House'. \\nHowever, when Kong xiangmian Lingren came to life in 1924, her birthplace was not in Qufu 'Kong xiangmian Bafu', a deep mansion compound, but in Jinan, Quancheng, because her parents were starting a business in Jinan at that time. 'I've been living in the environment of the House of Books from a young age and received a rigorous and good education.' Talking about life in the early years, triggered the wonderful memories of Kong xiangmian Lingren. Her father Kong xiangmian Xiangmian is Confucius's seventy-fifth generation grandson, graduated from the National Beiping University of Technology, early as a telephone technician of Jinan Electric Light Company, teacher of Shandong Provincial College of Industry, founded Jining, Tai'an, Tengwei County Electric Lighting Factory, self-serving as chief engineer, later became a well-known banker, resist war During the period served as the Central Trust Agency and Manager of the Central Bank of China Industrial Bank of Qingdao and General Manager of Qingdao Agro-Industrial Bank after the victory of the victory of the Central Bank of China, and was elected chairman of the Qingdao Banking Association. Kong xiangmian Xiangmian has three brothers, three brothers and one little sister, and seven brothers received higher education in the early years. Kong xiangmian Lingren's mother in Nanbin is a graduate of Beijing Women's Teachers School. Kong xiangmian Lingren's great-grandfather was the first supervisor of Beijing Normal University (the predecessor of Peking University), and was the first supervisor of the Qing Dynasty College. Kong xiangmian Lingren's grandmother, Lloyd, taught Phonology and Hook Stock Science (Geometry), at Beijing Women's Normal School, and published a mathematical monograph 'Hook shares and prescriptions', is the earliest generation of female teachers in China. The enlightenment of a family environment can often determine a person's career for life. Although Kong xiangmian Lingren later held many important positions in society and frequently appeared on various important occasions as a prominent social activist, she always called herself 'an ordinary teacher.' \\nAs a teenager, Kong xiangmian Lingren studied in Qufu, Nanjing, Shanghai and other places with the migration of his parents. After the outbreak of the war of resistance, she came to Chongqing during the war, and admitted to the best secondary school in the country at that time-Shaping Nankai High School. In this campus where the famous educator Mr. Zhang Boling for the avoidance of the sun, and will advance the education reserve essence from Tianjin to this campus, Kong xiangmian Lingren enrolled in school listening to the 'allow to allow, change' Nankai training, undergo strict and orderly management, smoked with rigorous and conscious and listened to the speech of Chinese Communist Party leader Zhou Enlai. In 1942, she was admitted to the Southwest General Assembly Department of History. Like many aspiring young people, she is committed to the divine cause of fighting and rescue with a full patriotic passion, learning cultural knowledge with hunger and thirst. She is in a short and shabby bungalow, topped with a tin roof, facing the mud wall, in the Ham can sit on a simple desks, accompanied by the sometimes hit sound of wind and rain alarm, painstakingly read, laid a solid foundation for future academic success. At that time, the spring city of Kunming was a major cultural town behind the big back, known as the 'fortress of democracy'. 'I chose 'Poems' which I taught more than one, Shen Congwen's 'History of Chinese Novels', Zhu Ziqing, 'History of Chinese Literature' by Wu Han by Wu Han, 'History of Qin Han' by Lei Haizong, Zheng Tianting's 'History of Ming Qing', Shao Xunzheng's 'Modern History of China', Feng 'History of Chinese Philosophy' taught by Yolan, the knowledge and training gained from these masters have made my life inexhaustible. ' Half a century later, Kong xiangmian Lingren remains deeply forgettable about this. More importantly, the noble practice of smelling more than one, Zhu Ziqing, Wu Han and other democratic fighters that 'rich cannot be good, poor cannot move, and mighty can not be subdued' took root in her heart. \\nAfter the victory of the resistance, the Southwest United University, composed of Tsinghua, Peking University and Nankai, respectively, relocated, Kong xiangmian Lingren in Tsinghua Yuan division Yu Daisun, Yao Congwu, Ka Bangfu and other famous scholars. In 1947, she completed her studies and went to society, but in the years of devastation and war, Kong xiangmian Lingren, who graduated from Tsinghua, was also difficult to find a suitable job. He had to temporarily work as a small staff member at a bank in Qingdao. \\nAfter the founding of the new China, Kong xiangmian Lingren of Fenghua Zhengmao once again raised the ideal sail. In the country's boom to study the 'Big Brother' of the Soviet Union, she entered the Russian course at Shandong University. Asked whether her ideal at the time was intended to be a Russian professor, she laughed and replied: 'No, I wanted to be a journalist.' Cheerful character, perseverance, keen intriguing, funny language, fluent writing are indeed the inherent advantages she has to become a journalist. In 1985, Kong xiangmian Lingren with the feature film 'Confucius Birthplace Line' in the United States, she carried out natural smooth dubbing, explain, received a good effect. Indeed, within her blood relatives, there is also a shortage of reporters worldwide. Her eldest sister Kong xiangmian Ling, who has long served as a senior program presenter for Voice of America, and US President Ford, Reagan, Carter, Bush, Clinton, Secretary of State Kissinger and other world figures, have maintained extraordinary contacts. She also visited China to interview Conk Ching and Chen Muhua. and other state leaders. Kong xiangmian Linghe's daughter (Kong xiangmian Lingren's nephew), Dong Kai-Ti is the famous ABC New York TV prime time news program presenter, hailed as one of the 'three Chinese gold flowers among American television broadcasters'. He has been named several times as the best journalist in the United States and won the 'Outstanding Elite Award', Mulo Memorial Award, 'Best Live Reporting Award', etc. were selected together with Li Zhengdao, Yang Zhenning, Wang An and others Chinese American character, was named one of eleven prominent Chinese American celebrities in 1986. 'Many Chinese Americans cheered loudly because of Dong Kai-ti's achievements: 'Once again, the Chinese nation is a great nation,' Hong Kong xiangmian's weekly report said. His achievements in the United States are no lower than the white people. '' This was reproduced in the 'Reference News' from the mainland. \\nHowever, under the arrangement of the God of Fate, Kong xiangmian Lingren was neither a professor of Russian nor a journalist. \\nWhen Kong xiangmian Lingren is about to complete the Russian language course, the Department of Foreign Languages of Shandong University requested her to teach her in foreign languages in advance. How could the Department of History easily release this senior student at the Southwest General Assembly? Opinions between the two sides cannot be disputed, and finally by the principal Huagang, a hammer: 'The Russian language is a tool for governance, or let her go to the Department of History!' Since then, Kong xiangmian Lingren said goodbye to his journalist dream, left the Russian language profession and stepped into a rigorous and realistic history teaching and research center. This has been for more than 40 years. To this day, in a situation where basic subjects of history and other basic disciplines have been socially destitute, Kong xiangmian Lingren is still unregrettable and happy with his original career choice.

' 'I always keep in mind the teachings of my ancestors, even if I'm tired and busy, giving students classes is always the focus of my work.' Since coaching, Kong xiangmian Lingren has been holding this firm belief. This is the common assessment of all students who have heard Kong xiangmian Lingren lectures. \\nAs a teacher, Kong xiangmian Lingren taught dozens of students, can be called Tao Li full world. 'Three thousand disciples, seventy Sage', which was the teaching of her ancestor Confucius. For more than 40 years, Kong xiangmian Lingren takes the example of his ancestors, and has cultivated a large number of useful talents for the cause of the construction of the motherland, most of them have emerged in all walks of life. As a hard-working gardener, carefully pampering the seedlings of the future, if the Confucius god knows, will also be pleased to his descendants dedicated to the ordinary and great cause of teachers. She has lectured on topics such as modern Chinese history, modern Chinese economic history and modern Chinese economic history. In recent years, we have focused mainly on training graduate students, teachers and mentoring foreign exchange scholars and international students. Her lectures are lively, guided by good, thought-oriented, scientific and fun combined, popular among students. \\nEconomic change is the foundation of social change. To understand the dynamics of an era, it is necessary to understand the economic conditions of that era. As early as the founding of the country, the history of Taidou Yan Zhongping wrote about how to deepen the study of China's recent modern history, he said with concern: 'In the field of research of nearly 100 years of history, the field of economic history is in a relatively backward state,' which will have negative consequences. To that end, the scholar called for strengthening the study of China's recent and modern economic history. Kong xiangmian Lingren feels very much about this. From the day on the podium, he dedicated his talents and energy to the recently opened garden of China's modern economic history. Compared to other specialized history, teaching and research on economic history requires a lot of information and accurate data, as well as a strong theoretical thinking ability. Boring and esoteric China's recent and modern economic history has discouraged many young students and cast their doors on another side. Kong xiangmian Lingren has attracted students from one year to another with his rich knowledge, interesting language, deep out of the way of teaching. Many students said: 'Teacher Kong xiangmian's penture makes us listen to what would have felt boring and tedious economic history course, actually felt like a pleasure.' Under the strong infection, some students came under her door to engage in teaching and research on China's recent economic history as a pleasure. \\nRigorous learning style, persistent pursuit, Kong xiangmian Lingren has achieved remarkable academic achievements. In the early 1960s, she published 'Several Issues on the Original Accumulation of Capital in China', a profound, unique discussion and attention to academia. Written in the early 80s, such as 'On the Ocean Movement' and others, dared to break through some of the exclusion areas of past research and put forward many new ideas on some extremely sensitive issues, accepted by many scholars, thus promoting the study of the history of the ocean movement. The article 'Socio-economic and Boxer Movement in Shandong at the end of the nineteenth century' discussed the social background, nature and role of the Boxer movement, and received the attention of Chinese and foreign experts at the International Symposium on the History of Boxer Movement held in 1980. The novel point of view, unique perspective, comprehensive discussion, has been worth over a decade. The article 'The Night' and China's Economy around 1930, was considered by peer experts as 'a good economic history paper and a very good literary book.' In response, Mr. Mao Dun, author of the novel, had written to confirm it. In her article 'Confucius and Sun Yat-sen,' she pointed out that Confucius and Sun Yat-sen were two peaks in the history of Chinese thought before modern times. This view was reproduced by many newspapers at home and abroad, with a strong response. In addition, she has written several papers on 'There are two kinds of anti-imperialist anti-feudal struggles in modern Chinese history', 'An Exposition of Shandong Machine Bureau', 'The Positive Significance of Confucianism to China's Modernization Construction', and participated in the editorial work of books such as 'Selected Materials for the Boxer Investigation' and 'Confucian Archive Selection' \\nEntering the nineties, Kong xiangmian Lingren has achieved more fruitful academic results. In June 1991, her editor-in-chief of nearly one million words, 'Pioneers of Modern Chinese Enterprises' (top and next two volumes), attracted widespread attention from academia. The book selected 110 articles written by many scholars and scholars, involving a representative modern enterprise pioneer up to 120 people, both comprehensive and accurate description of people and scientific in-depth analysis, both objective and fair evaluation and pioneering research, providing readers with a flesh, full An informative history of letters. Moreover, the book, while elaborating on the difficult journey of modern enterprise pioneers and promoting their entrepreneurial spirit, also summarizes a set of valuable management experience left by them in long-term business activities, thus providing a certain historical reference for the country's current economic construction. After studying the book, a group of famous scholars have sent letters to Kong xiangmian Lingren, expressing deep respect for her keen gaze and scientific attitude, after five years, paintings and co-ordination, to complete the project. Half a year later, her editor-in-chief's book 'China Modernization and the Movement of Foreign Affairs' was launched. Based on the rich results of research on the ocean affairs movement in recent years, the book has opened up many new areas and expands new thinking on major issues such as China's early modernization and current reform and opening up. \\nIn the face of many results, some good people think that the old hole lingren pen recuperation. What to expect,No burnout Kong xiangmian Lingren started a new fight。 She editors the National Education Commission's 'Eighth Five-Year Plan' project and 10 volumes of more than 3 million words of 'China's Old One' series. This series includes more than 1,500 long-established Chinese enterprises founded before 1949, including industry, commerce, catering, service, medicine, finance, transportation and cultural and entertainment industries, covering the vast majority of prefecture-level cities and some townships. The book describes the difficult and difficult entrepreneurial history of long-established enterprises, unique business strategies, obvious competitive tips, famous products, not only objectively demonstrates the traditional advantages and pioneering spirit of these enterprises, but also fully affirms their new development and new development since the reform and opening up Contribution, not only excavated many little-known historical materials, enriched the content of China's modern economy, but also summed up Many successful experiences and failures have played the role of promoting the old and serving the new era. This huge project has received the attention of CPPCC Vice Chairmen Gu Mu, Qian Weichang, Su Buqing, Sun Fuling, Wanguoquan, Ma Wanqi, Vice Chairmen of the National People's Congress Chen Muhua, Fei Xiaotong, Lei Jie-Qiong, Wang Guangying and others. They either served as general advisers to the series of books, or gladly poured black inscription. This set of research, information in one, authoritative and permanent history, is now in the end stage, is about to meet with readers. \\nScience is borderless. Kong xiangmian Lingren's academic achievements have long been famous, and overseas research institutions and famous scholars have invited her to lecture. In April 1985, Kong xiangmian Lingren, as a renowned scholar, embarked on the territory of the United States. Under the arrangements of the US-China Academic Exchange Committee, she visited 11 famous cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington and New York. For 110 days in the United States, she had academic exchanges with a large number of world-renowned American Sinologists. At the University of Oregon, she exchanged views with Professor Josephw Eesheriek on the relationship between socioeconomics and the Revolution; at the University of Washington in Seattle, she talked about the ocean movement with her peers including Professor Elizabeth ethperry; and at the University of California, Los Angeles, She and Chinese scholar Prof Zongzhi Huang focused on the aftermath of the Opium War Economic changes in various regions in Shandong; at the University of Michigan, she shared views with Professor AlbertFeuerker on issues such as the industrialization of China in the nineteenth century and the use of Ming Qing archives; and at the University of Pittsburgh she worked with Professor Irwinj Schulman The origin and other problems... learn Confucius quote 'Have friends from afar The American Sinologist and some students from various countries who are interested in traditional Chinese culture, learned that she is the 76th generation of Confucius. Naturally, she would not miss the opportunity to explain Confucius and Confucianism. A South Korean student asked: 'Does China offer Confucianism classes? What is the idea to educate children and students?' A Singaporean female graduate student asked: 'Is there any relationship between the low social status of women in China and Confucius's view that only women and villains are difficult to feed?' Taiwanese students asked: 'Does the mainland print Confucius's book? Is it printed 'Theory'?' ... To this, Kong xiangmian Lingren all responded to their satisfaction. That's how, all the way, all the way, everywhere, echoed applause, she won a reputation for the motherland. She also travelled to Japan, Singapore, the Soviet Union and Hong Kong xiangmian and Macao for academic exchanges. For such a famous scholar, MarQULS in the United States and the World List of People published by the University of Cambridge have long included her name and achievements. In the face of honors, she always said with humility: 'My achievements and honors are not my own. Belonging to every Chinese woman, belongs to all Chinese people.' Includepicture \\http://www.jnzx.gov.cn:8080/count_news.asp? id=208\\\\\\ * MERGEFORMANATINET in that unprecedented, non-inverted 'Cultural Revolution' era, as Confucius descendants of Confucius Confucius, despite the knowledge of Dali, good, dedicated, competent, but still can not get rid of the distant. At the beginning of the campaign, she was inexplicably part of a so-called reactionary organization's 'thought history discussion class', and in fact, she had nothing to do with it, and she still knew nothing about what had been discussed in this purely academic session. \\nIn 1969, all the arts of Shandong University where Kong xiangmian Lingren is located was relocated to Qufu, merged with Qufu Normal University. This time she lived and worked in her hometown for five years. It was the first time she spent so long in her hometown. Here she looks deeply at her hometown, thinking deeply about her ancestors, while in a particular environment she carries the burden and suffering of many outsiders unimaginable. Qufu at that time was the base of the villain 'transformation of three holes' (Kong xiangmianfu, Confucius Temple, Kong xiangmian Lin).

At that time, she was carrying two children alone, both to perform daily teaching and labor tasks and to take care of all household chores. Her parents passed away in the 'anti-right' and 'Cultural Revolution', and by Kong xiangmian Lingren and others quietly buried their ashes in Kong xiangmian Lin, where his predecessors long slept. Her seven brothers and sisters, in addition to the big sister Kong xiangmian Ling and far on the other side of the ocean, the pseudonym 'Xiao Huan' presided over the 'VOA' literary theme. The rest are suffering times in various parts of the continent. Her husband, which was far from a thousand miles away from Qingdao, was beaten as early as possible into the right, and the Cultural Revolution storm that swept the earth made him escape again. This deeply affectionate couple is far away, the clouds block, the two places separated for 20 years, in order to visit Fujun, Kong xiangmian Lingren with two children on the Jiaoji line to travel at least 100 times. \\nPolitical discrimination, spiritual depression, Lawton in life, the hardships of the years did not make Kong xiangmian lingren depressed, she believes: the cloud will finally pass, and history will finally be its own face. It is with this firm belief that she silently cultivates her beloved educational grounds and silently endured the tribulations caused by society. \\nThat tragic era has passed away. The earth is recovering, spring has arrived. \\nIn 1978, her husband transferred from Qingdao to the Department of Economics of Shandong University. Twenty years of cowboy weaving woman's life is over, and both of them cherish the good time that should have come earlier than the wings. During the day, they were busy on the podium, and in the evening they walked side by side on campus. At the end of 1994 the first 'National Ten Sapphire Wedding Couples' selection, this pair of loving couples was among them. In line with the beauty of family life, unwittingly, Kong xiangmian Lingren's social responsibility on his shoulder has increased. In 1983, she was elected Vice Chairman of the Shandong CPPCC. To date, she is Shandong's only three consecutive vice-chairman of the CPPCC. After that, she was elected vice-president of Confucius Foundation, vice-chairman of the NLD Central Committee, Standing Committee of the CPPCC and vice president of the All-China Women's Federation. As social status increases, her sense of social responsibility has increased. \\nSince entering the CPPCC, Kong xiangmian Lingren has maintained the character of the people's teachers. Back in April 1983 at the first session of the fifth session of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), she made proposals on the reform of university education: 'First, break the system of ownership of the talent unit and introduce talent mobility in order to realize the full potential of talents. Second, the student's knowledge is too narrow. Arts students should take one or two natural sciences; science and engineering students should take one or two social sciences. It is desirable that all universities offer courses on modern Chinese history to strengthen patriotism education and enrich students' historical knowledge. Third, change the distribution system, which is now entirely State-wrapped, and mobilizes the consciousness of students' learning. Fourth, do not set up universities into a small society, all-encompassing. Big and complete, small and none adapted to the needs of modern construction.' The Popular Daily publishes her forward thinking in a prominent position. At many important conferences, she called on many occasions to raise the fundamental importance of education, increase investment in education, improve the working and living environment of teachers, and to select and re-use young teachers for the development of cross-century talents. It was gratifying to note that her recommendations had been taken into account by the relevant departments and had been gradually implemented and improved in practice. She herself taught her postgraduate students and undergraduates in personality, carefully trained in her studies, and provided a mother-like care and care in life. \\nAs a friend of the Communist Party, democratic parties play an irreplaceable role in discussing national events and participating in political affairs. Elected NLD Central Vice-President shortly. Kong xiangmian Lingren spoke on the multi-party cooperation system led by the Communist Party of China on the theme of 'mutual sincerity, Tancheng meet' and expressed his sincere support for the sixteenth word policy advocated by the Communist Party of 'long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, good care, honor and affront to the Communist Party'. In the process of participating in state affairs, the sense of responsibility and mission of CPPCC members encouraged her to speak for the people, share concerns and give advice to the nation. For more than a decade, she has always adjusted the schedule of teaching and research, making every effort to squeeze out time to attend consultative meetings, take part in field visits, learn about the actual situation, and put forward many relevant and constructive ideas and proposals by writing articles, writing proposals, making statements, talking about ideas and other ways. The vast majority of them are adopted at all levels of decision-making. In previous years, as leaders in individual localities attached great importance to democratic political construction, she had frankly embraced 'not to say nothing, say nothing'. Later, on the basis of her proposals, she had mostly responded positively to the reality, and made a statement in good faith at the CPPCC meeting. The People's Daily and other newspapers have published her opinions, and have had a strong reaction among the readers, especially among members of the CPPCC at all levels. More recently, she also discussed political participation at the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), centered around mastering theory Understand the actual, master the principles and other aspects. Some constructive proposals were put forward and published in the People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Her proposal for the establishment of the Confucius Culture Institute was adopted, and the central and local departments allocated funds to create it. \\nAs a knowledgeable woman, Kong xiangmian Lingren, after assuming the leadership of the All-China Women's Federation, feels that there is still a lot of in-depth work to be done in order to achieve the true emancipation of women. To that end, she drafted a speech at the Second Session of the Eighth Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), on 'Emphasis on the Selection and Use of Women Cadres', which was unanimously commended. In her view, to build socialism with Chinese characteristics, women's participation in politics is the big trend; for the country, government and society, it is first to raise people's ideological awareness and further eliminate old ideas that men are inferior; for women, they should be self-esteem, self-esteem, self-reliance, self-reliance and self-improvement. Qualities, abilities and levels of sub-equal competition. Several newspapers, including the People's Daily, r"},

During the visit, the delegation was accommodated in the State Guest House and received a high degree of courtesy. They exchanged views and information with the deputy presidents of the two countries on bilateral economic cooperation, trade exchanges, the situation of women in both countries and their preparations for the Fourth World Conference on Women. As head of the delegation, she received high praise for her vast knowledge, insightful insights and decent behavior. National television stations in the two countries reported their whereabouts continuously. At the UN Fourth World Conference on Women held in September 1995, she wrote a statement for the NGO Forum of the General Assembly on 'The Great Contribution of Chinese Women', which showed the good style of Chinese women from different sides and helped to enhance mutual understanding. The Chinese Organizing Committee of the World Women's Association issued a 'Certificate of Recognition' to her as a result of 'making significant achievements'. \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"}

On weekdays, they spread a lot of reactionary fallacy. This time again, taking the opportunity of the Party, systematically and viciously launched a comprehensive attack against the party, and the democratic rule of law of the people was a focus of their attack. This article is a slightly abridged by the book's editors, compiled by the classroom based on their speeches. \\n(i), Legislative aspects\\n1. Lack of legislation\\nKong zhao Zhao said, 'It was difficult for us to do a complete set of things in the early days of the founding of the country, but it has been more than three years since the constitution was enacted, and the legislative work has been stalled. He added that these laws, such as the people and the criminal laws, which concern the fundamental interests of the people, began to draft the Penal Code in 1953, have not been prepared for four years. 'We should weigh the interests, have great legal interests, or no legal damage.' \\n2. can not be relied upon\\nKong zhao Zhao said, 'We can't rely on it now. It's hard to wonder that the judges are very heavy,' he said. Huang Shouli also believes that 'Peng Zhen said that the trial work is 'based on facts, the law is the normal', and we have no law, and this is empty words. Now, except the Constitution, there is no criminal, civil code, criminal code or civil procedure code.' \\n3. Lack of central importance to legislative work\\nHuang Shouli said that 'the central government attaches great importance to the rule of law, and in fact, very little attention is paid to it. Attention is given to the campaign and less attention to the regular rule of law work. Criminal legislation work is discouraged.' He said that legislation was so slow and related to several guiding ideas at the central level. First of all, 'the Central Government believes that there is no law that can act in accordance with policy. 'This is correct in the early days of liberation, but it is not enough to pay attention to the law,' he said. Secondly, 'the Central Committee is afraid to enact early laws to restrain their hands and feet. In fact, it is necessary to restrain cadres by law to prevent them from breaking the law. There is a law that restricts arbitrariness. Therefore, the central government fears that the law is inherently contrary to the rule of law,' he said. In addition, he said: 'Some work in the Party Central Committee has replaced legislative work. For example, the ten-member group of the Communist Party of China (CPC), has proposed a standard for dealing with the counter-revolution, and the courts use it as a basis for judgment, but this work should be made public by the NPC Standing Committee and should not be limited to internal control. Zhu Huarong believes that 'the central government attaches great importance to the rule of law is not enough. Judging from the overall legal situation, it is quite lagging behind the real needs.' He said: 'From the trial, everyone has felt the need for law since the examination of the wrong case. The reason for this is the lack of attention given to the legal work and the failure to push this work forward,' he said. \\n4. Guiding principles of legislation\\nKong zhao Zhao said: 'Most of the provisions of our draft penal code are a replica of the KMT law. They are not summed up from reality at all, and the legislative work is greatly lagging behind the development of reality.' 'Our legislative work does not necessarily come from the summary, some have not been elevated to law, and it is correct to summarize the experience of the masses in the campaign to legislate, but some crimes, such as homicide and theft, will be difficult to generate in the big movement, and expand these local experiences, this is insufficient legislation. Excuses before. The crime of adultery has been summed up for years, but has never met the masses in legal form.' \\n'Some people believe that law can only be produced in movement is limited and cannot be extended to the whole legislature,' Zhu said. Some argue that it is not realistic that laws follow reality and that they can only be enacted if experience is mature. The law should come ahead of reality and guide practice, as was the Constitution. Legislation should be foreseeable, such as lessons learned, many things are dealt with without law, and experience has matured legislation, and things no longer exist. Some people believe that once the law provides, even if things are settled, the situation will develop away from the actual reality and restrain the hands and feet of the masses. This view is one-sided, they do not understand that laws can be amended at any time. In fact, due to the absence of laws, many mistakes have occurred, and in order to better combat crime, the timely enactment of the law will have a good effect.' \\n5. Contradictory legislation\\nHuang Shouli said: 'China's single-line regulations are not uniform. Each department makes a single line of regulations each other, and they play each other's mouth, lack of uniform codification and audit.' It was also stated that 'some laws were outdated and not amended in time. Such as the Marriage Act XIX.' \\n6. Directions of the central heads on legislative work\\nHuang Shouli said: 'Dong Lao quoted Tang Law as an example that has been published for decades to shirk our responsibility for legislative delays. However, he did not know that he had used Sui Law before the announcement of Tang Law. After the victory of the revolution, the Soviet Union also allowed the use of some old laws, it is clear that they are all legally based, so we can no longer postpone legislation.' \\n(ii), Judicial aspects\\n1. Low level of judicial cadre and weak views on the rule of law\\nKong zhao said: 'Judges' current thoughts are contradictory. On the one hand, they urgently demand the law, which is good for their own case. On the other hand, there is also fear of having laws, because there are laws that cannot be arbitrary and are not very accustomed.' 'It can be seen from the comments made by the actual departments on the sentence of the draft penal code, many demand to increase the sentence, too much flexibility in legal requirements, is also a manifestation of the weak idea of the rule of law. There are laws that mainly bind the members of the judiciary and will not bind the masses.' \\nHuang said: 'The country is poorly equipped with judicial cadres. It is said that county court presidents are limited to level 16, and then moved away again. This makes people feel that the lower courts are unsupported. Many of the judges will not even write their judgments. And do not think it is a drawback, anti-above pride.' 'Capitalist countries have high demands on judicial personnel. Judges in the Kuomintang grass-roots courts are almost all university graduates, but we do not have a few college graduates. In order to improve the quality of judges and prosecutors, we should be university graduates, and we are 'upside down', who graduates from Shanghai Law College as adjudicators, and university law graduates are clerks.' \\nZhu said, 'Judiciary cadres have heard that Chairman Mao said that judicial work should be the work of experts. In fact, it is not an expert. It will not even write judgments. It's only that political conditions are good, have good ingredients, and have some experience in struggles. These alone cannot be in the interests of the people.' He therefore suggested that 'it is necessary to raise the level of cadres. The training of cadres should be planned, the law department can carry out this task, and the judiciary should be trained to improve their operations on a rotating basis.' \\nKong zhao said: 'The level of judicial cadre is very low. Graduation of students should enrich the grassroots in large numbers. Some have experience, some have no experience, exercise for a year and a half load will also be higher than the current level of judicial cadres. Graduates in the future should enrich the grassroots, which can avoid mistakes.' \\n2. There are many mistakes and trials mess\\nHuang said: 'There are many wrong cases, not 1--2%, but 10-20%, making people break down their homes, this is an intolerable phenomenon.' He also said, 'A large number of people who have been sentenced to a few years' imprisonment without reaching his hand into the pockets of others; cadres who violate the law and discipline, combat revenge and force death have reviewed the matter.' \\nZhu said, 'It is not right that someone is satisfied with more than 90% of the correct cases and ignore the number of wrong cases. A wrong case is 100 per cent error for the parties. The evaluation of the trial work cannot be calculated from the average number of cases'. 'Chengdu prisons are in a lot of people, they cannot be delegated, and they are full in a few days.' \\n3. blame the central\\n'Lu Mingjian said not to think of the law as a universal thing. This is actually not the law,' Kong zhao said. Lu Mingjian gave an example of the unilateral emphasis on the outcome of the law, which prevented many judicial staff from prosecuting crimes. I don't think it's a result of doing it in accordance with the law, but an unjustifiable result.' 'We have a different understanding of 'emphasizing the rule of law, and not letting the law restraint in their hands'. Some people believe that the law is in their own favour, otherwise it can go beyond the legal circle, which is actually synonymous with the destruction of the law.' \\n'The Central Committee often mentioned that we have no experience, so mistakes are inevitable,' Huang said. This is true to some extent, but it is an unforgivable mistake to apply to the administration of justice. The administration of justice should require 100 per cent correctness, and mistakes can lead to the death of a family. Under the guidance of this kind of thought, the cadres below produced the idea of 'rather not right'. This should be blamed for the Central Committee.' \\n(iii), Law's monotheistic work and education work\\nHuang said: 'The goals and specifications of the law department are not clear. They have graduated eight years, but how many people are engaged in judicial work? Some are involved in administrative work, some have backlogs in schools and very little decentralized.' 'Cultivating law students have dogmatic problems and hard moving Soviet experience. Some waste classmates, such as curriculum settings. The stagnation of the scientific research work of the Faculty of Law and the delay in the establishment of the Institute of Law is inseparable from the lack of attention paid by the central government to this work.' Insufficient legal ideology education is also an important issue. Some believe that as long as party discipline is respected, it is not important to comply with the law. In fact, there is a 'gaogan' thing.' \\nZhu said: 'Legal scientific research efforts emphasize contact with reality, but many materials that should not be kept confidential are kept confidential. The United States publishes crime figures every year, and we believe it is partially correct. Bourgeois states dare to expose, why do we not dare to publish crime figures? Of course this may be used by the bourgeois state for counter-propaganda. Is it not afraid of our anti-propaganda? 'We do not dare criminal figures, and this is a violation of the communist declaration, because Marx said that it is a shame for the Communist Party to conceal its policies.' \\n(iv), Town Counterwork\\n1. town anti-killing too much\\nHuang said: 'Town has killed 770,000 people too many people. It has not killed so many people in history, and there are mistakes. For example, at the time of land reform, some had killed a prime minister who had no evil in order to launch the masses. If Chairman Mao proposed a 'stabbing' system early, he could kill many fewer people. Of course, you (refer to the party), to kill 1 million can also be done, whatever you say, pending future history conclusions.' \\nZhu said: 'The town is killing like a lot of people. Corpses are everywhere in the prison. After burying their hair, they accidentally set foot.' \\n2. for Hu Feng shouting 'wrong'\\nHuang said that Hu Feng's literary route of the opposition party says he is counter-revolutionary. However, according to the 'three batches of materials' it is impossible to identify him as counter-revolutionary. As for his 300,000 words, the Opinion is directed against Zhou Yang, so only if you can prove that Zhou Yang is not mistaken, Hu Feng can explain that Hu Feng was wrong.' 'If Hu Feng is a counter-revolution, why is it still not judged? Don't dare see people yet? Is he investigating his connection with Chiang Kai-shek?' \\n(v), In criminal law science\\n1. Criminal law does not use class\\n'Class is spoken everywhere, too vulgar,' Kong zhao said. 'Class talk, empty, do not solve specific problems.' It was also stated that: 'In the context of the sub-rules of criminal law, the significance of combating crime should be as little as possible and more about the composition of the crime.' \\n2. Soviet criminal law science nothing, old criminal law science is good\\nHuang said: 'All things in the Soviet Union were copied from the old laws, some in the Soviet Union and the old laws. The old law, the Soviet Union did not necessarily have.' He also said: 'The Soviet Penal Code gives me positions and opinions, and the old law gives me independent thinking.' \\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attachment 2】Kong zhao Zhao: 'Renmin's University sectarianism most serious'\\nPeople's University sectarianism is the most serious. In the past, there were two factions of the National People's Congress, including Yang Huanan, Hu Xikui, and the Chinese University, the former were guerrilla, and the latter were mostly intellectuals. \\nSome people say that Peking University and other schools like organs, I say that my school like military barracks, have an order on the upper side, follow it down, do not move the brain, there is no little academic discussion style, far worse than Peking University, and schools often take much pride in party members. In fact, this does not indicate any problem. Measuring classmates are mainly the water of his business knowledge. Ping, and many of them are not trained by our school. \\nSome outside people think of the People's Congress as a training class, training people with high political levels of primary school graduation. It is worth considering how outsiders value our school, so I am worried about the future of our school. If enrolled alone, whether it can be filled, there is doubt. \\nSome people say that the NPC is a dogmist big honeycomb. There is a part of the truth. Students graduating from the People's Congress often move out of the handouts of the NPC to stab some old professors. \\nStudents do not think independently. Teachers do not think independently. After the central government proposed a hundred contests last year, our school has been silent for several months. A pool of dead water seems to have no problem in our school. I said that three party members in the city teach monopoly academics, and are intrigued. \\nNo academic air is related to leaders who don't understand business. The leader will only order, fill in the form. For example, no matter what form, it should always be filled in front: gender, age, teaching experience, political profile, etc. Do not understand business leadership is to commit subjectivity. Scare people with politics. If it does not change, continue, the future of the People's Congress is not bright. \\nSome people outside the school indicated that the People's University had privileges, for example, a dean of a college of finance and economics was a non-party member and could not attend the People's Bank business meeting, while an assistant from the NPC could go. \\nMany of the graduated students did not feel good at the NPC, but the leaders were masturbating by 'cultivating red experts'. \\nThere are problems with school cadres policy. Many of the faculty directors of Peking University are foreign students, but what is the director of our school's teaching department? Is the school director a party member to be an administrative officer? Or as an academic leader? How can Liu Guoxun lead science? In order to develop science, these leaders must be replaced, otherwise the three hazards will not be eradicated. \\nI do not understand the university's policy of opening doors to workers and farmers; some of the semi-illiterates brought in 50 years have to be remedied, and they won't work for a few years. It is understood that many people in the preparatory school last year were five points, but the textbooks used were in the fourth grade of primary school. In this way, there were problems coming out to university. It was also heard that 200 people who graduated from the rapid secondary school of workers and farmers this year would be directly promoted to the People's Congress. I suggest that we should consider carefully and consider the level. [Selected right-wing speech in higher schools (Committee of Renmin University of China, August 1958)]\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 5"}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】Han guanqing Kaili: 'Institutional Corruption in Chinese Universities'\\nThis article is an interview with Han guanqing Kaili. Han guanqing Kaili, born in 1945, Professor, School of Economics and Management, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Ph.D. Former Manager of Strategic Technology Evaluation Department of US-Pacific Bell, Special Adviser to China Satellite Communications Corporation; Deputy Director of the Economic and Technological Development Research Center of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications; Adviser on Telecommunication Policy and Development Strategy at the World Bank; member of the Advisory Committee of Experts on the Drafting of Telecommunications Law, known as 'Cannons in the Telecommunications Industry'. \\nHis father, Han guanqing Guanqing, left the United States of America in 1950 to return to a poor and backward China. He published 'I am there there' in the US newspaper. The subtitle is 'Why I want to return to China'. After returning home, the Beijing Institute for Tuberculosis Prevention and Control was established with the support of relevant parties and served as director. In 1957, because of the logic that you have bourgeoisie education, you must be reactionary, and you cannot love the party to love the people; and you returned to China precisely on the eve of the war against US aid to North Korea, so it is probably an American agent-and formed into the right. \\nHan guanqing Kaili is his father's good son, is the second generation of the right. \\nGLOBAL Outlook: We know that you have educational experience at the best universities at home and abroad. First, we would like to ask you to talk about your personal education experience and how these experiences affect you personally. \\nKAN KALI: It is true that I have been studying at the best schools in China, not only after studying in Tsinghua, but I went to Stanford University in the United States. From the beginning of elementary school, I studied the Beijing Experimental Second Elementary School, the secondary school was Beijing IV secondary school in six years. In 1964, the radio department of Tsinghua University was admitted to the radio department of Tsinghua University in 1964. \\nOur schools at that time, especially primary and secondary schools, did nurture students' desire for truth, and I think that was the core value of quality education. Now, school education is too successful. Why is it going to primary school? In order to take a better secondary school, why is it? In order to get to a good university, for what? For future studies, then go out to find a job that earns more money, or a job of iron rice bowl. This learning goal, which is extremely harmful in itself, is to turn learning into a means of achieving merit. The burden of schooling also burdens students tired, natural desire for knowledge and fun of learning are fundamentally destroyed, and the core of education is broken. \\nChildren are born with a desire for curiosity and knowledge about the world, and learning will not be a burden in itself, but a pleasure as long as they are good at guiding. Learned something new every day, previously did not understand, this itself is a great sense of achievement. Even sometimes, things in class do not quench thirst, but naturally go to the library, or go online for further answers. At that time, we often had to do some small experiments at home, like a biology class, raise a few silkworm in our own home, or observe ants in the yard; for physics classes, learn the principle of convex lenses, take a magnifying glass, focus under the sun, put the paper out; learn materialism and idealism, too. Why is mentalism wrong to think independently on your own? Through reading, debate, and independent thinking, you can reach a conclusion by thinking through the end. I think these are the most valuable educational experiences. \\nLater, I went to Tsinghua, which was a six-year program. In 1966, I did not finish my second year, I had the Cultural Revolution. In 1978, I resumed the recruitment of postgraduate students, I took the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. As a result, I became the first group of public overseas students after the reform and opening up. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States in 1979, I went to Stanford to read communications technology. \\nMore than 30 years have passed, and the courses that Stanford taught me almost forgot, but left the foundation of telecommunication technology. And then I did telecommunication policy research, at least technically nobody could afford me. But what's more important is Stanford's spiritual culture. \\nIn recent years, I told students at school, what has Stanford left me? Something in the classroom was almost forgotten, but there was something that melted into the blood. One of the most important things I learned at Stanford is that 'Economic efficiency is the only criterion for testing technology.' \\nAs we all know, Stanford University is known as the Alma Mater of Silicon Valley. According to the data, 780 percent of executives of companies large and small in Silicon Valley, especially the founders and CEOs, have graduated from Stanford. Even companies like Google and Yahoo!, founders went out to start a business without graduating from Stanford, turning technology into real productivity and socioeconomic benefits. \\nI was an international student, so from the first day I went abroad, I thought about what to do to return to China. At that time, because we were the first group of overseas students, the Ministry of Education did not know anything about the outside world, and there was no restriction on what we could go out and learn anything. I think that a country as large as China, at that time, only millions of telephones were available across the country. In some places, one unit did not necessarily have a phone call, let alone individuals have a phone at home. And the kind of popularity of telephone calls abroad makes me feel that China has a huge space for development in this area, so I chose to learn telecommunications. So, I think learning serves the needs of society. Later, I switched to regulation in telecommunications and to research on telecommunication policy and reform of telecommunications institutions, serving this social need. To say a big point, such learning is a sense of social responsibility and adaptation to the needs of the development of the times. \\nNow I'm teaching in school, so I know more about what the current students think. Now students are not considering social needs, but what industry makes more money or has iron rice bowls. This is about learning from the point of view of individual utilisation rather than truly understanding and meeting the needs of society, which also leads them to a particularly dying learning, particularly narrower knowledge, and simply unable to adapt to changing social circumstances. \\nGLOBAL Outlook: The common problem of Chinese students today must also be a problem of the education system. What do you think there are systemic problems with education in China? \\nKAN Kaili: I moved from the Telecom Institute to Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2000 to become the first dean of the School of Economics and Management. After taking office, we had a very big debate about who was at school for whom? Is the teacher serving the student, or is the student serving the teacher? In view of the prevailing situation in Chinese universities now, not only do students serve teachers, but even if they think of graduate students, they are still working for teachers! \\nThe professor gets the project, earns money into his pockets, and then assigns the tasks, and lets students do projects for themselves. Some professors start their own company, graduate students go to the professor's company to work, and even punch the card. Some professors did not get their own projects and did not work companies, so what to do? Let the students go to the company part-time and 'rent' the students. The company gave four to five thousand professors a month, and the students only got 4500, and turned into a bag worker. \\nObviously, these teachers are earning student money, and no wonder many graduate students call their professors 'bosses' behind them. These phenomena were unheard of in China's pre-1949 universities, even before the 1980s. The corruption of this society, the corruption of academics and the corruption of universities is simply a mess, and should it be justified! \\nNot to say that students can't earn money from working outside their studies, but to say that students make money to professors, which is absolutely illegal in the West and is unjustifiable. But it has become a common phenomenon in our country, and even the Ministry of Education has made regulations that each professor bring postgraduate students to pay money to the school. What is the reason for that? Because students make money for professors, a portion of the money that professors earn from their students are handed over to the school-this is what the Ministry of Education requires to bring a graduate student to pay thousands of dollars a year. \\nIsn't this kind of Ministry of Education regulation that Hesen prescribes the 'clean silver'? The corrupt officials and officials raided the people in the local area. Not only can the dynasty be able to control, but also to give it to a part of the court. This means that if you do not go to become corrupt officials, you can't afford to pay the bad silver for the peninsula, it is really a mustache logic. \\nBefore 1949, our old Tsinghua, Old Peking University, or Southwest General Assembly, the relationship between professors and students was really sympathetic to his father and son. Teachers are looking forward to the achievement of students, and when they encounter particularly poor students, professors will pay their own salaries to subsidize the students. That was really a well-nurtured, but now a naked monetary interest. Or, a student worked here for a few years at the professor and made enough money for the professor before you graduate, this is an official legal selling education. \\nOf course, there are many illegal selling educational qualifications. How many 'working PhD' is there in China? Many are state-owned veterans and executives. It doesn't matter if the owner of a private enterprise should be educated, but people in the system are not OK, promotion depends on your education. There are a few senior officials who are not PhDs, but you see how many of them have come to class? \\nHow did their PhD come? It's all bought with money, but also with the money of the state. In the name of state-owned enterprises or government departments, they gave professors a few hundred thousand or millions of projects. It doesn't matter if they can't do it. This is hard work! Professor Qian Qian, get some invoices and get reimbursed. In this way, the professor asks other students to take classes, exams, write papers, or simply 'outsource' them out. Now there is a special industrial chain, which is to write papers. The price is not expensive, a few thousand yuan a copy, and a reputation guarantee, not through not charging money. The United States only gave 30,000 PhDs a year, and China now has 560,000 PhD in a year, the world's first. Aren't this a living ghost? Ten and nine are fake! \\nLegal corruption and gray corruption, all doing business selling diploma, this is China. The whole university education, and even the master's and doctoral education of postgraduate students, is that's what it looks like. \\nGLOBAL Outlook: So, have you personally been in school for so many years, have you ever expected from China's educational reform? \\nHan guanqing Kaili: Hard! What is a University? 'Freedom of thought, spirit of independence.' 'College scholars, non-building also, masters too.' \\nI went to the North Post Administration Institute as president in 2000, and was also ambitious at that time. At our inaugural conference, my speech was 'Striving for the establishment of Stanford University in China.' I said that Tsinghua is known to be China's MIT, Peking University called China's Harvard, and we BeiPost will struggle to become China's Stanford. After two months, I wouldn't dare to mention this again. \\nWhen I was the dean, I started discussing in the hospital, 'whether the students serve their teachers or teachers serve their students', and I couldn't talk about it later. It's like we've been talking about whether officials are going to disclose personal property since the 80s. The truth is clear, but now more than two decades have passed, and there is little result. Under the current system, vested interests are difficult to touch, and it has formed a very solid institutional structure. \\nZhu Qingshi, Chancellor of the Southern University of Science, said that China's universities need to reform, the first is to de-administratize, and the second is to achieve university autonomy and professor and manage schools. The current system is not working, and principals are assigned above. If a government cadre was transferred to work, there was no place to place for placement. He added a deputy principal in the school, and then he was waiting to mix up to retirement. \\nIn accordance with our Higher Education Law, the university operates a system of responsibility of principals under the leadership of the Party Committee. What does this mean? My comment is: the leadership is not responsible, responsible does not lead. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, is the principal responsible system, this principal, or is it not up to this responsibility? \\nI agree with Zhu Qingshi, go administrative and teach the school. Deng Xiaoping engaged in the reform of the rural system to contract production to the home, saying that it is just one sentence: 'I believe that farmers will cultivate land.' In the same sense, the government should trust professors to teach, rather than relying on officials of the Ministry of Education, officials from the central government to direct them. Therefore, if we are to hope, the reform of university education must follow the path of deadministration, university autonomy and professorship. \\nNow that our universities are mainly public universities, the government has a duty to pay. Why? Because it is the government's responsibility to train people for society. However, the Government has no right to intervene in all aspects of the school, from administration to academia, even in the era of North Ocean warlords. \\nSince the reform and opening up, some people shouted the slogans of the industrialization of education. But is there any money around the world that relies on education? Education is a social good in itself and is aimed at promoting the development of society. Western famous universities, even many private schools, have absolutely no dividends to shareholders. The boards of private universities are hired social celebrities who represent the public interest, who decide what our approach is and how to best serve the community. \\nNow China's universities have become a system that makes money. School leaders are all officials, at deputy ministerial level and bureaucratic level. In this way, Chinese universities are the goal of two words: one is the right and one is money. Qian Xuesen's 'Question of the Century' is: 'Why are there no masters in Chinese universities?' What masters are cultivated by such a university is simply a tear. Our university has become a pig farm, pig selling money and completely losing the spirit of college. \\nGLOBAL OUTDOCK: So the last question, where do you think the way out of Chinese students? Under the current system, what advice would you give to Chinese students and parents? \\nHan guanqing Kaili: This proposal is really not very good to say, I'm afraid to go out. \\nIn the past, I argued that I should work in China for a few years after studying at primary, secondary and university levels, and then go abroad to study postgraduate students. In this way, you can take China's problems to study abroad, and return to study can be useful. At that time, this could be said to be the case for our generation. However, today's harsh social environment in China and the level of corruption in schools is far greater than in the 1980s. So, I now advocate sending the children out of junior high school in the country. At this time, he has been in contact with China's culture and basic knowledge, and he does not need to accept the torture of the college entrance examination and waste youth. \\nThe bigger problem is that in my country it is now difficult to develop basic morals for children. I had a graduate several years ago, and her child was three or four years old and sent to a kindergarten in full care. It was also a good kindergarten, and it took them a lot of money to send it Monday morning and pick up home on Friday afternoon. But every Monday morning, the child is crying and crying. Once again, the child was holding his mother's leg at the front of the kindergarten, crying and refused to go in. At that time, the kindergarten aunt came out. The child saw the teacher out, suddenly climb up from the ground, wipe the tears, and said to the aunt, 'Teacher, I come, but think of you!' Imagine that parents look next to the heart shocked: our children, such a young age, have learned to say false words and shoot horses! How did he become this? That's because, only then, can he survive in the environment. \\nI also had an early 'sea return' friend, a company in the country for more than 10 years, and was very successful. However, he finally left China with his family. I asked him why, and his answer was: for the children. We're not meant to make the child become famous in the future, he said, even as a cleaner. But let him be a good man, be a happy person. After several years of hard work, we found that this is already difficult in the domestic environment, not even teaching children the truth. Little children grow up in such an environment, it's easy to become two-sided factions. Do not say happy anymore, having a normal mental state is difficult. What to do? There is no way, only to leave. \\nText/Li Lingbin（2017-06-23 Source: Stanford University, USA）\\nKailli/China's first postgraduate students accredited to Stanford University"}

Brief introduction of small group members\\n1, Kuang shaoyi Shaoyi: right-wing, landlord family origin, family members are mostly reactionary Al-Shabaab members. I have always opposed the party after coming to our hospital. He is the leader of the small group 'academic union', and the organizer of the third party. He is the general secretary of the party. \\n2, Wang Kai: right-wing, landlord's family origin, father was a pseudo mayor and deputy officer of the reactionary army, fled to Taiwan before liberation, and graduated from the pseudo-police school, now Taiwan. After working in 1949, I have been concealing family circumstances and opposing with the party after coming to school. I am a major member of the small group 'Learning Alliance' and the Secretary-General of the Third Party. \\n3, Wu Guizhi: right-wing elements, landlord's family origin, came to school to resist the party's education, publicly abused and attacked the party, is an active activist of the small group 'learning alliance'. \\n4, Jia Hongshun: rightists, young students, poor peasant components, have serious individualism and arrogance ideas, blurred positions, closely followed by the right and party opposing. \\n5, Cao Shulan: Young students, staff of family origin, because of the ambiguous position, serious individualism, at the encouragement of right-wing elements Kuang shaoyi Shaoyi and Wang Kai participated in organizing the third party. Under the use and encouragement of Kuang shaoyi, he served as general secretary of the party. \\n6. Fu Chengzhang: The right-wing element, although he did not directly participate in the small group 'academic alliance' and the third party, but he usually has close ties with small group members. In addition to his personal series of anti-party activities, he has always actively supported Kuang shaoyi, Wang, Wu and other anti-party activities. \\nSecond, the organization of the reactionary small group\\nBecause right-wing elements Kuang shaoyi Shaoyi, Wang Kai, and Wu Guizhi are all extremely dissatisfied with the Party, their positions are consistent, and their actions combine each other, and often walk together, drink alcohol and whistle. So gradually formed a small group. In December 1956, three of them decided to form a Philosophical Science Research Group, led by Kuang shaoyi Shao-yi, and Wu Gui-zhi as secretary, and attended by Jia Hongshun. Started to be named 'Allied'. Later because the name 'learunion' was too explicit, it was renamed 'non-Zu Ge Meng'. And decided to keep the secret. Kuang shaoyi feared exposing the problem of the 'academic union', and asked Wang Kai several times, 'Have you told others about our problems?' 'Why should you tell Yang Meili about the science team (Yang is Wang Kai's girlfriend)?' 'You can't tell us about Yin Shuibo (Yin is a support).' etc. \\nTheir secret group appeared as a 'scientific group', ostensible studying philosophical theory and writing articles, but secretly engaged in various anti-party activities. In order to cover up opposition activities, Kuang shaoyi Shao Yi stressed that every meeting had to make false records, and said: 'With such a record, we are not afraid to check.' \\nKuang shaoyi Shaoyi told the purpose of organizing the secret group: 'When I started to set up a scientific group, I wanted to organize a third party. I thought it was good to use this form, and I was prepared to use the scientific group as the sprout of the third party. 'My purpose of organizing the third party is to fight against the party, the party chamber, and thus achieve the purpose of replacing it...' said, 'I have two motivations and purposes for organizing the third party, one is political ambition, and I think that with a political party, having the power to do it well, I can be a leader. The other is that I think socialist society is not a good one, and the form of social development is more than one Short, so socialism will soon finish. At least 200 years, I organized the 'Third Party' to fight for another 'higher social system'.' \\nThe group held five secret meetings from December 1956 to April 1957. The group participated in the group leader Kuang shaoyi Shaoyi and Secretary Wu Gui-zhi, team members Wang Kai and Jia Hongshun. \\nAfter the beginning of the wind, the small group aggressively attacked the party, Kuang shaoyi Shaoyi took the opportunity to formally organize the 'Third Party'. Kuang shaoyi Shaoyi said: 'In the past, I have organized the idea of a third party. Wang Kai told me that people at the People's University had set up a social democracy party. I thought it was very good. One day I went out for a walk with Fu Chengzhang, Wu Guizhi and Wang Kai, and raised the issue of organizing the party.' \\nKuang shaoyi Shaoyi once said to Cao Shulan: 'The wives of the cadres have a lot of wages. We want to prove that the Communist Party has changed. We ourselves organize a political party to fight for communism.' \\nOn a Sunday evening in early June, Kuang shaoyi Shaoyi and Wang Kai and Cao Shulan also talked about the issue that the Communist Party has become spoiled, and they want to organize a party. They also talked about the theoretical basis of the 'party', development targets, party platform and other issues. \\nOn the issue of the name of the 'party', they have studied twice and not finalized; the division of labour is made by General Secretary Cao Ren, General Secretary Kuang shaoyi Dangfu, Secretary-General Wang Kaitang, (Cao Shulan revealed: 'In the division of labor, Kuang shaoyi Shaoyi called me to be general secretary. He said, 'You become general secretary, you have no problem. ''), \\nOn the theoretical basis of the 'party', Kuang shaoyi said they only believe in the dialectic law, which is absolute truth, and other Marxinism is no longer necessarily applicable;\\nOn the subject of development, they intend to develop only university students, first at the university. Then develop outside the school through relationships such as students, lovers and other relationships. Undertake concealed development, until a certain period of time. At that time, Cao Shulan also proposed to develop the most 'brave' and 'upright' college students. \\nIII. Specific activities of small groups\\nIn addition to the five meetings of the small group 'Academy Union' and the organization of a third party during the whole period, they also carried out the following anti-party activities. \\nA), carry out provoking differentiation activities\\n1, provoke the party group relationship isolated party branch: In order to create terror, Kuang shaoyi Shao Yi pointed out that the party has two sets of appraisal system, one is open to themselves, one is not open to themselves. \\n'We are going to oppose the party branch, you speak east, I speak west, isolate you and see what you can do to us.' \\nAfter Du Bingzhi entered the party, Kuang shaoyi used the group support role to actively seek separate talks with classmates, according to Kuang shaoyi himself; 'I found four female classmates to talk, ostensible soliciting their views on Du Bingzhi's party. In fact, this is my plan to provoke my classmates dissatisfaction with the party.' \\nOverseas Chinese student Huang Hanrong's watch was lost. Kuang shaoyi Shaoyi and Wang Kai-bian took the plane to find Huang individual talk, saying that the watch was stolen by × × × (party members), called Huang Note × × × action. \\n2, pulling the middle molecules to combat activists\\nWang Kai said, 'Kuang shaoyi Shaoyi once proposed to take advantage of the economic view of young classmates. It is a strategy, like Fang Liu × has an opinion on the grant.' \\nWang Kai said, 'We say that people close to the Party are all patching horse bengying. It is to create a kind of public opinion and put thought pressure on the classmates. They do not dare to approach the party branch.' \\n3, to seize the team leader and team book leadership\\nWhen he re-elected the class leader, Kuang shaoyi Shaoyi first proposed to want Wang Kaitang team leader in order to capture leadership in their hands and beat Qiu Bailin (regiment books, party members). Kuang shaoyi once said to his classmates, 'Is there no one who does not let Qiu Berlin be the regiment book?' During the wind, they posted a large print newspaper asking for the withdrawal of Qiu Berlin's regiment book. If you want Kuang shaoyi himself to serve as a group book, Kuang shaoyi Shaoyi also said to Wu Gui-zhi: 'After repealing Qiu Berlin, you will resume your post as a propaganda committee. (Wu was a propaganda member of the last regiment).' In this way, they can capture the leadership of the executive corps and isolate the party branch. \\nWhen Wang Kai was elected as the duty chief, Cao Shulan said to people: 'This is our first step victory.' Kuang shaoyi Shaoyi also prepares to want Wang Kai to be the head of the \\n2), Eavesdropping party members' conversations, peek at party documents, exchange information with each other, and study ways to deal with the party\\nKuang shaoyi Shaoyi made use of the Mission's support role, after understanding the work of the Mission branch, he said to the small group personnel: 'The team branch divides the classmates into advanced, middle and backward,' and said to Wang Kai: 'Now if you don't engage him (the delegation's book), he may want to engage you.' \\nAfter organizing the third party, Kuang shaoyi feared the situation was discovered and discussed with Wu Gui-chi about countermeasures. Wu Xianze said: 'If the Party branch does not detect, do not expose it; not to be detected, try to dilute the problem, make big things small, small things.' And on a Sunday evening in mid-June, Wu and Kuang shaoyi two went to the northwest corner of the playground to eavesdropping the party books and Cao Shulan's conversation in an attempt to understand whether the party branch had their knowledge. \\nIt is consistent that Wu Guizhi eavesdropping party members' conversations. He often reflects what he asks about to Hong Kong. Kuang shaoyi also peek at the internal documents of the Party branch. When the party branch criticized the wrong words and deeds of their small group personnel, Kuang shaoyi Shaoyi and Wang Kai said, 'We were bitten by crazy dogs, we want to beat the dog.' \\nThe small group regularly analyzes the situation of classmates in the class, makes political estimates of each individual, researches the objects that seek to get together, such as they believe: 'Fang x x, Yang x have no opinion and do not need to pay much attention; Liu x x is narrow, good temper, and often together with the Party branch committee. Chen × × has some social experience. There is a set of people, to be wary of him; Liu × × ×, Huang × do not express opinions, general youth Students can't count anything; Cao Shulan can fight...'\\n3), Anti-party activities in the process of rectification and anti-right\\nAfter the wind began, the small group aggressively attacked the party. Members of the small group 'Academic Union' wrote a chapter back in the name of the four members of the Communist Youth League and said the big word, titled 'Grassroots party members are wrong, the boss of the branch committee is lawless lawlessness', scolding the Party Committee is 'a very strict Yamen' and scolding the party committee is 'laughing' 'Face Tiger', 'Party branch hung sheep head selling dog meat.' Party branch is 'despicable and shameless, always bullying down, party members are made of a bunch of waste, simply no humanity is some harlequin playing funny drama' and so on. \\nUsing the opportunity of the classmates to give opinions to the party, to gather some classmates for meetings, steal 13 people in the name of the big print: 'Strongly ask for the removal of the party branch office as Yongtai,' 'We do not want such a group book, and abolish Qiu Berlin (Party member), group support duties.' 'To abolish Du Bingzhi (Party member), (which cannot be identified here), as a Bursary Officer.' 'Request to re-examine Du Bingzhi's party membership issue.' And (the words cannot be recognized here), 'Zhang Zhiming should serve as a party branch.' According to Kuang shaoyi Shaoyi frankly said on July 4: 'The withdrawal of the support committee (which cannot be identified by a few words here), to Zhang Qi-ming, is to make a contradiction within the Party branch.' And Wu Gui-zhi publicly said at the time when he posted the big print: 'This is mainly to achieve the purpose of polarization.' \\nWhen the anti-right began, their small group members covered each other, saying, they were not anti-party members against individual parties. When the masses criticized Wang Kai for his anti-party behavior, Kuang shaoyi Shaoyi directly defended: 'We cannot confuse the party and the individual members of the party. Opposing individual party members is not equal to the opposition party.' Wu Guizhi also said: 'Opposing individual party branches cannot be said to be opposed to the whole party.' \\nAfter the first stage of anti-right struggle, small groups have largely broken down.

Some of us here around the party, will flatter horses, in fact, this is not good for the whole wind, you should be humbled, do not just want to listen to good, the masses (referring to her own), just say a word, you will fight back, this is the motivation to combat the masses. (statement at the panel meeting on 24 May)\\n2. The party branch called Chen Shiren (party member), and Gao Xingwu (Party member), two comrades of the production department as leaders of the two teams of the production department. They did not guide the masses very well to speak of their hearts, and they were more or less intentionally and unintentionally repressive (exposing Chen already). Of course, things will get worse and worse. Where do we go for the whole wind movement? I was confused and suggested that the party branch should take urgent measures, not to call the movement suffered a loss (excerpt from the big print, 'Speak to the Party Branch'). \\nII. Perspectives on Communist Party leadership and cadres and activists\\n1. The old cadres of our society who have turned into work have no culture and do not understand technology. It is not appropriate to work in cultural institutions such as publishing houses. In the force, although they are section chiefs and directors, they should now be based on their talents and what they can do (the director can be a team leader), should start with a specific job, and it is not practical to study alone. Through the wind, the society should integrate these. (Presentations at the Proofreading Section group meeting)\\n2. There was an old saying: 'One day a day, a dynasty.' It seems somewhat similar to what is happening today. Why did Minister Wang's Jum enjoy such a superior treatment? It can be seen that the head of the shame is also different. Although the Personnel Section has opinions, but because the introduction is too hard, it has to be the only thing to come from. In this way, President Zeng can say the past in front of Minister Wang. In his heart, Minister Wang would think that 'Zeng President really enough friends' should be the head of a society, actually able to be thoughtful leadership heart. I heard that a small cadre introduced his uncle to work has been rejected. This comrade has very much opinion. Obviously, uncle is not as good as um, the warmth of human love can be known! (Excerpt from Big Print 'Upper beam is not correct, lower beam crook')\\n3. We have made a lot of opinions on the party, whether it is possible to expand the scope of the whole activist, because most activists are members and party training targets, their shortcomings are many. Although they are not members of the party, they will still join the party in the future, this time is not complete, may not be in many years. Whole wind. (Presentations at the Proofreading Section panel)\\n4. In our study group, there actually appeared such people, who specifically refuted the opinions of comrades, considered themselves to be the party's beloved people and stood up to defend the party. Of course, his approach is very clever. He does not mention opinions, and when others have raised opinions, he will lobby with a set of principles. He often takes a long time to influence the speech of the masses. He cannot fail to know that an unprincipled accommodation party is actually harming the Party. His help to the Party like this is really not good for the Party. I think that although the party confused to believe him for a moment, it will be wise through the whole wind movement. Comrades like this are not ugly Out of what is the deep inside of him what color, heartfelt tell him, sober! (Excerpted from The Big Print, 'How To Be')\\nIII. Perspectives on the matrimonial regime\\nAfter the promulgation of the Marriage Law, divorces have become more difficult than before liberation, especially in the countryside. Today many divorces get married tomorrow, making a lot of them bad. Now the girl looking for objects formed the atmosphere of finding a big officer-three members. I think this is a social problem. As there is no formal rule of law in the administration of justice, a bad social culture has been developed.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】Liaoning Health Department Branch of the Communist Party of China: Decision on Expulsion of Right Party Membership, Kuang yuanpeng Yuanpeng (1958.3.11)\\nKuang yuanpeng Yuanpeng, male, 52 years old, family origin broken landlords, my composition students, high school, Han ethnic origin, Hanchuan County, Hubei Province, took part in the work in June 1939, joined the Communist Party in 1926, after the defeat of the revolution, and then rejoined the party in April 1941. Currently Deputy Director of the Department of Health. \\nMy curriculum vitae: 1925 to 1939: Ren Mao Pharmaceutical, Diqian, Chancers; Maintenance Director, from 1939 to 1940 in Yan'an Kang University, from 1940 to 1948 as director of the pharmaceutical workshop, manager of pharmacy, pharmaceutical factory, food department director, health technology factory director and political committee; from 1948 to 1953 as Northeast Ministry of Health Director of Finance, Head of Infrastructure, Director of Finance, Northeast Engineering Manager; current position in May 1957. \\nAfter participating in the revolution for the second time, Kuang yuanpeng performed well and was still able to complete the task. During the resistance war, the self-defense war was doing some work for the Party, and the late performance of the bourgeois thought gradually grew, and in all political movements there were right-leaning ideas. After the self-regulation of the Department of Health, the performance of the Department of Health has been dragged, irresponsible, rarely in depth to study the problem and pursue the bourgeois lifestyle. \\nThe main reactionary words and deeds of Kuang yuanpeng Yuanpeng's anti-socialism\\n1, instigating Wang Xinyi (director of the provincial hospital, secretary of the civil leather branch), for his counter-revolutionary son to turn the case: in May 9, 1957, Kuang yuanpeng to Wang Xin in a conversation with Wang said, '... your son's problem (anti-revolutionaries and rape young girls sentenced, and Kuang yuanpeng is aware beforehand), you always see what problems! Your son is not in control and sue them!' And he further instigated by example, 'My wife's nephew was wronged in the past three times, and I will let them accuse them, and I personally write a son to him.' And said: 'I think the labor team thinks that he has not performed well there, does not progress, does not achieve the purpose of reforming labor.', 'I heard that you always have an opinion on the issue of the organization for the sake of his brother (that is, Wang's son). The organization is very concerned about the issue of the brotherhood. The matter was written in person to the court calling for early release.' When this matter was revealed, Kuang yuanpeng did not listen to the organization's warning, and went again to look for Wang Xinyi and said: 'Today's things are not small things, it is important to my political life. For this matter, I will not be able to participate. In the middle of the climax, anti-right, not to ask you old, as long as you say justice, please You were treated impartially.' He Yufeng and Comrade Song Weiyi (Party member, deputy director of the provincial hospital), reflecting Kuang yuanpeng's material and the inspection materials that the party group ordered Kuang yuanpeng to write were handed over to Wang Xin for a look. \\n2, for his wife, Zhang Guoxian: Zhang Guoxian was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for embezzlement at the time when he was wrong. He personally brought material to the Director of the Procurator's Office for illegal activities, and also appeared before the court for his opinion. After the court's decision was changed to one year, it was still treated as corrupt elements, and Kuang yuanpeng promoted the matter everywhere. \\n3. The right-wing elements attacked the party's anti-opposition policy during the big magnification. At the beginning, Kuang yuanpeng is a member of the leading group for observation. Kuang yuanpeng is a member of the leading group, but actually asked for a speech without permission: 'You are my main clerk in charge of the section, and your speech is wrong. How can we say that, young people are inevitable. Your mind is blurred... you have to admit mistakes, do not have concerns, know you in the organization, the right is organized, planned, planned, planned, and your problem is mostly unstable, vague and unclear.' After this conversation, Fu said, 'I don't have any big deal, the organization knows me'. The delay in the affluence of the rich has hindered the smooth progress of the anti-right struggle. \\nAfter the issue of Kuang yuanpeng was revealed, five party group enlargement meetings were held to inspect and confess, and at the same time criticized, but Kuang yuanpeng's attitude was not honest, sometimes threatened, sometimes pulled, sometimes resisted, and stressed that the motivation was good, repeatedly dragged the time not to account. After the meeting, he also carried out activities, slander said: Long has an opinion on him.' At the mass struggle meeting, Kuang yuanpengshi acknowledged the facts, but still did not admit that its motives were conscious. After the masses put the facts and justifications of the hard criticism, he pleaded guilty only when the truth was strict, the facts were clear, and irresistible. \\nAfter taking part in the revolution for the second time, Kuang yuanpeng Yuanpeng once performed well at work. Later because the pursuit of the bourgeois lifestyle fell to political changes, provoked the counter-revolutionary family to turn the case over the case, waging for the corrupt Zhang Guoxian, and obstructed the smooth progress of the anti-right struggle in the anti-right struggle. \\nAccording to the above facts, Kuang yuanpeng is carrying out anti-party activities against the people in the coat of Communist Party members. So when the right of the bourgeois is attacking the party, Kuang yuanpeng becomes the right of the bourgeois attacking the party. According to this, Kuang yuanpeng is a general right-wing element in the party. The branch assembly unanimously adopted a decision to dismiss its party membership (42 full branch members, 32 participants in the meeting, all passed). \\n'A Compilation of Decisions on Purging Rightists in the Party', Executive Office of the Central Committee of the CPC Central Committee, December 1959\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "(Appendix 2] Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China: Resolution 1958.2.12 on Expulsion from the Party)\\nIn November 1957, the provincial committee held a four-level cadre meeting and after this meeting, the provincial organs propaganda, cultural and educational system party cadres and all party members of Guiyang Normal College revealed the serious mistakes made by the current provincial committee members and the dean of Guiyang Normal University health. According to the information revealed and verified, the mistakes made by health are mainly manifested in the following areas:\\n(1), On major international issues, it has always adhered to the bourgeoisie nationalist position and revisionist views, distorted and defamatory propaganda against the Soviet Union, the anti-revolutionary riots in Hungary in October, the Sino-Soviet relations and relations between the socialist countries. In this propaganda, health and health completely negated the great achievements and advanced experience of the Soviet Union in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, negated the great contribution of the Soviet Union in defending and developing the socialist cause and the cause of peace throughout the world, and distorted political life within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. slandered Soviet foreign policy and Soviet just support for other socialist countries; he put Hungary in October The anti-revolutionary insurgency was described as 'the result of the dogmatic study by Hungarian leaders of the Soviet Union and the Soviet power chauvinism,' saying that 'Naji is right', describes the Chinese people's learning of the advanced experience and achievements of the Soviet Union as 'superstitious Soviet' and the relations between socialist countries as vulgar And provoking propaganda, explanation. Health propaganda on relevant international issues is not conducive to socialist international solidarity and the international solidarity of peace-loving peoples throughout the world, but undermines those solidarity. This propaganda of health is a serious violation of party discipline and has had a bad impact among teachers and students at Guiyang Normal College. \\n(ii), In the 1957 'magnification' and anti-right struggle, sympathize with and support the reactionary rhetoric of the right and encourage right-wing groups to attack the party. In 'Zoom on Ming', Kang jian spoke on the 'trification' (aimed at stigmatizing party members and activists), written by Zhang Ruzhou, a right-wing member of Guiyang Normal College, Zhu Houkun, etc., at the provincial committee publicity work meeting and teachers' symposium (aimed at attacking the Party's intellectual-policy, knowledge), The reformation of the ideas of the molecule and the 'three anti' and 'anti-counter' movements), Wang Shengfu posted a large print (aimed at stigmatizing (The main comrade in charge of the provincial committee), for the fallacy put forward by some right-wing elements in the Wenhui Bulo that 'the Party Committee should withdraw from higher schools' and 'professors to manage schools', all considered 'very reasonable' and greatly praised. After the anti-right struggle at Guiyang Normal College is about to begin and health has learned about the spirit of the anti-right struggle, the right elements of the students, Nazhiliang and Liu Zhixiang, have initiated the establishment of an 'Inspiring Committee for Improving the Political Status and Material Treatment of Teachers' in the Institute, in an attempt to create the current teachers 'too low' and 'indifferent' public opinion on political status and economic treatment, inciting teachers and students, and even the whole Provincial and national school teachers rose up to 'big democracy' in order to carry out their anti-party and anti-socialist conspiracy; for the conspiracy of this right-wing group, health not only sympathizes with their reactionary rhetoric, but also actively contributes to them and supports and sponsors their actions. Both before and after the inception of this reactionary organization, Health has published sympathy and support conversations. At the school's student representative meeting on June 3, the right-wing elements Nazhiliang, Zeng Qiang and others raised an appeal to society for the issue of the political status and material treatment of teachers, and their health immediately applauded and urged them to quickly adopt the Appeal; when the meeting adopted the Appeal, they raised their hands in high health., Applause. Following the adoption of the Appeal, the reactionary arguments in the Health Think Book were insufficient, instructing right-wing elements to collect 'concrete and compelling material' to be supplemented by the provincial education union (health chair), and instructed the College Office to support funding to bring the Appeal The book, 'Hundreds of copies sent out' (in fact, 300 copies have been distributed throughout the country), in order to expand social outreach. After the anti-right struggle started at Guiyang Normal University, health and many aspects exonerated some right-wing elements in the institute, arguing that party members and activists 'put the red flag too high'; some right-wing elements were criticized by the masses, and he hurried to shake hands and compensate for crime, saying, 'You have been frightened for this month and a half.' It turns out that, in the fight against the right, health has completely lost the position of a Communist Party member and coincided with the right-wing elements. Health is not only an active supporter and advocate, but also an actual participant, for the right-wing group of the Committee for Enlightenment of Political Status and Material Treatment of Teachers. This rebellious act of health has caused serious damage to the authority of the Party at Guiyang Normal College. \\n(3), Unorganized, resist leadership, brag about individuals, fight comrades and treat Guiyang Normal College as his personal 'independent kingdom'. Since 1952 as president of Guiyang Normal University, he has always held a resistance to the leadership of the provincial committee, provincial committee propaganda department and ministry of culture and education, using 'top back' and 'hold the door' methods, so that certain important instructions of the Provincial Committee cannot be implemented in Guiyang Normal College. He often expressed his reluctance to attend the meetings convened by the provincial committee, believing that participation in the meetings of the provincial committee delayed his teaching and learning of science. He has consistently adopted arrogance and confrontation at meetings convened by the Ministry of Culture and Education of the Provincial Committee. After the establishment of the Party Committee of Guiyang Normal University, even after the Eighth Party Congress passed the new Party Charter, Health still insists on implementing the 'one-long system' on the leadership of the work of the college. Many important issues are not discussed by the Party Committee, i.e., by individuals decide and announce to exclude the Party Committee. Unified leadership and supervision for the work of the College. In a healthy mind, the party committee is only his personal affiliation; he openly said to comrades of other higher schools: 'The party committee meets, you agree with me, this is the party committee system; you do not agree with me, I will do it according to the old law, or a long system.' On all occasions, health always boasted itself, trying to create personal worship among the masses. He had decided to make June 12, when he entered the college and started rethinking of its teachers, to occupy himself as the founders of the Academy; and even allowed and praised among the masses for his great stay with Chairman Mao, which was posted in the hospital's poster on the hospital's poster. A portrait and sing to his verses. Health and Health has consistently taken an attitude of exclusion and blow to some of the older Party members and cadres who work at Guiyang Normal College, saying that they 'don't understand pretend', 'are outdated', 'to be eliminated'. They cannot build socialism and run higher schools, saying that they work there is a 'backpacking'. 'Poking holes', satirical, abusive and hitting them, making it difficult for them to work and want to put them a One place to get out. In order to combat the old cadres, he even used harsh means of drawing up a group and combating a group of people. To some comrades in charge of the provincial committee and the responsible comrades of the Provincial Committee's Ministry of Culture and Education, they constantly spread some rumors and rumors; he even deliberately created public opinion within the party in an attempt to bring down the responsible comrades of the Provincial Committee's Ministry of Culture and Education. The bad attitude of healthy treatment of organizations and comrades is a reflection of his extremist individualistic thinking of the bourgeois. His misdeeds seriously violate the party's principles of organization and undermine the unity of the party. \\n(4), In practice, there has been a consistent distortion of the Party's policies and policies, and manifests itself as a serious right-wing opportunity. In the work of intellectuals, health distorts the approach of solidarity, education and transformation, underlining the solidarity side in a one-sided and isolated manner, while ignoring and abandoning the aspect of education and transformation. In the opinion of health, intellectuals have been transformed, no longer need to be reformed. He thinks that intellectuals have always been 'unable to eat', and now it is time for 'intellectuals to come to power' and 'workers and farmers to step down.' He thinks intellectuals 'have learning', and then reforming, will hurt their self-esteem. As a result, health is always good for intellectuals, and rarely criticizes and helps them. In the work of intellectuals and cadres, he always emphasizes only operational competence, regardless of political quality. His direction to students is to move away from actual and political direction; the path he takes is actually the path of 'teaching the school.' In the 'fight against' work, especially in the late part of this work, health became a surrender, and it was totally wrong to 'counteract'. Health always holds a skeptical attitude towards the Party's policies and policies, and exaggerates certain shortcomings in actual work, and distorts the Party's policies and policies. He always looked at party documents and newspapers from the opposite side and did not believe in party calls and instructions. He distorted the 'three anti' movements, ideological reform movements and the Party's rectification movements, and negated the achievements of these movements. Here, a healthy anti-party, anti-socialist stance was fully exposed. \\nBased on the above facts, the Provincial Plenary considers that the health error is extremely serious: he has betrayed the party's principles ideologically, politically and organizationally, betrayed Marx, Leninism, and the proletarian revolutionary cause, and became an anti-socialist bourgeois right. In order to clean the organization of the Party and the serious discipline of the Party, the Provincial Committee of the Provincial Committee decided to abolish the healthy provincial committee members and his other posts in the party and remove healthy party membership; and recommended that the concerned parties abolish all healthy administrative posts. \\nThe Provincial Committee of the Plenary of the Provincial Committee believes that the position, views and his ideological style on all the above issues are the reflection of the bourgeois class essence. Health so it is not accidental to fall into the right. Being born from the family of bullies landlords, has personally participated in the exploitation of landlords, and has long been educated by the bourgeois and imperialist slavery education, becoming a bourgeois intellectuals. Before the War of Resistance against Japan, health was politically speculative in order to defend its class interests, once joined the KMT, and later joined the KMT's reformed faction. By the outbreak of the anti-Japanese war and the rise of the popular rescue movement, he was mixed with the Communist Party with the idea of political speculation. According to health and health himself, when he joined the Communist Party, he was skeptical about the party, believing that the party did not believe in intellectuals and brought 'class dissent' into the party. As a result, health, when joining the party, brought two characteristics from his origins and history: the bourgeoisie ideology remains intact, and political speculation. After joining the party, Health has experienced 20 years of revolutionary struggle. In the long revolutionary struggle, health must not fail to expose his class nature, causing a serious struggle between the party organizations and his misconceptions. Historically, the most prominent problem of health is his self-interest, bullying and oppressive ideological style. In order to fight his bad style, the party organizations have focused on him in the various winds and all-party movements, seriously criticized and educated him. However, whenever this is the case, health always refuses to receive party education by using false reviews and mixed past methods, and the reactionary position of the healthy bourgeois has always remained unchanged, only because he sometimes shields it in the form of 'left', sometimes disguised it with Marxist-Leninist words. The main thing is to confuse it with his speculative two sides, so that it has not been exposed for a long period of time. Its true face. It was until the Chinese revolution entered the current stage of the socialist revolution, when international and domestic cattle gods attacked the revolution together, the healthy anti-party and anti-socialist positions and views were fully exposed. Thus, health is an untouched bourgeois, a class dissidents and political speculators who have long been hidden within the party. Guizhou's party organizations exposed him from the party's leadership bodies and is the victory of the Guizhou Party in the whole wind movement. \\nThe Provincial Committee is of the view that party members throughout the province, especially members of intellectuals, should learn from the mistakes made by health:\\n(), Health is a 20-year party member. Because he insists on his reactionary position of bourgeois, refusing the party's education and transformation, finally embarked on the road of anti-party and anti-socialism, becoming a right-wing element. This shows that a Bourgeois intellectual-born party member must go through long and severe class struggles in order to get a radical transformation of his mind and a fundamental change of position. Ideological transformation depends on the education of the Party and the education of the masses, but the most effective is its own consciousness; the education of the Party and the masses will only work through the consciousness of one person. To transform ideas, they must be honest, and they cannot be false at all; whoever wants to be false will deceive himself. For 20 years of joining the party, the party cannot say less about his education, and because he has no such consciousness and has always made false falsifications, his bourgeois reactionary stance remains untouched and cannot stand the serious test of class struggle. Within our party, the idea of the bourgeois is incompatible with that of the proletariat; to be a true communist member, the bourgeoisie's minds must be cleared. After the system of exploitation had basically been eliminated, all sorts of bourgeoisie thought became the enemy of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and the most prominent manifestation of bourgeoisie thought among intellectuals was individualism of all kinds. In our party, many comrades are intellectuals. For intellectual-born party members, special vigilance should be given to the idea of bourgeoisie individualism, otherwise they will also embark on a healthy path. \\n(ii), Our fight against health mistakes is a two-way struggle on the front of political theory and the struggle to defend Marxism and anti-Marxism. The healthy conduct of anti-party and anti-socialist activities always cloaked the coat of Marxism. It now seems that the position and views of health on some major international and domestic political issues prove that he has always been a revisionist. But for a long time, people were confused by his cloak, until the critical juncture of the socialist revolution, where we went through anti-right struggles and increased political vigilance before exposing him from his coat. It is clear here that our fight against the enemies of anti-socialism on the political front must simultaneously fight all revisionists on the theoretical front. If we are to win the two-way struggle on the political and theoretical fronts, we must tightly grasp the revolutionary theory of Marxism and Leninism. We must step up theoretical learning, improve our theoretical level and identify against me, wrong and authenticity on the theoretical front. Any revisionist view is anti-Marxist and anti-socialist, and we must fight them resolutely. \\n(3), From the health mistakes, an unreformed bourgeois intellectuals always oppose the party's principles of organization with extremist individualism: individual prominence against the collective leadership of the party, with decentralization against the unity of the party, and liberalism with Party discipline The confrontation, even by sectarian activity, the organization of the separatist party, confrontation with the unity of the party. The confrontation between individuals and organizations, requiring organizations to obey individuals, or as long as individuals and not to organize, is a manifestation of the instinct of bourgeoisie individualism, which aims to create organizational chaos and weaken the role of the organization in order to realize individual ambitions. The principle of collective leadership of the party, the principle of democratic centralization, individual obedience to the organization, subordinate subordinate, and the whole party obey the central government are important principles that maintain the unity and unity of the party from the organizational standpoint. Without these important organizational principles, the Party cannot have unity and unity, and it will not matter the party organization. The party loses everything and completely lost its combat power. For this reason, the enemies of the party always try to conspire to destroy our party's cause from our party's organization, and the idea of bourgeois individualism within the party is the basis for the enemy, which is to say: to preserve the party's principle of organization, is to preserve the life of the party; we must cooperate with those who violate The party's principles of organization and violations of the Party's discipline are engaged in a resolute and serious struggle. \\nThe Provincial Committee of the Plenary believes that the issue of health has educational significance for the whole party, and the resolution is communicated among all party members. Healthy misconceptions have had an impact in higher education schools, and the Provincial Committee's Plenary called on the party organizations of higher schools to take measures within and outside the party to completely eliminate the influence of such misconceptions. \\nAdopted unanimously on 12 February 1958. \\n(Compilation of Decisions on Purging the Right in the Party (1), Executive Office of the Central Committee of the CPC Central Committee, 1958)\\nPAGE 6"}

From August 1 to September 10, this stage, we have launched a struggle against Kang mingyao, Wang Xueqi and Liu Weijun, the core elements of the anti-party and anti-socialist right-wing group of Jiusan, Wang Xuechi and Liu Weijun, and invited the Department of Fine Arts, Chinese, and History within the Jiusan Society Branch. Some teachers participated in the assistance and held nearly 40 meetings, both large and small. In the summer season, all the teachers who attended the meeting were untiring and fighting to defend the party and defend the path of socialism. Mr. Yan Lichuan, a teacher of the fine arts department, said this when he was invited to the struggle: 'There are right-wing elements there and I hit there.' During this stage of anti-right struggle, the face of anti-party and anti-socialism of the Kang, Wang and Liu right-wing small groups have been completely exposed because they always abide by the instructions of the Party Committee and insist on the rational struggle with facts and rationale. Wang Xueqi, the behind-the-scenes leader of this small right-wing group, who is cunning, stubborn and concealed deep, has always taken a two-sided approach, good at disguising his original face, and finally had to lose in front of the facts and plead guilty. Kang Ming Yao once said this: 'Reason has put me down.' \\nAnti-Party and anti-socialist right-wing groups with Kang, Wang and Liu at the core have consistently used the opportunities they consider available to conspire to engage in criminal anti-party and anti-socialist acts. Using the opportunity to help the Party to rectify the wind, he launched a crazy attack on Marxist Leninism, the core force leading the construction of our motherland-the Communist Party of China, the ideological weapon that guides us-in an attempt to abolish the leadership of the Party, destroy Marxism, and restore old China. However, Wang Xueqi and Kang mingyao, the core elements of the right-wing group, have repeatedly carried out cunning and trying to mingle with the crimes committed. They only admit: 'Our words and deeds are not conducive to the cause of socialism. Now it seems or raised to the height of principle to analyze it is anti-party and anti-socialist A righteous nature, but there is no motivation for anti-party or anti-socialism.' Wang Xueqi further denied: 'I am not anti-party, not anti-socialism, but some unconscious mistakes.' The comrades present at the meeting made a strong struggle on the basis of a lot of facts. Comrades pointed out that they are deeply abhorrent to the party and to the new society. Wang Xueqi once said: 'There is no freedom of speech and no freedom of silence,' and made a hackling-like saying, 'Uh! Um! That's not the old.' 'There is no freedom of residence, no personal freedom, the Constitution is a dead letter,' said Kang Ming Yao. Liu Weijun said: 'Communist Party rule is violence and foolish policies.' They tried to restore the situation in old China, viewing the anti-revolutionary Hu Feng as a martyr. They are well aware that to revive the path of old China, to which they were in love: the Communist leadership must be abolished politically, and Marxinism must be abolished ideologically. To that end, they carried out a series of conspiracy activities. At the political level, they first controlled the leadership of our branch of Jiusan Society, as a tool to use the policy of mutual supervision of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, and wanted to bring the claws into the leadership of various units in order to exclude the leadership of the Party. They tried to serve as director of the teaching and research group and participate in the departmental committee and journal editorial committee. Active activities have been carried out to that end. Kang mingyao advocates the abolition of the school party committee system, and Wang Xueqi is more blatant in favor of dissolving the Communist Party. In terms of thought, defaming Marxism-Leninism, Kang mingyao said: The dialectical law is manipulation, how is it reasonable to say. Wang Xueqi said: Ma, En, Lien, and Stus are all right. They also launched a comprehensive attack on the party's literary route: opposing the direction of serving workers and farmers, Wang Xuechi said, 'Hu Feng's theory where there is a life there is a struggle is right, and the writer should write what he is most familiar'. Kang mingyao, while cursing popular works of art, oppose the idea that there is no superclass humanity in class society. Wang Xueqi said: 'The work now has no human taste so it is not touching.' 'The art works are just illustrations of the theme,' said Kang Ming Yao. Liu Weijun wrote more openly articles that criticize the definition of Engels realism. In order to counter the leadership of the Party on the literary route, and in order to systematically attack Marxism, they used the hundred families to actively organize anti-party journals in the name of the nine three school society, using the policy of one hundred families to contend with all flowers, in an attempt to establish anti-party positions. In order to realize the above anti-party and anti-socialist conspiracy, they do not hesitate to take advantage of the wrong policy of the vicious and great development of the central center of the Jiusan Society, and develop their members according to their own private wishes, with the despicable means promised by the officials, in order to strengthen their power. They were more rampant during the magnification. Liu Weijun actively supports and incites 'Wen Sanyi Group' to attack the party. Kang mingyao, for his part, encouraged the right-wing, Wang McRod, to enchant his vicious anti-party remarks, saying that he was a good man in Shandong. Wang Xueqi scattered all over Liu Weijun's anti-party and anti-socialist rhetoric from the study of 'Re-talk', and praised him. At the same time, Wang Xueqi attacked the party committee secretary and the Party Central Committee. He said: 'The Chief Personnel Officer (Secretary Li and), should be responsible for combating the problem. Why didn't anyone give advice to the Director of Personnel. And the responsibility is not entirely local, and the Party Central Committee should be responsible.' \\nKang mingyao and Wang Xueqi, the core elements of the right group, were unable to resist in the face of the facts raised by comrades present at the meeting. They had to bow their heads to confess guilt and began to confess, and they put on their own right hat-the right-wing. \\n(2), The fallacy of the right-wing element Liu Weijun\\n'Yugoslavia is not revisionism, but the development of Marxism-Leninism, which must be proven after a hundred years after history,' said Liu Weijun, Department of Chinese Language. \\nClearly, Liu Weijun strongly believes in revisionism and believes that it is the development of Marxism-Leninism. \\nRevisionism was an international opportunity in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, led by Bernstein in the German Social Democratic Party, who denied the proletarian dictatorship and advocated that a peaceful transition from capitalism to socialism could be achieved without the proletarian dictatorship. (Lenin's book 'What to Do' gives it a thorough criticism), more than a hundred years have passed, and revisionism has proved to be a distortion of Marxism-Leninism, can it be proved that it is a 'development of Marxism' in a hundred years? Liu Weijun's arbitrary nonsense has his political intentions. \\nFirst, Liu Weijun attempted to use the theory of revisionism as Marxist-Leninist 'development', denying the method of class analysis, to blur the line of ideas with right-wing elements and blurring class struggles on the current ideological front in order to instigate the masses. Because revisionism denies class struggles? Oppose the understanding of problems in the process of socialist development through the conflict between the proletarian and bourgeois. \\nSecond, Liu Weijun said that revisionism is the 'development' of Marxism, essentially denies the proletarian dictatorship and tries to incite the masses to promote greater democracy, overthrow the Party, and eliminate socialism. Liu Weijun, like some Yugoslav revisionists, denied class struggles within the people, trying to prove that the main danger in our country at present is not the right, but bureaucracy. To divert the attention of the people's struggle, and said: 'Bureaucracy is caused by the socialist system. If you want anti-bureaucracy, you must kill socialism and go to the street... 'Well, Liu Weijun, take this 'theory' to confuse everyone's eyes, but we will not be deceived. 'Again' has long instructed us that anyone who leaves the proletarian dictatorship and speaks about democracy is actually standing on the bourgeois side and opposes proletarian dictatorship, actually calls for capitalism and against socialism. \\nThird, Liu Weijun's revisionist 'theory' denies the democratic centralization system and the leadership of the Party. The bourgeois always asking us to 'liberalize', as does Liu Weijun. Is it not clear that he expressed great pleasure at the 'free speech' of the right-wing elements? No wonder he blames us for criticizing the right-wing rhetoric that 'hats down' is 'closed.' No wonder he was tempted to 'personally host' 'Wensan group' to attack the party. \\nEngels told us that any organization's activities have certain authority and certain obedience. Comrade Lenin also said: 'Denying the party's leadership is tantamount to completely disarming the proletariat to help the bourgeois.' Liu Weijun, do you understand the meaning of this phrase? We are telling you that no clever 'theory' can hide your anti-socialist ugly attitude. (Wen Yiyi Leung Rongxiang)\\n(3), Right activist Liu Weijun in collaboration with Wang Xueqi to carry out rampant attacks against the party\\nLiu Weijun joined the Jiusan Society and wanted to do publications, not to write books and say, fame and gain, but to peddle his reactionary goods in the name of the theft society. The branch branch of the hospital has completely revealed its reactionary nature at two general meetings on the 10th and 11th of this month. Liu Weijun, a right-wing member, has always spread reactionary remarks and wanted to establish a literary and artistic position to attack the party before joining the society. He wants to pull in Director Huang Pan and Comrade Wang Degang (Party member), and fake Director Huang as the lead, while they themselves have the power to review manuscripts, trying to peddler their reactionaries under the guise of party members. As a result, they did not drill in, they wanted to steal the name of '93,' so Wang Xueqi pulled Liu Weijun into the 'nine three'. After Liu joined the community, they seized the opportunity of the Tianjin branch meeting and sent a letter to Gu along with Wang Dazin, a member of the Tianshi and South University, in the hope of gaining their sympathy, and launched an attack on the branch. The branch told them that it was impossible to run a magazine, and that there was no funding at all. They failed again. And turned to the group directly under the Jiusan Hebei Normal Institute launched a crazy attack. At the time of the group meeting, their verbal attitude was arrogant and crazy to the extreme. They sang together, this echoed each other, and resolutely attacking comrades at this group meeting, and openly slandered the leadership and threatened to support it, they claimed the community No money inside, they do it themselves. When pants are OK, as long as the name is given in the house. At that time, they distorted the policy of 'flourishing, one hundred family disputes', and one (Liu), specifically proposed their final text, 'The definition of realism critical Engels' as a model for the publication, and one (Wang), pointed out the 'theory of beauty' of Galtai, as a critical material contained in the second issue of the new construction of this year. This is an article to attack the party, the original editor notes have the following words: such an argument is very debatable ... We also intend to publish in the next issue and the opposite of this paper's argument), for the best current 'snapping out' articles that specifically set the direction of the publication. At the same time, they presented the manuscript that they had already prepared, highlighting 'publication of returned manuscripts from other publications'. Their opposition to Marxism-Leninism was very thorough and went to Engels. At a time when they thought to seize positions, they threw off Marxists' coat and clearly exposed the horrific face of anti-socialist anti-socialism, the anti-socialist literary approach to anti-socialism. The intellectuals are playing pen bars. They understand deeply that pens are more powerful than a knife, so they are determined to steal an anti-socialist publication in the name of the 'nine three'. After the Chinese Department moved to Beijing, they were planning to serve as secretary and member of the branch, and Wang Xueqi was also actively involved in the cultural and educational committee members of the branch in Tianjin. In order to expand the capital of the opposition, they actively pull people into the society within the department. Even members of the regiment allied members have become their target. The policy of right-wing member Liu Weijun in collusion with Wang Xuechi in organizing publications is to attack the Party and attack socialism. This is very obvious. Their conspiracy to steal the name of the 'nine three' is very vicious When the branch assembly on the 10th of this month revealed Wang Xueqi's conspiracy and criticized his reactionary words and deeds, he also categorically did not admit it. Comrades asked him if there were any such publications in the world that highlighted the release of other publications in their manuscripts? He has no answer. Comrades asked what kind of manuscript he returned? He said it was Gall too's article. The fact of iron is already in front of Wang Xuechi. Under the criticism of his comrades, he could not be sopaque, elusive rhetoric, very wolf. Liu and Wang conspired to run anti-party publications. It goes through a rather long process. They have long-term plans and firm resolve. Not only are Liu and Wang complicit in this matter, but here is another concrete example: Liu Weijun called the members of the Communist Youth League as a small tiger. From studying 'again' to the anti-right learning, he always spread his anti-party speech, but Wang Xuechi introduced Liu Weijun's situation in the branch branch expansion committee, but Wang Xueqi focused on Liu Weijun's situation. The main contradiction of the problem lies in the contradiction between the members of the Communist Youth League and him. Some members criticized him and were prearranged. As for Liu Weijun's reactionary argument, he made a very vague and incomplete mention, as a result, the branch assembly that criticized Liu Weijun last month for a while lost its direction. \\nFinally, we warn Liu Weijun that your problem is very serious. The formation of an anti-party group with the members of the department is only part of your evil. We want you to deal thoroughly and never recruit any military without winning. We also warn Wang Xueqi that your own problem is also serious. You should expose Liu Weijun's anti-party words and deeds at an early date and give to your group's insider. Looking back is shore, not too late. (First Group of Jiusan Society, Hebei Tianjin Shiyuan Branch)\\n(4), Liu Weijun and the right group 'Wensan Group' two or three things:\\n1. Liu Weijun instructed 'Wensanan group' said: 'To engage in a purposeful, systematic, first approach the province, then engage in Zhang Rong!' \\nHe said to the backbone of the 'Wensan Group': 'Mr.'s leadership must be sought. The North Normal University is so good because of Muktien's leadership!' The backbone elements who criticized the 'Wensanyi group' 'no organization did not plan' afterwards said: Mr. Liu's criticism and encouragement are quite instructive! As a result, planning was strengthened and teachers were visited. \\n3 students unveiled 'Wen Sanyi group' during the whole wind to perform 'Qu Yuan' Lei Dynasty that play has a vile purpose, the right-wing member Feng Shuchun found Liu Weijun, Liu said: 'How can they not let the show, they can be arranged into a movie', 'It doesn't matter can be reasoned with them!'

Landlord was born, and his father is subject to mass control in land reform. After the opening, he spoke many times at the colloquium, a lot of poisoning, saying that the party had been too fierce in the past, so now there was such a lot of whims; the party looked too heavy on the composition, was mindful, was the reactionary view of the thief's son is a thief; he opposes the evaluation of Comrade Stalin should pass 37, Stalin's mistake It is a 'late' view that Stalin has interfered in Yugoslavia's internal affairs, is a tyrant, a political ambition, and so on. In this article, he carried out a vicious attack on the new society from several aspects such as democratic freedom, the rule of law, and intellectuals, and described the new society as a dark one; at the same time, he also provoked the country's relations with the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. \\nDemocracy and Freedom\\nIs there democracy and freedom in our society? I don't dare to say too sure. But I like democracy, I like freedom. And some people, in his opinion, do not like democracy, especially freedom, just like hating stinky dog dung. They confuse freedom with liberalism, anarchism, bourgeoisie thinking, and opposing freedom and discipline. What are the consequences of these arguments? Bring the trialism to the spread of these years, brought the deathy of academic thought, and brought the formula and conceptualization of the monopoly on literature and art. Last year's general election, I proposed that way of being less democratic, someone first gave me a stick and said I wanted to promote a capitalist campaign. It has been said that elections need to be democratic in substance and not formal. But it turns out: without democracy in its form, there is no substantial democracy. Last year's major elections, some say Xiao Yuanxia was inappropriate, and the result was suppressed. At the time of election voting, the people turned into machines that would only raise the pen to circle. \\nThe constitutional freedoms of expression, assembly, association and the press are not guaranteed. Most of the power of the press lies in the hands of party members, and articles that are out of track cannot be published at all. Want to go out the wall? Want freedom of assembly and association? Beware of giving you the last instigation sin. The rule of law does not exist in our country. Judges adjudicate the case subjective, kill, and forgive. The director of a sports committee in Guangzhou, insulted a cadre's personality, violated human rights and forced the death of a person. As a result, the court sentenced only one year suspended prison sentence. It was really officials who took care of. A party committee at a construction site in Chengdu forced a couple of lovers to commit suicide, and afterwards anti-slander said, 'Suicide is to cover up its political reactionary nature.' Although there were fewer people who made mistakes and persecuted people after liberation, the bad things they did did did did not strike the people worse than the Kuomintang. In the past 'East is not bright', you can 'go to the West', but a few years ago, a musty fell like falling into hell, never 'superborn'. When I was in middle school, I had suffered a crackdown by a Turkish Emperor group, and when they came to a great deal, they had a political problem with some material down from the sky, as if not pushing me into hell. And what did they do? Take a teenage high school student to fight, saying that someone else is in love and takes others down to Guizhou (forcing others to kneel to confess), suspicion that others steal things, and then forced others to drop out of school and take drugs afterwards. They really lost their goodness, but they have always been on the verge, by members of the team and party members, by the deputy director and the principal. What means do they make? That is: licking fat ass, long tongue; pedal someone else's pain feet head heavy. They crawled others in order to climb up. Naturally this kind of person is very few, but 'a screw can break a pot of soup', their power, we can't eat. The reason why such individual deeds are so lawless is because of unequal treatment, people have no rights, they make big mistakes and are not subject to legal sanctions; they make minor mistakes and do not review them. I hope our dear party will pay more attention to the illegal behavior of these impurities in the future. \\nAs for the high definition of intellectuals, I think there are also historical roots. When the Kuomintang, the intellectuals are not accustomed to their corruption. After liberation, the intellectuals were high because they were not valued. Intellectuals are told to care about politics, but they are allowed to raise their right hand (shouting slogans), give intellectuals freedom, and keep them in cages. In particular, there are some so-called intellectuals, full of brain-shell bean kara, only know to run with someone else's ass to fight upright intellectuals. So some intellectuals became Tao Yuanming, went to 'dengdonggao to Shu Xiao, Linqing stream and give poetry'. \\nsectarianism\\nSectarianism is the most dangerous among the 'three hazards', and it is serious to hurt the people of the country. I agree with the ancients who said that sectarianism was born with a sense of exploitation. Because of sectarianism, there was a privileged idea of party members, some impure elements, saw the profit of joining the party, they did not hesitate to brag the horse and climb, their goal was not communism, but money, beauty, status. No wonder some girls look for objects to form three members (party members, technicians, 80 yuan), a long (section chief or director, etc.). \\nMy views on some international issues\\nAfter Tito's speech last year, it caused a strong reaction from communist newspapers. We also wrote the article 'On the proletarian dictatorship' and criticized it. I agree with the criticism, but I think Tito's speech has a desirable part, for example, that socialism should have democracy and humanity, which cannot be denied to him. As for someone who said it was good in the past, I think he was covering Stalin's wrong route. 'Tito receives both Soviet aid and US aid,' the minister said. Is a two-sided approach, is for money.' I think it is a bit insulting to others, not in the interest of unity, and negates the diplomatic character of others. \\nFor the economic assistance given to us by the Soviet Union, I am grateful for this selfless spirit of internationalism. But I also think there are some individual experts who bring in addition to some internationalism, but also some chauvinism. I sincerely hope that chauvinism will be thrown away, so that the unity of the Chinese and Soviet people is closer and more sincere. As for, some middle and lower cadres in our country, the kind of blindly worship, the style of hard lifting is quite worth correcting. They only knew the phrase 'learn from the Soviet Union', they only brought the backward experience of the Soviet Union, and they signed and called execution in the factory and mine; there was a problem with the technicians and called the technicians responsible. Technicians really fell musty, were seen as rice barrels, hangers. I want to be unfair, I want to respect technicians, respect intellectuals.

Is there something to say to write Yumen? Now, talk about a 'Tianfang Night Tan' buried in the depths of the oil mine. \\nYumen oil mine has two brothers and brothers, both before and after being the main managers of the oil mine, are knowledgeable, instrument hall, talented, all have the ideals of the world economy. But their destiny is very different. Brothers are high in the temple, brother is in the depth of hell. And the fate comes from oil, all are the accumulation of Yumen oil deposits, and the Yumen oil mine has suffered a woe. So, I tied this story to the Yumen Oil Mine, just like the Song Dynasty literature documented oil, to history, to evoke, think, sigh, comment. \\nThe brother who went to the temple is Kang shiying Shien, a well-known name. From leading the PLA to taking over the Yumen oil mine, to being Minister of Oil, to becoming Vice Premier of the State Council, he became a senior party and state leader. \\nAnd this deep brother of hell is Kang shiying Shiying, a little known name. He sent to Yumen as the main leader of the oil mine from the Kuomintang government. By 1949, he gave the Yumen oil mine completely to the Communist Party, specifically to his brother's representative communist party. Since then, a real movie legend in life was staged. Unfortunately, the world did not know that this was not shot. Into the presence of real movie stories into movies. \\nBecause he is a well-known figure, there has been a lot of his reports in the news and television, and also published biographical works such as the Memoirs of Cang Shien and the Biography of Kang shiying Shien. In documenting the history of China's petroleum development, Kang shiying Shien's name is also always associated with the history of China's oil development, recounts together, so, not to repeat the history of Kang shiying Shien. It is simply to say that in 1949, he led the PLA West into the West and took over the Yumen oil mine by order of the Central People's Government of the CPC. And this takeover was carried out with his brother. The ceremony was how the scene, the atmosphere, no image data left. And the handover of the historical instruments Ken\\nIt must be kept at the Yumen oil mine archives. This is only a cursory explanation of the blood and tears tragedy of Cangseion's brother. \\nBecause I have relatives with Kang shiying Shiying's descendants, I have a brief knowledge of some of the tragedy of Kang shiying Shiying, but they do not know very detailed. His descendants do not want to touch the history of this pain, rarely tell outsiders about their family, occasionally mentioned, sigh, and very simple, unwilling to say things very thoroughly, they have too many unhealed wounds in their hearts, so I can only say a general, even some details here. Xu is not very accurate, but the overall situation is real and dare to be a little fiction. \\nAfter Kang shiying took over the Yumen oil mine under his brother's jurisdiction, his brother was treated as a meritorious intifada for defending the oil mine not being destroyed and sincerely welcomed the Communist Party and its people's government to take over the oil mine. Arranged to Jiuquan and Zhangye Land Committee to do the work of staff members, enjoying better political and economic treatment. In 1957, the Chinese knew what happened in that year. In the absence of a right, a person who has done business for the old regime is naturally the right. His brother was the right, and in the historical context of that time, it was also natural for the brother to draw the boundaries. The problem is far from there, and doom is escalating. Under the pressure of frequent political movements, every movement arrives to receive a higher standard of treatment. First, he took office, then imprisoned, and then disappeared from prison until his flesh and soul evaporated forever and entered space. The bitterness of the skin, the process of spiritual destruction and the tribulation of the heart is imaginable. The problem is also that Kang shiying Shiying was taken away, where his children do not know; he heard of being in jail, where his children did not know; and he heard of death, where he died, and his children did not know. The counter-revolutionary family had no reason and authority to inquire about his father's whereabouts. Finally, I heard that a prison in the depths of Gobi died in an inaccurate place in the vast gobi. Nature has no affidavit, no relics left to anyone. Where do his children want to look for their bones, vast gobi, Haohao Shahai? \\nThrowing a person into the Gobi desert is like throwing a person into the sea and cannot be found. \\nIt was later known that he disappeared in the place described in the Chronicle of the Edge Ditch. \\nIn fact, today it seems that people throw into the sea after death, it is buried by the sea, although the flesh into the fish belly, but the soul into the ocean, how deep it is; and thrown into the Gobi, is the Gobi burial, is also an unprecedented burial custom, although the flesh into the wolf mouth, but the soul into space, what is it? \\nAre the perfect destination, you can't find. \\nI thought of the Tibetan burial. The burial is sacred, holy, chop people into pieces, thrown into the sky, the eagles hover their flesh, the dead become eagles, soaring in the sky. I also thought of the great man's 'sea burial', 'spread the ashes in the sea', the deceased into the sea, with the heavens, the soul directly ascended to heaven, this is how good to create and practice! The children of Kang shiying Shiying should believe that their father was buried after purgatory is sacred by sin, and that the bliss world welcomed him. \\nKang shiying Shiying went to Bliss World, leaving five minor children. In order to feed his younger brother, the boss went to the Yumen oil mine, which brought his father's disaster to his uncle, and became a miner in the Yumen oil mine under his uncle's jurisdiction. At that time, human resources were scarce and went to the oil mine work, did not need to go back door, so instead of walking the back door of Kang shiying Shien to enter the oil mine, but to enter the Yumen oil mine for a livelihood. In order to feed the family, the brother took on the responsibility of his father, and the monthly salary was sent home for the younger siblings to live. In order to feed the family, his brother did not marry for life. At the age at which he was able to marry, he could not marry for political and economic reasons. He was old when political and economic conditions allowed him to marry. So far, the 80s older brother alone, live a sad life. Brothers and sisters also retire in a bullet. They are entangled by the inexhaustible thoughts of their father and the sadness of life. \\nWhen the boss worked under his uncle Kang shiying Shien, Kang shiying also took care of his nephew at work. However, due to the social atmosphere at that time, as a nephew, carrying a heavy burden of thought, there was no 'ambition', as an uncle, style was also well-established, did not use power to promote the nephew's half-duty. Although Kang shiying Shien is a minister of oil and deputy prime minister of the State Council, his nephew worked for a lifetime in the oil system and remained a worker when he retired. This is incredible in today's social climate. \\nIn 1994, Kang shiying Shien inspected in Lanzhou. He met with his nephew and niece at the Ning Wozhuang Hotel. Family reunion, rarely brisk laughter, air, more coagged, heavy and stuffed, no words also sigh, some words also sigh. Are they glorious uncle's prominence, or are they sighing the sad ending of their father? Only have a taste in the heart. \\nI asked the second son of Kang shiying Shiying, why didn't I find the government for his father in 80 years ago or so? He replied that when he felt there was no hope at first, when he felt hopeful, the government department had stopped answering work. Great things, heavy burdens, painful torments, so give up. The muna and honestness of the descendants of Kang shiying Shiying are amazing \\nThe two brothers of Kang shiying Shien have merit for the Yumen oil mine, and for the country. Kang shiying Shien is a vice premier of the State Council for granted. His brother is unfair to be a wild ghost on the Gobi beach. Kang shiying Shiying, the Kang shiying Shien family and the Yumen oil mine are indelible. \\nIn Yumen's article, Kang shiying Shien and the oil mine are the objects of praise, while his brother's existence and role are unknown. So when writing the Hexi Corridor series of Yumen articles, leave aside other words, only write the Kang shiying's two brothers, thinks their brother recruits. Let the world know that Hexi walk...\\nI gave this material to those who aspire to create TV dramas and let them reproduce this history on their screen. Of course, the descendants of Kang shiying's family are extremely reluctant to mention this history, whether they can dig deeper into the material and whether they agree. But leaving a real history is always valuable. (Author is the former faculty of Lanzhou Petrochemical Company staff vocational education college)"}

Whosoever is unhappy with the party, he will incite. Even incite comrades who have no dissatisfaction with the party to go to the opposition. When he knew that Mr. Lin Bairong was going to attend the old lecturer symposium, he rushed to Mr. Lin's house for the first time and took two fabricated opinions to Mr. Lin to put it. He also said to Song Zhiliang and others, 'You have been mistaken in the fight. You can make comments, and I fully support it.' To another object, say, 'Why fight you? You're not a counter-revolution! The Communist Party treats you, right? You should be enlarged!' He also insidiously took one thing and, in two different terms, ignited three people. Kang shouyi and righteousness also viciously attack the rebellion. Not only did he encourage those who were fighting to rise to 'pacification', but also repeatedly proclaimed for Feng GuoGeneral's statement: 'Counteracting achievements are secondary, mistakes are the main', 'fight against no material,' and 'set up darkroom interrogation', and encouraged everyone to listen to Feng GuoGeneral's slander. Also warned that 'if you don't listen, the mind is going to fall behind.' Until the end of the whole school's anti-right basically ended, he still despite the students' objections, allowed Feng Guo to participate in the selection of the school swimming team without prior registration, in an attempt to select Feng Guo as a representative. Kang shouyi Shouyi, so hate the Party and the people, because he was very good at speculative and improper. He was the sales director of a private factory before liberation, speculation, crafty, exploitation of workers, maneuver, and accustomed to the bourgeois ideology that penetrated his bone marrow. There was no mentality transformation after liberation. In class, corporal punishment was used against students, and the attitude was brutal, causing the classmates to practice spit blood and dare not to tell him; blow others in the teacher and raise themselves; flatter the leadership, blow beard, gazing, satirical and abusive to the staff. So he usually does not teeth for ordinary people. More than 570 school-teacher students are classified as right-wing; battered, expelled, re-education and imprisonment; immediate problems with their education, employment and choice of spouse, discontinued throughout their lives and relatives; many have died during or after political persecution campaigns that year or later, suicide, killing, Hunger killing, shooting, the end of the scene is extremely tragic."}

Sick passed away in 1969 \\nIn May 1958, the main facts listed in dealing with the right are:\\n(1), distort the redemption policy, deny that interest is exploitation. To think that the redemption is the government's money to buy his stuff, fixed rates are not exploiting the residual value of the working class. \\n(2), deny the two-sided nature of the senior class, oppose the transformation of the rebirth, saying: 'Reborn' is the Tao's argument, so that the capitalist's 'transformation infinite extension', only the second life of good people. \\n(3), advocating the abolition of class relations, denying the party's leadership.

According to Central Document [1978] 55, the 1957 Central criteria for the division of right-wing elements, the decision was made to rectify it, restore honour and dispel the influence, and the material of the relevant departments dealing with the issue in the files of the children of their families should be destroyed. \\nOur Ministry has made an uncorrected conclusion on 22 January this year on the right, and it is now investigated that the defamation of the socialist system listed in that conclusion is a matter of tyranny.

Now is the vice chairman of the civil society and the Federation of Commerce and industry, city people's representatives, municipal people's Committee. Kang has always been hostile to the Party, believing that the Communist Party and capitalists 'cannot stand side by side.' He 'did not feel that the bourgeois is stinky', 'does not want to pick up a hat', 'does not want the rebellion,' and firmly stands on the bourgeois position, the leader of the opposition party and opposes the socialist cause. \\nIn this article, he denies the exploitative nature of interest; denies the distinction between 'public' and 'private'; opposes the need for 'reforming' bourgeois, advocates the elimination of the names of 'public' and 'private' representatives, and advocates that people regardless of class, regardless of class, whether public or private, are in essence an attempt to erase the working class and the bourgeois. Level essential difference, change the political direction of the party's cadre policy, thus reaching the opposition And the purpose of the working class leadership. \\nHe said that the current public-private relations are good for a few, the few do very well. Most are in the middle state, and most private parties do not play an active role. \\nThe relationship is good, but only the personnel office is good, the job has the right to work. It is not dare to say that it has fully contributed talents and meets the requirements of the State. In this regard, I have the following observations:\\n(A), the issue of the distinction between public and private parties. I am very skeptical about policies, such as redemption policy, private ownership issues, so-called redemption is your thing, and I give you the price, control is not yours, but business owners have handed over, and today they still say that private ownership has not been abolished. Such as Minsheng company ships, docks, hoarding boats, early handed out, the name does not exist, what else has the right? There is therefore a problem with the assertion that private ownership still exists. Minsheng companies themselves do not have the right to deal with property, as are other joint venture stores. Private ownership requires itself to have the right to count, and now both property has been handed over, how can we say private. Holding shares have fixed rates, that is redemption, your things give me, you have contracted to give money every year, the right is no longer for you, so only economic relations, just installment payments. The state has invested some money, sent people called the public and can also say that 'private representatives' simply do not work. You have shares that are only shareholders, and even shareholders can't say anything. Before the business form has not changed, there is also a board of directors and private parties. Today, the production of nuclear capital has been liquidated and handed over, the private representative, what does it represent? Neither business nor profit or loss, what does the 'private party' represent? I think the four words 'public-private partnership' can not be desired. The national policy is to buy, there are only more than 100 million in a year. For example, there is a lot of shares in Minsheng Company. No one can say that, although private shares have figures, there are no tables. I said that all those working in an enterprise are called cadres. They must have a job, have the right, and have responsibility, regardless of the source, the responsible person is the person in charge. As long as there is responsibility, they can have a job, have the right, have the right and have the right and responsibility of the enterprise to do it. What public or private parties do not care about him, at best the accounting department has a message distribution work. \\nEnterprises are not connected with fixed income. What are the sub-rights of the joint venture or the private party? So the 'public' 'private' party name first need to be canceled. \\n(2), Why does the issue of having authority occur? In fact, it is very simple. If jobs are distributed according to meritocracy, what comes from the issue of authority, the government has care for the business sector, but business and businessmen should know themselves and have merit to assume it. If you don't understand it will not be a manager, learn to come again. We cannot have the idea of eating a lifetime of care for meals. This is the business side. On the government side, if he has merit, he should give him a manager, if not, can't simply emphasize care, because it is not good to emphasize taking care of the following, so, it will make you not work, and send a deputy official manager to help you. This is actually called a post and no authority. Because of this, there is a certain college reflecting that Kind of 'Benpaid dean due to business trip, post by the principal dean' joke. \\n(3), class relations issues. I don't understand that in an enterprise, there must be more than just workers and bourgeois, there must be farmers and small bourgeois. In the case of the small bourgeois, there are also many drawbacks. Are workers also treated as bourgeois? I don't know. And there must be class relations where the bourgeois go. The working-class sees fear of corrosion, the bourgeois meets workers afraid to speak afraid to erode him. In the future, this idea is the idea of inferiority, but it is also a 'fear' thought left behind by history. Class relations are so strict that public and private relations are good, I think it's hard to see. \\nThere is also a saying that the bourgeois is different from the working class, because it is still taking a fixed rate, taking a fixed rate called exploitation, and can't make sense. Fixed interest is a ransom. Chairman Mao said that this is what the two sides agreed to do so, but not what I want, it is you giving it. But today, it is to see people dwarf three inches. As to whether or not to exploit, the People's Daily says that I have different views, such as the value created by workers, I divided, that is exploitation, fixed income is my thing, the price that I give me, it is not the money I created by going to divide the working class, so the central leadership said to take it. Breath is to protect your rights. This is never an offer with the working class to exploit you, let alone force the working class to give it, so some people can't make sense of fixed income as exploitation. \\nIt is certain that class is to be eliminated, but Chairman Mao said that everyone needs to be reformed. I admit that the bourgeois is poison deep, but the People's Daily says 'to get back', and some of the business and businessmen actually call themselves to be born. According to my reading reading book understanding, rebirth is a Taoist's argument, a man monastic, repair to the head out of the baby called the birth, change the bone is a fairy bone, so to mention whether to learn from the business community, out of the baby, change the fairy bone, I see that only two lives are good people, the bourgeois are not people, ancestors are all three generations It was wrong. Even some CPPCC members spoke and turned their birth into a topic. How can this cause people not to be inferior. How is the elimination class to destroy the law? Whether to give up fixed rate is it? Is the second life good man? This is called an indefinite extension. Why don't the bourgeois leaders be inferior. Some people say: 'Do not face good to be the backbone', to say yourself how not, how not, how bad, is the backbone, saying that good people in the second life is the backbone. I see that the bourgeois has actually been wiped out. Its two characteristics, one called only profit is profit, one called the loss of profit, and now it is no longer there. \\n(4), The issue of party-non-party relations. If corporate administration is not separated from the party, the private side cannot in any case, the party is a political organization that is the driving force of all kinds of work and is needed, but if you take the party to replace the administration and arrange everything, it will not work. Enterprises are not more than three jobs: one called administration, two called business, three called personnel, party organizations are acting on behalf of all three things, non-party members can only be subject to control, do not listen to the drums to do. If now, the division of labor is very good, but some people say it is my responsibility, just the party said I signed it. Not to mention the Personnel Section, it will not call the private party at all. How is it possible to have the right to do this? Therefore, in institutions or enterprises, the party committee system, even if it exists, should reverse sectarianism. Today, non-party members cannot become sectarian. Party committee system is good, but it is not a substitute for administration. Otherwise, non-party people could not have the right. \\n(5), Today, the country takes very good care of businessmen, the bourgeois, but it is not in a number of enterprises, what do we have? Always feel that there is something bad to say, say only bad, no benefit, why would this kind of thought be generated? I think it is mainly the lack of friendship between the parties and non-parties. A person can not come up with a sense of knowledge, things need to be studied, but there are always three big piles of business (party, regiment, non-party). This has a historical relationship, and the staff of the party congress always treat the bourgeois as a live hemp of poisonous grass, and cannot touch. There is no room for research or research opportunities. Party members did not want to establish friendship with businessmen, and even if they had this mind, there was no opportunity to do so. This is a common phenomenon, touching the nail twice. Summarizing the above situation, I have the following suggestions:\\n1. Cancel the name of public and private representatives. \\n2, arrange the work only to ask for good, not public and private, care can be taken care of in other areas, such as less work, life difficulties give more money, but the position of authority should not take care of. \\n3, do not see whether party members, non-party members, only look at ability and morality, do not emphasize class relations. Many non-party figures, such as the preservation of walls and ditches, have greatly hindered the cause of nation-building. \\n4. Establish friendship. Man is an emotional animal, 'Ekos treats me, I am Kokusai'. In this way, positive factors can be realized, and the potential is not limited. The old society has a large share of private business and commerce. The economic base is actually based on private businesses. Businessmen and businessmen have the ability and experience. Now the state-run economy is strong, and there is a new economic foundation. If the power of the whole business community is fully exploited, the old and new ones are integrated into one, and the future development will be at least Can be doubled.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attachment 8】Happiness such as: 'The private party obeys the leadership of the public, there will be a ditch and a wall-a speech at a symposium for business people' (1957.5.23)\\nThe original editor's note: Happiness, as the 'four walls' mentioned in this speech, is essentially a problem: emphasizing the essential difference between the working class and the bourgeois and the leadership of the working class, there must be a ditch and wall. Therefore, to break the wall and fill the ditch, the bourgeois must be treated equally. The leadership of the working class cannot be emphasized. 'The essence of the wall is class relations', and obedience to the leadership of the squarely 'natural becomes powerless'. This is a basic argument for all right-wing elements in business to attack the party. It's just that the statements are different. \\nI think the joint venture has not only walls, but also four kinds of walls. These four kinds of walls are: 1. public-private relations, 2. class relations, 3. party-non-party relations, 4. \\nFirst talk about public-private relations. Both public and private representatives are necessary for pre-industry joint ventures, because there are boards of directors and private representatives can do something for the private sector. However, after the completion of the liquidation of nuclear capital and the whole industry joint venture, there is no need to separate public and private representatives. Because, at this time, the private parties have been assigned appropriate positions according to their respective abilities, and the enterprises have also paid and only paid the interest; shareholders are not seeking private parties, and disputes do not seek private parties. What else can private representatives represent? There was still something to do with a former private representative, and now it was just an abstract term. However, in the companies below, the public and private are very distinct, and also with a tail-to obey the square-led leadership. Some are deputy manager, private is a positive manager, but the manager should be led by a deputy manager. \\nThe essence of the wall is class relations. It is the bourgeoisie that has become private parties in the enterprise, and the public are working class. Since the bourgeois is led by the working-class, private personnel in enterprises must also obey the leadership of employees. With this class division, private personnel will not dare to approach workers, afraid of people saying corrosive workers; employees also do not dare to approach private personnel, afraid to lose their position. \\nParty-non-party relations. The official manager is often also a party branch secretary, and there is nothing to grasp, and private personnel will have no authority. \\nWith the above three relationships, the relationship in the post is confused. After the private party is arranged as a manager, the public official should obey the private party in office. However, because of the above wall barriers, it becomes a problem to have the right of private parties, and naturally becomes powerless. For these reasons, it is not surprising that the wall is naturally formed. Since the wall is so high, how can private personnel play an active role? To say that private personnel do not play an active role, private personnel really have a lot of wrongs! Why not take press only to hire to play his right? And to build this kind of wall? I believe that more than 90 per cent of the private sector are now inactive, and that the responsible government bears the primary responsibility, and the private side. \\nHow to disassemble the wall? I suggest that the government employs people, regardless of class, ask only how to virtue, give the position, give power; they should have responsibilities in addition to the right, and have the responsibility to accomplish the task. To moral people, then the wall is not demolished. \\nWhether it is an organ or an enterprise, the party organization is necessary. However, there should be a division of competencies. The executive power should not interfere with the party organization, except to master the policy. Party organizations can supervise the executive head, but should not interfere with his power. It is questionable whether the party and the executive head of some enterprises are the same person. In this way, the role of the party is not great, and managers cannot monitor themselves themselves. Today are all people. Without trust, you will not be given a post, and he should be given the right. \\nEvery life in society he has knowledge and feelings. His knowledge has been taken into account since the government. After tea, private personnel are talking about: the Communist Party, as the name suggests, is to be communist. Communist people are not afraid, that is, how should I live after the Communist Party? At the beginning of liberation, the policy was in all directions, namely, public and private balance, labor and labor, etc. The bourgeois thinks that the river does not commit well water, capitalists are happy in their hearts and are willing to engage in enterprises, that is, so-called profit is the profit. Suddenly came to a 'five anti' movement, really a blue bolt; even property life could not be preserved. Of course, this is not the case with government policy. It was also impossible to use wind and rain at that time. Later, the government said that capitalists are national wealth, and we need us to run business hard, then capitalists slowly rise up again. But still don't know what your future is? When the whole industry joint venture, found the fate of the destination. Glad to welcome the whole industry public-private partnership. Some say that the bourgeois is barely, is false, and I disagree with this statement. Is it still false to beat the drum? \\nAfter the joint venture, the government made arrangements for the positions of bourgeois, and each had their own benefits. At this time the bourgeois gratitude is unspeakable. They all have an ambition, ambition, to be able to contribute talents to the nation. Whosoever knows that things are not done, as ideal, the private side has no right to form to take care of the meal, so that the ambition and ambition are gone. It seems that we have arranged, the money will be finished, and friendship is not at all. We also need to transform us, we will be 'reborn' to transform. Thought fluctuation is very large, we think that 'he is not expected to live in this life', had to wait for transformation. However, Chairman Mao said: Chinese intellectuals have such characteristics: 'The poor cannot be moved, rich cannot be fooled, and mighty can not surrender'. 'I treat me as a nation, I treat me as a nation, I treat me as people, and I treat all people,' saying that I eat and take care of the meal, how can I play a positive role? \\nThis degree of friendship cannot be exchanged with a policy of redemption and the care of a few money. But usually care and help each other. The State should make use of intellectuals, not only to give certain political and economic treatment, but also to be self-aware. Many party members died for the party, not for status, political and economic treatment, but because the party trusted him and he loved the party. Although the bourgeois have two sides, there are still people with party membership qualities. As long as the party treats these people as their own, they will also die for the party. \\nThe bourgeois also used brains and hard work when they started their homes. It is good to use their positive elements for socialist construction and should be applied well. \\nFriendship is the driving force for all positive factors. Without friendship, it becomes an employment relationship. The benefits of using their abilities are great, because these people are mature, have a set of skills to transform them and use them much faster than training talent. \\nBreaking the wall, coupled with friendship, we will be active. \\nComments on the Government were also addressed. The masses responded that the government should have an outcome on everything. It would be desirable to have a reply and give reasons for it. However, many questions have not been answered, for example, when Chongqing ceased to operate during liberation, has been cleaned up for seven years now, and has not yet been successful. In 1954, I asked the Government how to deal with it. In August 1956, it was said that the end of August was cleaned up, but now the sea fell. Meifeng asked the People's Bank of China for more than 10 business matters. There is still no reply and fear of questioning reflects the lack of results. How many cases have not replied under the Government's inspection and have they been filed? Someone else is still waiting for a reply. I propose to follow the example of the court to clean up cases since the liberation of the city, I'm afraid there are thousands of unanswered! This drag style does not include it in the whole wind. The dragging style is worse than the old society, and failure to respond is tantamount to life imprisonment.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attachment Nine】Du Xinxin: 'Memories of History Hutong' ('Learning Connaught' 2019.1.22\\nAuthor Profile\\nDu Xinxin, born in 1954 in Chongqing, grew up in Beijing. In 1969 he went to Northeastern countryside with her mother, after seven years as a worker. He was admitted to university in 1978 and studied in the United States in 1984, currently residing in the United States. Has published 'Ganges: from the present world to life' (Guangxi Normal University Press 2007), 'This went to thousands of mountains' (Guangxi Normal University Press 2012). \\nAfter many years to come back here, those old doors, the original life, can no longer be found. \\nIn the 1/1960s, I went to boarding primary school in Beijing. My mother often went to the field, so I had to stay in school on weekends. As long as such days, my old babysitter Wong (I call her swaddling), can't look. Swaddling had been working in Zhang Jia for many years, and she asked the owner to let me go to her for a weekend. Zhangjia lives in Shijia Hutong. This alley is heading east and west, west is located in Meishi Street, Zhangjia lives in the east exit, close to Rumi Cang. I tend to take the first car to Dengshi Dongkou Street, through Meishi Street, into Shijia Hutong West Exit, go to Zhangjia. It is said that in the Ming and Qing Dynasty era, Dengshikou, Rumi Cang, and Rice City Street were bazaars or granaries, but when I lived there, those streets had nothing to do with light rice grain. \\nDengshi Dongkou Street on both sides of the school, the only small store is located in the South Road, just at the intersection with Mi City Street. There is only one door wide, and there is a small counter selling pastries and ice cream. Dengshi Dongkou Street Road North has a not long alley, named Tongfujiao Road. Female 12 middle school (formerly known as Beiman girl, later changed to 166 secondary school), and the Air Administration and the Cultural Corps are in that small alley. Therefore, there are often some young men and women who have a generous style to eat ice cream in the shop. The ice cream was rare at that time, with a silver spoon, dig the ice cream into a white, slightly yellowish ball, placed in a glass cup and carefully placed on it. Diners eat, there are some 'scared in the mouth, held in the hands afraid of crooked' like careful. \\nIn 2014, I returned to Beijing and saw that the store has expanded into three or four door-wide Daoxiang Village confectionery chain. At that time, there were no shops in the city street, and there were few pedestrians in the street, and it was incredible to want to come now. In my impression, the Beijing People's Art Theatre had a display window on the street with stills and pictures of dance beauty. Go east along Mi City Street and soon see Luxi's Red Star Cinema. I generally remember that it was a two-storey red brick house, the theater initially only screened news documentaries, the scene was small, the audience was small, and it looked some old depression. \\nIt was later heard that it was originally the Auditorium of the Beijing YMCA, the first name 'Rick Cinema'. In January 1947, it was renamed 'North Ocean Cinema'. After 1949, changed to Red Star Cinema. \\nClose to Dongdan Street and Dahua Cinema, it is located in Ludong, bigger than the Red Star Theater, and trendy. I remember that many black-and-white photographs of well-known actors were hung on the wall of the entrance hall, including Zhao Dan, Bai Yang, Sun Dao-lin, Shangguan Yunzhu, Qin Yi, Zhang Ruifang, Wang Danfeng and so on. The imaging angle of the star is not the front of the people without crown photo, and the people in the photograph are generous, memorable at first sight. Go to Shijia Hutong West Exit, not far away is Shijia Hutong primary school. I looked in from the vermilion gate of primary school, I only saw the small front yard and the shadow wall, which was very quiet. \\nIt was not heard of key primary schools at that time, but the primary school had a very good reputation. History Hutong primary school, embarked on for a while, is the gate of the people's art theater. Remember there was a delivery room, red brick building, but I never went in. Although I was young, I also knew that there were some big actors living in the yard, every time I walked with the thoughts of who could not meet, and in the end nobody did not meet. There are also a number of closed big red doors in Shijia Hutong, the green gray high wall next to the red door is very neat, the wall is not seen trees. Occasionally encountered open the door, the probe looks, also can not see the fame inside. Later I learned that Fu Zuoyi, Liu Wenhui, Xu Xiangqian, Hua Guofeng, Rong Yiren, Zhang Shizhao and other celebrities have lived in this alley. \\nThere was also a garrison in the early alley. Their site was a four-storey building with iron railings in front. At that time, there was a slippery gray wall on both sides of the alley, the recesses were mostly small doors, and the garrison buildings were very prominent. \\nIn 2014, when I returned, the building was converted to a hotel. Many alley trees are planted in Beijing. Spring locust blossom, incense an alley. In the summer, locust trees often evergreen soft worms, worms pulled the silk hanging down, we call that 'hanging devil'. We girls walked too much to avoid, and boys specifically provoked 'hanging dead ghosts' to scare people. However, there is no such tree in Shijia Hutong, of course, there are no people who are cool under the trees, many of Beijing's alley have public toilets, and can sniff out where it is located, but I remember the Shijia Hutong has no public toilets. In the winter, many alley around the sewer will freeze, frozen leftover vegetables on the ice, and Shijia Hutong few such phenomena, so Shijia Hutong West Exit, clean and lack of popularity. \\nShijia Hutong, the more the east, the more popular. In summer, men in the alley often bare or wear only old men's shirts. Girls wear short-sleeved dresses and skirts, and for some time people called 'Braj', I guess it's Russian pronunciation. Cheongsam is a relatively 'old society' clothes, although it is also a dress, but not many people wear. In winter, older people wear black quilted pants, black jacket front common white spot, that is commonly known as 'rice grain' (food residues), in Beijing. Middle-aged people like a shirt in a jacket jacket, color partial, black gray and blue. Lads are more frozen, some people only wear thick sweaters. Young children or girls are dressed slightly brightly, but the blouse is rarely fitted. In general, there are a few children at home, must be big to wear small, and then wear it. \\nI was a one-born woman. My mother always bought me clothes and shoes, and later I was a little flat foot, said to be the result of wearing big shoes for hours. My blouse is short and will reveal a big cut jacket, thin? Squeeze down the front placket. I remember some time popular line, the color is very good, but can not stand to wash, wash two water shrink. The material is very strong, although small, my mother also let me wear, the result is not only unsightly, but also easily dirty. At that time the jacket is not washable in winter, cover up at least twice a month, the result is a clean cover with dirty padded jacket. In winter, men wear velvet hats, most women around the flower grid square headscarf, wearing a long bib seems quite Western style. Men and women like to wear sleeves, if not wearing sleeves, the cuffs are grind glossy. \\nSome of the alley in Beijing are alley sets of alley, Shijia Hutong also set up small alley. My place of residence is called Dongluo Hoop, is a small alley set in it, and the opposite is the Xilo circle. This alley is short, and there is a small empty field like 'Luo Circle'. Zhangjiazu's house is a street door to two families. Go into the north room, a small narrow yard in front of the room. Usually there are only dads, moms, daughters and old babysitters. His big brother, who studied at the Harbin Military Engineering Institute, came back to the Spring Festival. At that time, the students of Kazakhstan military industry were active military personnel. His brother came back in a navy uniform, tall and skinny, very handsome. Usually we all play in the yard, rarely out of the street. Big brother takes us to the street to buy new goods to buy firecrackers when he comes back. The advantage of going out with a big brother is that he can take the lord for us to buy what we usually want, but adults don't buy things, such as rock sugar gourd. \\nTogether with the moon, the store began selling sugar gourd, that snack and summer popsicles similar, cheap and delicious, but the little kids at that time did not have money to buy. There were not many opportunities to go to the street with adults. Even if there was, my mother always rejected my humble desire on the grounds of 'unhygienic'. Remember the good snow that year, big brother built a snow wall in the courtyard, invited the children next door to fight snow battle. Later the snow battle turned into a melee, and every child's ears were stuffed with snow. At night, brother took off the military uniforms and put firecrackers with us string alley. Beijing people call the children living in the alley, especially the children raised in the alley as 'hutong', while the string of alley firecrackers is the typical act of the festival. As soon as the day wiped the black, we squat at the leeward of the wall, or hiding in a fork. Seeing an unaccompanied shadow in the alley, we lit a small cannon, and the man approached and thrown out. And then ran, behind the firecracker rang, and he heard the man screaming. We ran with a smile and ran all the way to the dry noodles alley. Lack of virtue? It's a little bit. In order not to be caught, we also used the 'shot for a place' tactic in the movie at that time. At that time there was no nightlife in Beijing, few people were returning for overtime, and after the sun went down, there were fewer pedestrians. \\nOur firecrackers may not have frightened many pedestrians, but the frightened areas cover several alley. These bad things like this are naturally a secret between us and our big brother. Romicang Street, east exit of Shijia Hutong, only bus 24. The bus goes between Dongzhimen and Beijing station, but after Romicang, to Dongzongbu Hutong, the 24 road becomes a ring line, passengers are easily confused. The road at the exit of the Beijing railway station is very large, shops are close to the road, some places have no sidewalk, so the bus travels to this period and bumpy and shake. In the early years, the driver's seat of the Beijing bus drummed a big iron bag, the bag was an engine. There is no heating in the car in winter, the engine bag will be wrapped in a layer of quilt to keep warm. When I was a child, I liked to stand on the front, put my hands on a cotton drum bag for heating, warm engines. Although the street is narrow and uneven, Romicang Street shops are more than the east exit of the alley, the larger side food store is 'two stores'. \\nOnce in the winter, the 'two shop' will hang a cotton curtain, the side of the door is quickly rubbed black a large piece of hands. Cotton curtain is very heavy, children don't have to lift up. Wangfujing Department Store was also hanging such curtains, too dirty, but afterwards it was bright and warm, while the second shop was always dark and dark, and very cold. Whether summer and winter, whether spring and autumn, as long as sunny, residents in the alley or carry a bunch of cabbage or a bunch of onions, or hold a bunch of meat or a few pieces of tofu, while walking and greeting: 'His aunt, bought something?' 'His uncle, two shop has come tofu, go.' At that time, the store sells tofu is placed in a drawer, a small store can divide up to two or three drawer, sold out. Sometimes fried dishes under the pot, found that the home oil is less salt, adults are poor children to buy. It doesn't mean to buy salt, play soy sauce a little meaning. \\nAt that time, there were two kinds of soy sauce, a corner of five pounds of general soy sauce, special soy sauce two corners of six pounds, pay attention to the former kind of fried dish, the latter kind of mixed dish, so can not be mistaken. Most of the soy sauce is a pound and a half bottled, soy sauce is best replaced with an empty bottle, but also a single bottle of money. At that time, mainland China's grain, side food and meat were supplied on a monthly basis and purchased with a purchase book or ticket. Side food quantitative oil, sugar, sesame sauce, fans, eggs, etc., the beginning of the month or the end of the month is often the culmination of shopping. Buying at the beginning of the month is generally waiting to eat, such as cooking oil, the end of the month is afraid of obsolete, such as fans often drag to buy until the end of the month. When shopping, people put bottles in plastic nets or vegetable blue seeds, this is oiled, that is sesame sauce, don't forget to bring a copy of the side food. \\nFor urban residents, copies of food, grain books, household books are the lifeline of the whole family. In addition to food stamps, they also need to have food copies. In the 'two shop', see the counter in front of the counter, neighborhood lined up, chat. When it's your turn, laugh or accompany the salesman. When buying eggs, the salesman put the eggs one by one on a box with holes, the size of the hole is in line with the egg, and then open the box light light, bright is 'good egg'. When unhappy about fake goods, there was no 'bad guy' when most, but in order to reassure the buyer, still have to follow one look. I like to go to the store to play sesame sauce. \\nDifferent containers loaded with hemp sauce, bottle size is different, salesman should first scale the container brought by customers, and then according to the quantity on the purchase, plus the weight of the bottle, and then put the scale to a certain position, such as the quantity is three or two, scales generally dial more than three or two. Then, the salesman picked up the spoon of sesame sauce in the tank, and then the spoon with hemp sauce raised high, facing the bottle mouth, very thick hemp sauce down the spoon, forming a light brown thin line, slowly flowing into the bottle. As the weight of the incoming hemp sauce increases, the weighing bar slowly rises, at this time, the salesman to constantly rotate the spoon, control the flow of hemp sauce, and ready to cut the flow of hemp sauce at any time. This is a hand of hard work, bad hemp sauce will fall on the weighing pan, or give over the amount. I always stared at the magical spoon, staring at, and listening to her using Kyo film to say, 'Look, three or two more, not short of you.' Admire, I am somewhat discouraged. If she was not so 'oil practice', I might still be able to rub a little bit of hemp sauce, anyway has been in my bottle, she won't get back again. \\nAfter playing sesame sauce, on the way home, I wipe with my fingers on the mouth of the sesame sauce, while walking and eating, really fragrant! At that time, our children's petty money was calculated in points, three cents, a bunch of red hills, three or five popsicles. Once my cousin got six yuan under the age of money, he also went to the bank to officially open an account. Later even the profit, he got six yuan two points, happy with the lotto. The author and the old babysitter took a photo of my old babysitter very pampering me, she often bought chocolate from two stores. Chocolate at the time belonged to senior sweets, a piece of silver paper in the counter, how could you also have a dollar up and down, and the monthly salary of the old babysitter is ten yuan, right? She barely spent a penny herself, but had to spend more money to buy me a piece of sugar. Sometimes, in order not to let others know, she always bought it in advance, secretly stuffed me in the alley, and whispered, 'Eat outside. Don't let people see.' That piece of chocolate resting in her pocket, soft because of body temperature, I took it, quickly put in the pocket, hand stretched into the pocket, cleverly peel the sugar paper, break down a small piece of paper, and then remove the top of the tin paper, stuffed into the mouth, sweetness in the heart a little localized open. \\nThe old babysitter was less than fifty years old, but in my eyes she was old. Listening to the family, her husband was caught, and the only child died of measles. She first helped my grandfather's family in Sichuan, and later came to Beijing with my parents. After I went to kindergarten, she gave the rest of my mother's unit as a babysitter. After leaving my house, she married a Beijing-native cook, and I remember the fragment of her wedding-people in the new house forced the newlyweds to eat grapes together. But soon after marriage, the man beat her, they divorced, and she continued to help. Old babysitter is illiterate, very honest, very short, probably only one meter or three. She didn't seem to be very lizzy, and I remember my mother often complained. \\nAt the age of four to five, a babysitter who was also from Sichuan to Beijing said he wanted to go back home, and could bring her money back to save. The old babysitter believed, gave the person 200 yuan, the results can be imagined. This thing has always been my mother's talking about her. Count down, but later she borrowed money to people, of course, all borrowed or not paid. Although the old babysitter left my house for years, she has always loved me very much, I have no relatives in Beijing, and when I had to spend a weekend at boarding school, she always wanted to get me home. I have lived in different families, but lived in Zhangjia for the longest time. \\nIn 1965, my mother went to Hunan to participate in the 'Siqing' campaign, left Beijing for more than half a year, and I stayed in Zhangjia during the winter and summer holidays. Homestay, my mother will give me living expenses and give gifts, of course, old babysitters sometimes cause displeasure from employers because they love me. In 1969, many authorities in Beijing went to the dry school. We are no exception. The old babysitting domestic servant moved to Henan, and the house was recovered by the unit. Shijia Hutong Street arranged a western room for her in Dongluo Circle. The room is small and can only have a double bed, a dining table and a stove. The old nanny has no culture, no work, no loved ones and no source of life, so my mother sent her 10 yuan a month from the Northeast. She relied on this money, and others took over three or five years. At that time, I had grown up and knew the amount of 10 yuan of money, and then thought about those chocolates eaten as a child, to understand how much she saved, how much she loved me, and therefore thought that she was cheated away and how big a sum of money! \\nWhen the old babysitter died, I had gone abroad and was sent to death by another child, Wang Weiping, who was brought to the end. In 2014, I returned to the Shijia Alley, remembering her short walk from the depths of the alleys, limping to me. She figured out a piece of chocolate from the blue coat, and that piece of sugar had been softened due to body temperature. Looking back in life, there is always a good man in the world who loves me without seeking return. \\n2/ From the old babysitter helper's East Luo circle, go west is Shijia Hutong 57. There was my aunt, old man of public welfare (1893-1967). About 1960, cousin Kang and completed the university in Chengdu, came to Beijing to visit his grandfather. Cousin has heart, mindful that my father is not around, pick me up to the happy grandfather's family to live with. [Big cousin early 1980s in Hong Kong]\\nThis is a courtyard, into the black narrow door, over the doorway to see bluestone pavilion, flower blooming. Peking people like to plant pomegranates, there are 'ceiling fish tank pomegranate trees, Mr. fat dog girl' said. Kang's family is not Peking, and the pomegranate is probably planted by landlord or neighbor. This yard is not large, there are only two families. Kang family rented a North house, south house with a doctor. Grandpa Kang's family is a living room, living room on both sides are small living room and study, after grandpa kang's bedroom in the study, I and my cousin live in the living room. Such a living environment and Kang's residence in Sichuan can be said to be different. In 'My guide man Zhou Enlai,' writes Ms. Kandesha, two daughter of the heart, 'My family is a representative of Sichuan's influential national bourgeoisie. My great uncle Kangfu (1884-1917), is an Allied member of the Old Confederate, and the Kuomintang veteran was hometown to the right. He was a professor at Peking University, and Li Dazhao was also very good. My second uncle is the chairman and general manager of Sichuan Meifeng Bank. My father was happy to manage factories, mines, real estate and finance, and also ran the National Gazette. My four uncle Kangxin is the general manager of Baofeng company. 'My family has many contacts with many Party and political leaders, as well as local power and democrats.' \\nBefore 1949, Kang had not only buildings, mountains, banks, mines. If you speak of Kang's influence at the time, it is not three words or two words, I can only add to Aunt Dai Sha's memories. Since then, the Cang Brothers have had a lot of interaction with people of the times and were involved in history to a certain extent. 'From 1913 to 1916, Zhang Taiyan was placed under house arrest in Beijing Qianliang Hutong by Yuan Shikai,' recalls in his legacy 'Zhang's Book Series'. Yumei from Shanghai to Beijing please. Division wants to book book book books, Yu generously promised the responsibility of printing, the rest of Shanghai set up right in the book publishing industry, so dare to do so. After returning to Shanghai, imitation Deng Qiumei (real), printed the wind and rain floor book format, arranged into a sample, with Beijing audited, the division greatly appreciated. Jinwaru, call for the lesbian, hurry to the desk, cover makeup will also be out. Division has a displeasure color. It is a late self-death, and it is always unclear what is. The teacher's 'dead woman'... complete about a year more than a year. It is divided into twenty-four volumes. (Zhang too Yan long female chapter in the evening of September 7, 915, happy as the original '', this is a mistake. (It is said that Zhang women gamble with her father's money, gambling lost and unable to account for themselves.), \\n[Author and Condesa and Kambacon in 2004] If he was designated by the National Government as Speaker of the Chongqing Senate during the war of resistance, the term 'accompany' was said to have been invented by him. Grandpa happy personality, wealth, good communication, known as 'Meng Tajun'. According to my big cousin, Grandpa Kang's teaching to the younger generations is: 'If you borrow money, you don't think of returning money, it is an accident. Otherwise you will be a villain, simply do not borrow.' During the war of resistance, the Chinese Communist Party was very difficult in its economy, and Kang Jia had donated. Mr. Zhang Zige, former English secretary of Song Meiling, recalled that Kang had delivered seven trucks of medicine and cloths to Yan'an, Shaanxi North Yan'an ('Brotherhood of Good Heart', Zhang Zige wrote 'X Individual and Three Livestock'. In addition to this, Kang Jia also funded the school in North Shaanxi and donated Mao Zedong cigarettes. Consul Lane on the 10th of Consul Lane in Chongqing was a temporary residence for the Right Ren and Shao Lizi. Zhou Enlai is a regular meeting place with democratic people. (Large-scale television documentary 'Zhou Enlai', episode 1, 'The Journey'). \\nThe History of the Communist Party of China, published in 2006, also mentions that Zhou Enlai has three friends in Sichuan: Lu Zuofu, Beard Aung and Healthy. Conscious second woman, Kandesha, participated in the Communist Party led revolution in 1938. After doing a lot of secret work for the Communist Party in Chongqing. On two occasions, letters of intimidation were received from agents and then abducted and held in prison. My grandfather, Li Zhaofu (Bosun), released her from jail on bail for his own life. She married Chen Shuliang in Yan'an in 1946. Her main marriage was Ye Jianying. In the 1960s, Chen Shuliang became the ambassador of the Chinese Communist Party to Cambodia and Romania. \\nChongqing mountainous, consul lane visitors a lot of people, the maid had to rattle from the mountain to the mountain when opening dinner. Later because there were too many guests, happy to build a two-storey building next to the main building, Shao Lizi a parent lived there. My other cousin list called 'Association' was given by Mr. Shao Lizi, meaning 'the People's CPPCC'. The Kang brothers also had a good deal with Zhang Jiluan (March 20, 1888-September 6, 1941, the Republic of China famous newspaper and politician), and co-sponsored the newspaper. Prior to Zhang's death, he lived in Kang's villa. The villa is located on Wangshan on the south bank of Chongqing. In addition to Kang's villa, there is also a villa in Chiang Kai-shek. Once, the happy young child Kang Guoxiong met Chiang Kai-shek on the mountain road. Jiang likes the children, took him for a walk, and later he went to Chiang's villa to play. [The former residence of Kangjia Consul Lane, the author filmed in Chongqing in 2009]\\nIn 1950, Kangxin donated Consul Lane 10th and Coal Mine to the government and moved his family to Beijing. In 1956, the healthy elected members of the CPPCC, 'to receive income enough to live, to send 200 yuan a month to the CPPCC euphemeral rejection, saving the country by little bit.' In the Cultural Revolution, it was a crime for him, because it was the proceeds of exploitation. I heard the sound of crisp pieces in the living room soon after I arrived at Kang's home that summer. The bamboo curtain that leads to the living room was covered with a piece of cloth, but it was not stiffened, I saw the feet wearing cloth shoes from the curtain. In the voice of the pieces, or hear some short words, such as 'mention', 'punch', etc. But I didn't understand it, and then knew it was all Go terms. \\nThis is my first impression of the old man of good conscience. The next day to celebrate his cousin attending college, Grandpa Kang banquets at the Peace Restaurant. That was the first time I had Western food, white tablecloths, a long table person, I came with the cousin, 'aunt father', 'uncle and aunt.' Grandpa Kang sat at the chief, he was not high, but very majestic. I don't remember what I ate at all, just carved glass cups and napkins. At first I thought that the napkins with flowers could eat too. After dinner, Aunt Daisha's little sister and little dian brother also followed. They play poker and teach me how to play. Later this was known to my mother, she said, 'Let me know you play cards later, and I'll cut your hand off.' From then on to adulthood, I rarely touch solitaire, and my gaming intelligence is completely undeveloped. Grandpa Kang meticulously laughs,More than the following Go to spend time,And only two or three regular guests to play chess。 Even his family reunion on New Year's Eve, he was not very much talking to the children, it was hard to imagine that year guests Yingmen Meng Taijun style. \\nThen I learned that in 1957, six of the three Conds were beaten into the right. Of the three sons and three daughters of the heart, in addition to the eldest daughter of the United States Kang Chang, known as the 'red ambassador', the second daughter of Kang Dysha, still young Kang Guoqi, the other three failed to escape a robbery: my big uncle Kang Guojian, Kang Guojian's brother-in-law financier Gam Bacon, three son Kang Guojun. Kang Guojie, the eldest son of the good heart, the happy grandson, Convoy Road, is classified as the right, and good as myself is classified as the extreme right. [Summer 1960 in Summer Palace, front right as big cousin, first author]\\nAlthough Kang Family is no longer a guest. But Grandpa Kang is still a chivalrous heart. Uncle Gambacon's sister had six sons (two of whom were twins), who were eating 'long' meals at the time of the Holodomor 1959 to 1962. At that time, not only was the food quantification not enough, but could not buy anything even if there was money. With the 'privileges' of members of the CPPCC National Committee of the People's Political Consultative Conference, the family will be invited to have a meal in Sichuan hotels, restaurants of European and American Associations or the CPPCC auditorium over the month. When eating, Grandpa Kang himself does not eat much, and it is mostly watching the children eat. Aunt Gan said that without such support, the children were likely to be malnourished in the future. \\nAt the beginning of Beijing, Kang Yuan with Mrs. Wu Yulan was still alive. Wu mother-in-law is everyone's show, good painting. In Consul Lane, Kang's own dishes and spoons are custom made, while the orchids painted on the tableware are from the hands of Wu Po Po. At that time, Wu mother-in-law was old. He was another woman who presided over housework. We called her 'Grandma'. At that time she was less than 50 years old, her skin was white, her lips were bright red, dressed with eyebrows. I probably saw a plain woman in Lenin uniform, and the first time I met her, I felt strange. She loves to laugh, like to speak, speak very cool, burn a good dish, quite able to make a piece with our little children. But since I went to school, I was instilled with a thought, and when I met again, I gave her a 'bourgeois' label in my heart. Later, the elders at home mentioned that she was the little wife of Grandpa Kang, and for some time even compared her with the demonized 'little wife of landlord'. \\nAt the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Kang family was copied five times. Grandpa Kang, who was 73 years old, was pulled to the neighborhood to fight and fined the street sweeping. But Grandma was not criticized. Later I learned that her surname, Tang, was originally the girl of the poor, because of her bitter origin, and young, dare to dare for a man. When Grandpa Kang was fined to sweeping the street, she often appeared in place. Family, batter, street sweeping, blow a great deal on the old man who has a strong and good face throughout his life. Soon Grandpa Kang was hemiplegia. After hemiplegia, red guards still harassed, and grandpa Kang had to move to Aunt Conley's home. Aunt Li not only had a narrow house, but her husband, Kambacon, was ill and disabled during the right. This family is a rugged one."},

[Conscious and grandchildren living in Shijia Hutong]\\nIn the Cultural Revolution, the big cousin was allotted to Shaanxi and lost contact with grandpa. In January 1968, she came to Beijing to visit her grandpa, and in order to surprise her, deliberately wearing masks and headscarves. Door 57 was opened, but was told that his grandfather had died at the end of 1967. Grandpa Kang died shortly. Grandma was rushed to the leaking kitchen, where she lived for several years. At that time, the families were hard to protect themselves. My mother went to school in 1969 after being dictatorship by the masses in 1967, and we also stopped questioning with Kang. Many years later, I learned that when my old babysitter was the most difficult time, the grandmother who I thought to be 'landlord' had sent her furniture, clothing and money to her. Every time I sent my cousin. \\n'She is a poor farmer, I can not go personally, lest I see her tired in the streets,' said her mother. Later, my old babysitter moved into the nursing home, and my wife also moved out of Shijia Alley. When they died, the big cousin, cousin and I were all in North America. About 2004, cousin went to Shijia Hutong when he returned to Beijing. He said: 'The 57 is still, but it is completely impossible to recognize. The gate has changed in the direction, and the roof grows very tall grass. It's just a house number, and you don't have to go back.' After another ten years, I returned to Beijing. Walk to the mouth of the dry face alley and see a French architectural guesthouse (or apartment). This building is quite large, has continued to Shijia Hutong mouth, the hutong mouth is also widened. The original residents have been relocated, right? But why is this building uninhabited yet? Hutong mouth, walk east soon to see Shijia Hutong primary school. Soon go through the hostel of the People's Art Theatre. I don't know if I remember mistakes, or built a lot of houses inside, this yard seems narrow. Walk and see a courtyard gate written on the Shijia Hutong Museum. After going in, the manager said it was going to close the door, and you come back tomorrow. I took advantage of him, rushed through the introduction, roughly a certain yard who lived. The museum continued to go east, and the housing in the north of the alley was mostly preserved, but most of the courtyard on the south side disappeared, even if the reservation turned into small shops. I remember the south of the House of Good Heart, the house number 57, but now 57 is marked north, which makes me very confused. \\nFurther to the east, has been walking to the Dongluo Hutong. This alley did not change,Probably not on the face,There is nothing to shame,So not among the city transformation。 My old babysitter lived in the first small courtyard in this alley, and was admitted to the hospital was a public faucet, the yard was basically unchanged. I remember the old babysitter lived in the first room on the left, very small, probably a double bed and a snack table. The door was open, and I looked inside, still so small, but lived in a family and looked like a field. Several people in the yard stare at me with suspicion, I explained that I've lived here before and come back and see. Out of the East Luo circle, and then turn back to Shijia Hutong, I still can't find Kang's old house. One of the courtyards is generally right, but the house plate is still wrong. I'm not willing to go into that yard gate, walk along the gable gate, I look forward to seeing the kind of pomegranate yard, but I don't want the yard to slap a little big, where to grow pomegranate. Look again, find that it has been split by another gable, but where is the door in that gable?

The 'joint struggle' method created by the CPC Xi'an Municipal Committee provides experience and has achieved great results. \\nWhen the anti-right struggle began, four right-wing elements were found in the 11 departments (committees), of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party Committee of the Communist Party Committee, the Organization Department, the Propaganda Department and the Party Committee directly under three departments, while the other eight departments were not exposed. Since these units are led by operational systems, they are not linked to each other. The forces that led to the anti-right struggle of the whole organ appear to be dispersed. At that time, individual departments with right-wing elements were found to be profoundly undermanned and struggling; while others that did not find the right were not educated in lively class struggles, some cadres were still blurred with the anti-right struggle, and even a few suspected that the Ministry had a debilitated view of the right. The material is fully sorted out. \\nIn order to overcome these shortcomings, the party organization of the CPC Xi'an Municipal Committee decided to set up an interim leadership group for the anti-right struggle to determine unity of command and joint combat. The method of combat is to first change the method of decentralized leadership within the organs and to form a unified combat unit. Then, with the right, the ministry (committee), as the unit of the right, and check all the facts with the right-wing elements. The number of joint struggles congresses and the departments to participate are then determined, depending on the specific situation of the right-wing elements. The materials of right-wing elements preparing for the struggle were distributed to each cadre in each ministry (committee), before the meeting by the leading group, and organized the various ministries (committees), for two or three separate discussions and criticism within this unit. In this way, many cadres who did not originally have a right-wing division have clarified the obscure ideas of the past after knowing the ugly faces of the right-wing elements. Proactively draw boundaries with right-wing elements and actively engaged in anti-right struggles. \\nThe Ministry of Rural Work and the Ministry of Culture and Education, in order to refute the reactionary rhetoric of right-wing elements of the Organization Ministry, have also sent cadres to go deep into rural areas and higher schools to collect materials. More than 100 cadres from other ministries have prepared joint statements on the different arguments of the right-wing elements, respectively. After more than a week of full preparation, the entire organ convened a general meeting of more than 500 participants and invited representatives of other relevant municipal bodies. At the meeting, more than 40 people from various departments spoke continuously and focused on criticizing the fallacy of the right-wing elements. Due to the abundance of material and solid facts revealed, the rightists of the rightists were fuelled even more by the slightest and cunning resistance of the right-wing elements. Under the steps of the masses, the light had to bow down to confess guilt and admit that he had taken his mouth. \\nAs a result of a 'joint struggle' against several right-wing elements, the cooperation between departments has been strengthened, and all cadres have been educated and trained. The right-wing elements were completely isolated among the people in the organs. Many people who used to sympathize with right-wing elements are now actively involved in the struggle. A right-wing party who was determined not to wear a 'right' hat in the past, also proactively admitted that he was the right, and also reported another right-wing. A right-wing activist who is ready to recalcitrate has also expressed himself that he wants to surrender arms to the people. In the past, the United Front Department, Office and other departments, which did not find the right-wing elements, many cadres have also revealed the reactionary remarks of other right-wing elements to the leadership group. Due to the close cooperation of the various departments, four more hidden right-wing elements are now revealed. At present, this experience of 'joint struggle' has been implemented in some units at the municipal level in Xi'an. (People's Daily 1957.9.1)"}

I learned a set of techniques for Fei Xiaotong to 'work intellectuals' in Chengdu last year. I caught the issue of the relationship between the party and intellectuals to attack the party. I described the leadership of the Party and a large number of intellectuals as opposing the two main existence. In meetings and individual conversations within and outside the League, I threatened that the party did not understand the characteristics, mood and work of intellectuals, and therefore the relationship was tense. In conjunction with Pan Dakui's conveying the inflammatory report of the working session, I attacked the branch and the group The provincial committee decided to run an engineering department at the School of Finance and Economics, and I did not understand the complexity of the school's work. I was instructed by Fei Xiaotong's letter. Attacks Some people say that the requirement to study business is a manifestation of dissociation from politics is not understanding the mood and labor of the intellectuals. I seize individual party members who used to be unclear in the past with democratic parties said to be that the party did not have a united war policy ideological education, I said with frustration that people have done work, hard, sweating, having a body in the past few years Meeting with insights, they should have a say, and I inadvertently say that party members are walking downhill, to educate people to self-occupy, etc. The intentions and results of these renditions are to provoke popular grievances and antagonism and even confrontation against the party, playing a political reactionary role. \\nKang Zhen-Huang said: The method of buying is used by the right. After Fei Xiaotong went to Chengdu last year to touch the bottom of some intellectuals, I also applied the same trick to me. He knew that I complained that the talents of the Southwest were not known to the outside, especially in his writing 'The Early Spring Weather of Intellectuals', which gave me a sense of knowledge. This year at the NLD Central Cultural and Educational Colloquium, the cost of raising the intellectuals's current demands is to improve business rather than to change ideas, and encouraged me to speak, to introduce that I came from the grassroots from the actual work, and from the southwest, where I was treated as a debilitating treatment. I took the floor at that time, and mistakenly, that socialist business would not lead to political disengagement, and cited as an example a teacher who was more interested in nation-building because of scientific research in engineering. Fei Xiaotong not only appreciated and supported my statement on the spot, but later sent a letter asking me to write this meaning into an article. In fact, Fei Xiaotong did this by using the mistakes I spoke at that time to support his argument of abolishing the intellectuals' ideological transformation, which led me to look for him and expand the reactionary role, and on the other hand to seize the root nature of my good outburst and show his appreciation and promotion of me to further become fascinated. I wrote the article at his request, but it was not published later. This is the case for the right to recruit troops to buy horses and correct the forces.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】Zhao Yiheng: 'Study abroad and send off the future of Kang baiqing Bai love'\\nThe popularity of Peking University has risen, of course, since the May 4 era; among the Peking University students, several particularly active leaders appeared, from Sichuan poet Kang baiqing Bai love as one of them. \\nWhen Shang is a North University student, Kang baiqing Bai love's poems have enjoyed famous. Compared with Hu Shi, Liu Bannong, Shen Yin Mo, Zhou Zuoren and others, a distinct feature is that Kang baiqing Bai love is written poems by poets. Others (mostly teachers of Kang baiqing Bai love), are only in the most difficult genre of poems 'Experiment' is only modern Chinese, the traces of the old body song too deu. Although 'Grass' (published in 1922, the Yadong Library was renamed 'Grass in the Front'), in 117, all in the Peking University study stage, as well as on the way to study abroad, too much hasty. But Kang baiqing Bai's poet temperament is also very eye-catching. Admittedly, the real beginning of modern Chinese poetry will wait for Guo Moruo's 'goddess', but Guo Moruo himself said, 'The real white poem I saw for the first time was Kang baiqing white love,' 'actually surprised and evoked my guts.' In 1922, Hu Shi met Puyi in the deep palace, saw that the stepped down emperor actually read the poem of Kang baiqing Bai love, greatly moved, and encouraged many parties. Later Puyi also wrote several new poems, learning the Kang baiqing Bai style. \\nKang baiqing Bai love wrote a draft for 'trendy', almost a poem, he can be said to be a 'trendy' poet, the first Peking University poet, and the first young poet in the May Fourth Era. At the same time, he is a social activist who has published some political articles in 'Trendy', with vigor and courage. \\nIn 1917, Peking University first used students to preside over the Professor Council. Four student leaders-Fu Si Nian, Luo Jialun, Zhang Guotao and Kang baiqing Bai Yi-served as the directors of the four colleges. \\nIn 1918, 'Trendy' was founded, Kang baiqing Bai Ying is an officer. 'Trendy' became the first student publication in the country. Kang baiqing Bai love is a Chinese Chinese society of young people, more active. \\nOn the night of May 3, 1919, after the Peking University Student Congress decided to march the next day, Chancellor Cai Yuanpei called five student leaders for planning. The 'five leaders' at this critical juncture are Fu Si Nian, Luo Jialun, Xu Deheng, Duan Ximing and Kang baiqing Bai love. After the May Fourth incident received a national response, Kang baiqing Bai Led a delegation of Beijing students to Shanghai and was elected President of the National Student Federation. \\nIn 1920, the best of the May Fourth Youth went abroad. And Kang baiqing's white love abroad is even more extraordinary-it is Cai Yuanpei's money raised from Nanyang Tobacco Company to personally select several of the most talented people of this year's Peking University graduates to study in the United States. Kang baiqing Bai love and Duan Xipeng, Luo Jialun and others, were sent by newspapers to examine the Constitution 'five ministers out of the ocean' than for the late Qing Dynasty. \\nThere are many poems on the trans-Pacific boat journey, emotional excitement, a change of 'grass' early love poems lingering wind, to the United States after the 'grass' writing order assembly, presume to be a golden basin wash hands, no more poet, and do a more great cause. Kang baiqing went to the United States, admitted to the University of California Berkeley, studied 'Recent Social Transformation Doctrine', and also worked for part-time work, translation and other subsidized petty money routine. \\nHowever, he is in China's domestic politics, so he keeps in touch with people such as Zhang Wentian, Yuan Tongli, Fang Zhimei and others in the United States to discuss politics. He liaised with the Communist Party of Japan through Japan to the United States and with the US Communist Party, and finally found another political force in San Francisco: the San Francisco Torrent Club, which allowed him to find a chance to realize his political ambitions. His family, Anyue, Sichuan, is one of the power centers of Sichuan Paao, and he is 11 years old, 'participated' in the club. After coming to California to join the San Francisco Hongmen Zhi Public Hall. In July 1923, several Chinese students joined the University of California, launched a new political party 'New China Party', at which time Kang baiqing was 28 years old, turned to become a 'party leader', and immediately set up a party in Chinatown across the West, Beijing and other places Department. And four out to pull international students from various countries, such as Li Gili people who have just arrived in France to join. This 'political party' based on a gangs-based 'party' is a momentous moment. Kang baiqing Bai is returning to the country as a leader to 'mentor', leaving four years of study at the University of California outside the sky. However, since this 'political party' is based on overseas Chinese, Kang baiqing Bai is returning home, it collapses down. \\nLiving abroad, it should be said, is a critical moment in the development of a person's career, whether academic or not. The so-called 'gilt', that is. From the brilliant college period of Kang baiqing Bai, he could choose between literary and social activities, because he did both well. However, both modern cultural and political circles in China are in their infancy, creating opportunities for talented and ambitious people to stand out, but also to some young people who are actually inexperienced without reading, looking for guidance, and not having to strengthen their training, they can pack the world's false images. \\nAt Peking University, the arrogance of Kang baiqing Bai has become famous. Every time classes are attended, as usual, late. He attended Mr. Masulun's 'Philosophy of Old Trang' class, not once without being late. One day, when Mathulun is talking about the rise, Kang baiqing Bai and push the door into, the whole class student's vision of production and turn to Kang baiqing. This time, Masulun could not help but ask Kang baiqing Bai why it was late. The poet answered, 'Live too far.' Mr. Ma said angrily, 'Don't you live in the Cuihua Alley? Just a road apart, three or five minutes to walk, why is it far!' The poet immediately said, 'Is not Mr. Zhuang Zi? Zhuang Zi said, 'One is wrong, and this is the right. ' Mr. not think far, and I think far.' Mathulun is talking about the 'white horse horse' there, and Kang baiqing Bai is rewarded with sophism. Mr. Gidma had nothing to say, and had to announce the end of class. \\nOf course, there were many students studying abroad in domestic politics, and reunited like-minded people. For example, in 1923, Tsinghua students at the University of Chicago, Luolongji, smelled more and more, promoted 'nalisnalism', organized a 'great river meeting', attended by Pu Xue Feng, He Haoruo and Wu Zelin. There are so many organizations of a kind of club nature, and there is no such ambition as Kang baiqing Bai. \\nAdmittedly, many foreign students from the May 4 era, entered political activities after returning home, and leaders of North University students studying at the same time as Kang baiqing, almost all of them became political figures. However, Kang baiqing Bai feels like studying abroad as the beginning of a political career, and it seems that no political force can take advantage of it. Such an example, it seems only this one person. \\nNote that the May Fourth Movement is not a political event by students demonstrating, but a cultural movement promoted by the professors. These students, especially in foreign countries, seem to be singled out in the world, but they still have to develop under the wings of their former mentors after returning home. Of the five leaders, Cai Yuanpei helped stay in law Xu Deheng later joined the third party and the Democratic Party. At that time, Zhang Guotao, who did not go abroad, became Li's main assistant. Xi Peng has always been a KMT political worker. Luo Jialun became an academic officer of the Kuomintang. Only Fu Si Year belongs to the KMT, but He maintained a certain degree of academic independence. Kang baiqing Bai's overly developed leader's desire has caused him to lose his former teacher figures Cai Yuanpei, Zeng Qi and Li Dazhao, and so on, and the 'New China Party' has also been dispersed. \\nAfter the disappearance of 'his own political party', Kang baiqing Bai can neither return to the United States to continue his studies, nor can it work north. He can only return to his home in Sichuan, who cast warlord Liu Xiang as the shogunate. At this time, he was infected with tobacco addictions, as an official, doing business, and literary. In the forties, he was taught in the Chinese Department of South China Normal University in Guangzhou, and became a right-wing member in 1958, retired from home. On the way, he died in Padang, Hubei, before entering the Three Gorges. \\nThe mainland intellectuals who were unfortunately wearing the 'right-wing hat' are more sympathetic. Kang baiqing Bai died directly because of the anti-right incident, but never saw anyone to mention it. In addition to literary history written to early new poems, it will be mentioned, some of the words like Kang baiqing Bai, just saying that he 'thoughts are falling behind after his return,' the fact is not so simple. Instead, Mao Zedong himself, may have seen this high-spirited poet at the editorial department of the Peking University Library, so he waved Kang baiqing's strange hat: 'Participated in the Three K Party in the United States.' In his life, Kang baiqing Bai was overwhelmed. In the end, he criticized a country's only Western crime, and finally fell out of fame. \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 3"}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached 1】Ke jiahua Jiahua: 'Meditation in front of Hu Shi'\\nIn June 2008, Professor Cai Houyan came to Jixi to lecture, after accompany to Hu Shi's former residence, accompanied by Cai Zhijiao and the CST Office staff here, in front of Hu Shi statue three bow ceremony. Only Prof. Cai added a bow to pay tribute after apology. Gaiqi participated in his 'big criticism' of Hu Shi during his studies at the Peking University. Obviously, that year, it was only certain that the old man who was more than eighty years old had expressed repentance for the past of young ignorance and bewitched. Although it is a 'recognition of late', it is also very valuable in our country without Thanksgiving or repentance. In particular, at a particular stage in history, Lin Zhao, who was unprovoked deprived of his right to life on the Peking University campus, has not yet been brought to justice. Professor Cai's move caused us enough shock. Open my dustless past, our family and this cultural giant-Xiang Xian Hu Shirong and common past. \\nHu Shi he lifelong promotion of 'De, Sai', is a modern version of the burglers-Prometheus. Illuminated the darkness of the autocratic dynasty, promoted white words, carried out a series of educational reforms, cultivated a large number of productive talents, benefiting every Chinese national, once a star of the nation (even the 'founding king' became his fan). Our family was a fortune with him and made many charitable causes for him in his hometown. It is difficult to predict that a series of criticism of Hu Shi after the founding of the country has affected us. \\nHu Shi, as a representative of modern intellectuals, was also a model figure that was once highly appreciated by the 'Founding King'. But after the 'founding', with the power of the monarchy, many intellectuals have become obstacles to his policies of fool people. Thus Hu Shi was criticized by the 'Eight Corps' led by the president of the Academy of Sciences for millions of words nationwide. A weak old man can only die overseas, but still does not lose the dignity of his 'taxis', does not receive a 'green card', live his helpless apartment life. His youngest son, named after Nobel laureate Dewey, 'Houstu', was unable to escape the 1957 'anti-right' disaster. Although he spoke at the study group organized by the Tang Railway Institute, he said that his statement could be published in the media in Hong Kong at that time. Who could have so tolerated his will? \\nWhy does Hu Shing cause such hatred and fear? A famous scholar pointed out that Hu Shi's 'independent thought, freedom spirit', 're-suspicion and re-proof' are irreconcilable with the policy of foolish people. This is also the main reason for launching a wave of campaigns, especially against Hu Shi and the intellectuals who represent, after 'opening the country'. Fans of Hu Shih and other intellectuals underwent a 180-degree shift, in response to Sidzhe's words: 'Power makes people corrupt, absolute power makes people absolutely corrupt.' \\nThe dust of nearly half a century of past, in Hu Shi appeared before. It is family and state affair: that is, Hu Shi and our family experience, but also reflects the twists and turns of our country and the suffering of the people. Looking back, but only memories can cause the role of 'history as an insight'. \\nMy family originally and Hu Shijia only a bridge between Ruichuan, now belong to Shangzhuang town, and Hu Shi have a world friendship. My family medical practitioner, ancestors are charitable, and every poor patient can not pay for medicine, then pay for his pending bill. With a slight balance, the National School, the Cultivation School, provides free access to needy villagers. When his ancestors died in 1922, Hu Shi was inscribed: 'Mr. Zezhou, Wen Wen kiss, friend of the sick, a hometown of a hometown for ten years, eternal life and death, the statue of the king, desolate.' First uncle Ke jiahua Xiangfan young children after school hanging pot in Shanghai, coaching China Medical College, 1917, when Hu Shi married, with friends to swim the tomb of Wei, among them there is the first uncle. \\nHis father Ke jiahua Xinlu young courtroom training, after fundraising to Shanghai East Asian Medical University, hi public welfare activities, amateur to participate in Huining hometown association (NGO), run the 'microtone' monthly magazine, care about the construction of hometown culture and education, stirring society darkness. Hu Shi and Tao Xingzhi, as advisers to the journal, have a great impact. Later returned home to serve Mulberry Zi, became the first new clinic, the first to use antimicrobials, and called on overseas colleagues to donate to buy penicillin to first aid the epidemic meningitis that was prevalent at the time. \\nDuring the War of Anti-Japanese War, his father served as a military doctor at the 92 BTS Hospital and served as an anti-Japanese child. After the victory of anti-Japanese resistance, local Senate elections were held, and their father was elected as county senators with reputation. From the existing files, it is still 'drumming and appealing' for the local people, such as asking the government to cut taxes for the failure to collect rent and improve the treatment of postal workers. The competition for election representatives is still very fierce. NCP deputies, Hu Zhongwu, who were elected by senators, faced with Chiang Kai-shek's request to remain in government at the meeting. This is far from later talking about vase decorations. \\nIn 1947, my county (CPC), underground party struggles fierce with the authorities. Dozens of people in the assembly mountain old district were arrested. His father was commissioned by the local masses, who went to Jiangcun to use his status for bail, and was then prosecuted by the Kuomintang, which was contained in the Huizhou newspaper at the time. So escape from your hometown away from Shanghai. \\nAt the beginning of the 'liberation', the first father responded to the call to set up the first joint clinic in Shangzhuang, and was also the executive member of the County Medical Association, indicating that the father was able to keep up with the situation. But with the rising voice of Hu Shi, his father's situation worsened, first under social supervision; in 1958 he was sentenced to three years in prison, when he attended medical school, but was replaced by the right on the eve of graduation. It should be explained that at this time the 'anti-right' has ended and entered the heartfelt stage. Because I was enlightened by the hometown of 'Yi Shitu', I gave a correct opinion to the Party that has stood the test so far. Originally in response to Mao Zedong's call for 'the speakers' innocence', they fell into a trap of intertwined 'conspiracy.' It should also be said that the family is indirectly accepted by the family. \\nIn 1962, after the screening of the rehabilitation and rehabilitation, Fang knew that 'father-crime' was actually a false post (military doctor during the anti-Japanese period), had an exchange with Hu Shi. Although Hu Shi was approved and notorious at that time, there was no formal charge at all, wearing a 'hat' openly, and the so-called interaction meant that Hu Shi served the cause of culture and education through his father in his hometown. Construction of a hometown library and assumed the duty of construction of Jixi to Jingdeshan Road only. Guilty against Japan, goodness has ever been, what do you say? At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, my family became more doom, plunged home countless times, dug three feet, many years books and newspapers including Hu Shi, Tao Xingzhi, Xiong Shili, and Lien Shili paid a torch of the medical books stored in Lianmo treasure and Laotian. Legend tyrant Qin Shihuang on medical, agricultural books can still open a side, but modern 'founding king' has truly fulfilled his promise-'to exceed the history of the Qin Shi Emperor 100 times.' \\nAfter the reform and opening-up, with the discussion of 'practice test standards' proposed by Hu Shi, the people of the country broke down the superstition of 'two 'whatsoever' of personal worship, and abandoned the 'class struggle as the platform' and carried out a series of civilizational construction for peaceful development. Hu Shi's knowledge and his writings have gradually become popular in research. Our family's descendants were able to pass the college entrance examination, enter the higher medical university or teach, which in the past was the day. \\nPain to think pain, pains to think more 'cure', our home, such as the suffering of millions of families, is not exactly the need for a good social doctor, is not due to the lack of 'De, Sai' Mr.? Although Hu Shi has brought 'strains' to our family, this leads us to understand that the remedy for the persistent disorder of 'democratic lack' is still 'democracy.' So Hu Shi is one of the best social surgeons, and his lifelong recommended Mr. De and Sai is the best solution for treating autocratic diseases! \\nAlthough the individual retired for many years, approaching the year of his death, but still willing to learn to recommend this good medical treatment, in order to do its best to save the personal and national losses in case. In 1989, Geng Yunzhi, head of modern history of the Academy of Social Sciences, led a group of Hu Shi's colleagues, students and friends including Liang Shuming, Jiang Zehan, Feng Zhiyuan, and others. He published articles that recall Hu Shi in the book 'Hu Shi Research Series' published by Sanlian Publishing House. I also use 'Hu Shi and Hometown' as an entry point to cite Hu Shi's attention to the cultural and educational construction of his hometown, thus proving Hu Shi's love of home country. A scholar of the Academy of Social Sciences wrote 'Reading' as 'opening a new chapter in history.' \\nThe year 2008 coincides with the 50th anniversary of 'anti-right', and the Olympic year of the centenary. I hope that, through personal history, the history of the suffering of the entire country, I hope that the people will not forget the history of suffering that country has suffered. I hope that all Chinese people have professor Cai's feelings of gratitude and confession, play the Olympic spirit and act as a torchbearer of modern Prometheus. Today, in the face of Hu Shi, we remember his lifelong quest for democracy and human rights and embrace the common values he has always sought. Few the same world, the same dream, in order to come true! \\n"},

After the victory of the anti-Japanese war, in addition to serving as the president of Peking University for a short period, he returned to the United States for another 10 years. It can be said that Hu Shi spent half of his life in the United States. \\nFrom a young age, Hu Shi came from the feudal society of closed countries to the vast world of all sorts of European and American bourgeoisies. It is inevitable for the freedom, democracy that Europe and the United States flaundered. The Fourth Movement, Hu Shi, took the lead in holding the flags of 'Mr. De' and 'Mr. Sai' and opened fire on traditional old culture.

For example, when he was a professor at Beiping University in the early years, he was determined not to talk about politics and focus on learning, but he was willing to also serve as the president of Jixi hometown association for 20 years, caring for the welfare of his fellow countrymen. Peers want to save his ink for commemoration, he is happy to meet the requirements, always like 'Jixi hometown' or 'Huizhou hometown' when signing. He later gave the inscription 'Jixi County Zhi' published in Taiwan, 'Efforts to make emblem camels', showing that he placed deep praise and expectation to Huizhou fellow people. \\nHis eating habits are also Huizhou. He has always liked to eat Huizhou pot、。 In the last 10 years of beauty, he also served with Huizhou Lai fried Okara. Perhaps as the saying says, 'beautiful and beautiful village water'! He is in such a pursuit of fashionable ocean world but the curd as a delicious guest, he can see his love of hometown, is old and mundane! \\nBecause Hu Shi does not have the means of an old official field, he does not engage in a vulgar relationship among his family friends and friends, do not write a reference letter (for example: an old babysitter who followed his father for many years, please Hu Shi to introduce his son a more satisfactory job. The principle of Hu's recruitment only helps him in a ink factory (I made a very hard work of ink making), so the hometown thinks he is A wealthy man. In contrast to him, his own brother Hu Zhuolin, doing business in Shanghai, has brought many homelands to Shanghai for employment, so Shangzhuang village has in the past circulated the saying of 'rather a Hu Zhuolin, not ten beats'. \\nIn fact, Hu Shi is affectionate to his hometown, enumerating the facts briefly:\\n(1), Subsidised Shangzhuang Elementary School and Establishment of Hometown Library\\nHu Shi organized the Association to set up a school council to prepare funds for Yuk Ying Primary School, which was formally established in 1928. Hu Shi personally served as the principal of the primary school (honorary position), and personally identified teachers for the school, and since his high salary of 240 yuan, hired Sheshan Bao Jiannu (Nanjing Institute of Education graduated, ancient literature, time, music, sports and fine arts), to teach. When people praise 'big boto' please come to 'Little Ph.D.' And a letter was sent to Hu Jinren, asking him not to teach classes, but only to be responsible for teaching. He also introduced Peking University student Ishihara Gao and my father Ke jiahua Xinlu as faculty. Specific comments were also made on the content of schooling. \\nOn March 8, 1915, he drew up an ideal book building plan, and said: 'After returning home, every place, will provide to build a public library building, in the building of Jixi Book House, Wannan Library Building is about to be built outside... British Museum in the UK... also at the end of the country.' In 1926, Hu Shi and Shanghai Yadong Library Manager Wang Mengzou initiated and donated 3,000 books to set up Jixi Library. In about 1930, Hu Shi also sent to the Shu people Hu Jinren to open a library in Shangzhuang and prepare to donate his property located on the side of Yanglin Bridge for the library site, and that his father was specifically responsible for the construction of the building, after being forced to go north for 'human rights issues', and the situation at home and abroad was unstable. Unsuccessful. \\n(2), Initiatives to establish prefectural Shikan, cemetery\\nIn 1934 Hu Shi wrote an initiative for the compilation of 'Jixi County Chi', and was granted the special editor of 'Jixi County Chi', and also donated his own collection of Wanli, Kangxi, Qianlong County Zhi. \\nIn 1931, Hu Shi, as one of the initiators of Jixi Zhiyuan Cemetery, stated in the initiative 'Cemetery Kai': 'Huizhou is the center of feng shui learning, so the grave is also special attention. The good landscape of Huizhou has been divided by mud gods, puppets and dead people. How much is the benefit of Feng Shui we people in Huizhou?' In the absence of promotion of cremation, he advocated the establishment of a cemetery as a desirable step in the improvement of folklore. \\n(3), Support the establishment of Jixi's first public hospital and donations to affected schools\\nBefore 1948, Jixi people suffered from the lack of public hospitals, local gentleman Hu Yunzhong went to the field to raise funds, and later found Hu Shi, wrote to head of the relief department branch office Ye Yuanlong, by Ye allocated 50 beds of medical equipment supplies, set up Jixi public hospital (in front of Jixi County People's Hospital body). During the anti-Japanese war, Jixi Trainqin Primary School (now Tantou Village Primary School), was a secondary school site in Jiangsu Province, accidentally burned down. Hu Shi wrote to Zhu Jiahua, the former Ministry of Education. Zhu instructed Ye Yuanlong to allocate a thousand bags of flour for the resumption fund. \\n(4), Funding for the construction of Jingshan Road-Carambola\\nLater in the anti-Japanese war, Hu Shi's wife Jiang Dongxiu returned to Shangzhuang in 1945 because he escaped the entanglement of Shanghai pseudo-mayor Zhou Fuhai, pseudo-mayor of Shanghai. Jiang's family jingde carrying village, about 40 Hua Li from Shangzhuang, rugged mountain road, old disrepair, carried back in person in Wangchuan Baojia village for craftsmen to supervise, by masonry Bao Chunhua led more than 20 people in the middle of the mountain for nearly two years in continuous construction (his son Bao Shun to cook rice water), began to complete. Hu Shu expressed his gratitude (Bao Chunhua was also a Begon man who built a cemetery for the father of Hu Shi), he also sent him at the age of 50. After the victory of the resistance war, the winter show was returned to Beijing from Shanghai and remained concerned about the construction of the mountain road. In April 1946, Hu Shi also wrote to my father: 'The repair of Carambola Ridge, if the money is not enough, I hope to tell us, when we try to add donation at an early date.' \\n(5), Served as a consultant for 'Emblem', often written for the journal\\n'Huiyin' was founded in Shanghai in 1922 by Weining's foreign counterparts. Hu Shi personally named the issue and worked as a consultant with Tao Xingzhi and often contributed to the journal. In September 1925, he was invited by the publishing house 'Huishe' to give a lecture on 'Chinese and Western culture issues'. In July 1926, Hu Shi went to the United Kingdom to attend a meeting of the Geng Advisory Committee. At the suggestion of Li Dazhao, he went to Europe by way of Moscow. Stayed in Moscow for three days, visited the visit, sent back a few newsletters and gave some views about the new Russia. Some reactionary warlords and politicians in China thought that Hu Shi was also 'red'. Among the letters written to Xu Zhimo, that is, published in the 30th and 31st issue of the 'Microtone' in January 1927, the middle wrote that 'political history is just the dream of the Red House that says that it is not that Dongfeng has pressed the westerly wind, or the west-wind has pressed the Dongfeng'. Thanks to the care and support of Hu Shi and Tao Xingzhi, Microtone played an enlightening role in the development of Huizhou's new cultural movement at that time. \\nHu Shi is gracious to those who helped him in his hometown at an early date. He studied abroad, because his family was poor, all relying on Renli classmate Cheng Leting's father to fund 200 yuan, only to make the trip. Le Ting died prematurely, Hu Shi as a propagation, writing poetry. When Cheng father died, Hu Shi gave 400 yuan Dian instrument, which is not without gratitude. On the eve of the departure of Hulumei, accidentally was pickpockets stolen the toll, work for the fellow Latham and tea Zhuang Hu Jiefu learned, is to help 300 yuan. Hu Shixue became home, Hu Jiefu shopping mall failed, was shocked to death, Hu Shi deeply mourned, especially for it as a coupling: 'Jun is a failed hero, now it is. I spill a few drops of thanksgiving tears, what day to forget and funded his Sun Hu Ji Guangren Famous Brand School (now a retired teacher of Haozhai Secondary School). \\nHu Shi is sincere, humble and respectful to the hometown. Hu Shi, whether in his hometown, or in Beijing and Shanghai, people come to see, always approachable, warm hospitality. He has many guests, and sometimes it is not possible to limit the meeting time, but most of his homelands are not subject to this limit. The villagers ask for ink, almost all meet. Employees and apprentices who have worked in Nanjing Hu Kaiwen ink shop and Shanghai Yadong Library are well known about the matter. Ethnic uncle Hu Samu Da Hu Shi 4 years old, he is 17 years old County Xiang, very literary. Hu Shi and him often have correspondence, not only with family affairs, but Hu Shi also conducts social surveys on the demographic changes in his hometown through Jinren. Hu Jinren stained with the vices of sucking opium, Hu Shi wrote to him to advise him not to abandon himself, indulge in words earnestly, sincere feelings on paper. My father, as a young student in Shanghai Yadong Medical University, spent his spare time, loved literature, and participated in the writing of 'microtone' with fellow peers. He served as a military doctor at the anti-Japanese war, serving as an anti-Japanese child, and has been practising medicine in his hometown. Hu Shi has repeatedly communicated with him, talking about poetry and questioning some of his hometown's anecdotes and customs. \\nMost of the hometown people's feelings about Hu Shi are understandable. In 1941, it was Hu Shi 50 Shouchen, when he was an ambassador to the United States and was mobilizing the United States abroad to fight against Japan. Jixi County Governor Zhu Yayun, at the request of the hometown people, personally sent the box amount, on the book 'holding the right way', hanging above the gate of the temple of Shangzhuang, paid tribute to Hu Shi, and renamed the village as 'right village' due to historical reasons, Hu suitable for leaving the mainland in 1949, failed to return to his hometown, 1962 Years of illness died in Taiwan. Taiwan is a part of the motherland, and Taiwan compatriots, like Hashi, have a deep homeland affection. Taiwanese compatriots put Hu Shi's poem 'Hope' ('I come from the mountains, bring orchids and grass...'), into a song of thinking, we hear from the heart of common thinking, the hope that the motherland is about to reunify.
