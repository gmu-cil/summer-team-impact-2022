            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached] Lu Xinglun: 'The Conspiracy of Obaichuan, Vice Governor of Miao, Guizhou Province, was debunked' (Xinhua News Agency, Internal Reference 1957.9.13)\\n[Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, September 7, 1957] The reactionary activities of Guizhou Province's deputy governor Oubaichuan (Miao), secretly planned the establishment of a joint autonomous region of Miao, Buyi and Dong in order to achieve separatist national unity and personal hegemony, have been debunked by many ethnic cadres. At the symposium of minority deputies at the First People's Congress of Guizhou Province held from August 26 to 31, representatives of all ethnic groups unveiled Obaichuan, using their power to pull and incite national cadres to launch a reactionary signature movement for the establishment of the Miao, Buyi, Dong and other autonomous regions. \\nIt was revealed that in May this year, Obaichuan took the opportunity to enlarge and enlarged and invited minority students (5 or 10 people), from Guizhou, Hunan, Sichuan, Yunnan and Guangxi provinces to study at the Guizhou Institute for Nationalities (5 or 10), many times to meet at his home, arranged them back to the college to launch Miao, Qianxiang, Xiang, Sichuan, and Guibian District Signature movement of the United Autonomous Region, Buyei, Dong and others, indicating the scope of their movement The bigger the better. Obaichuan intends to launch a signature movement within the college on the eve of the graduation of 194 Miao and Buyei youth cadres in the language classes of Guizhou Nationalities University, and then through them to expand the campaign to the people of the four provinces of Xiang, Gui, Qian and Dianbian provinces. The EU also pointed out that the proposal should be written sooner, the better, so that during the NPC, he (Europe is the NPC deputer), to the central center to attack several sides. After receiving the instructions from Europe, students of the right, Wu Daolun, Ye Yida (former provincial committee cadres who were struggles in rebellion), returned to the college and quickly returned to the college students Long Congyun (deputy secretary of the Party branch), Long Wenya (Party branch secretary), Zhang Development (Party members), Ma Qikun, Wu Yaqing, Wu Xuexin and others to conspire into a large-scale signature campaign. Nowadays, a Miao teacher, also participated actively in the organization and was the leader of the group, personally drafted the proposal for the establishment of the Great Autonomous Region. On the night of 19 May, a Miao typist Wen Chaopei (a historical counter-revolutionary), printed more than 40 copies. In the early morning of the 20th, the students took the proposal to scam inside the college, saying what college leaders agreed to their plan, thus deceiving more than 400 signatures. However, some students in the signature expressed doubts about the matter. Therefore, they asked the College Party Committee about the root cause of the matter. The Party Committee's reply was not aware of the matter, so the majority of students knew that they had been cheated, and their names had been painted out. Finally, only the names of the few students who initiated the signature were left on the signature book. In this way, Obaichuan directed the signature movement, on that day, suffered a shameful failure. \\nObaichuan attempted to establish a large autonomous region for a long time. In 1955, he and Wu Daolun and Li Ruyun (Director of Civil Affairs Bureau of Guiyang City, Miao), and other Spring Festival pointed to Guiyang City District, and said: After the establishment of the Autonomous Region, a Miao Street was established, and the families of all ethnic cadres moved into the city; build another one 'Shing Tang', for the Miao people to dance and entertainment. Europe is more ambitious to say: How can the CPC Guizhou Provincial Committee not hand over power? In order to realize his personal ambition of dominance, Obaichuan also denigrated the Communist Party's 'prudent and steady progress' policy of implementing its national policy. He fabricated rumours that the CPC Guizhou Provincial Committee had previously given little attention to the establishment of the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture and the Qiannan Buyei and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, until he was at the National People's Congress Presented only after being valued. At the same time, Europe actively solidifies and instigates national cadres in order to provoke them to attack the party. If some people died of starvation in 1955 in Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, Europe has repeatedly incited Wang Dean (Miao), Governor Wang Dean (Miao), to attack the Party on this issue under the guise of protecting national interests. In 1954, at a meeting, Obaichuan also blatantly accused Huishui County Mayor Wei Shiping and Luo Zhenke, and said that they were doing what they were doing below, why did not give 'opinions' to the party committee and openly asked them to attack the party. In addition, for young students, Obaichuan does not give up any opportunity to incite. In June this year, Obaichuan, commissioned by the Provincial People's Committee, went to Guiyang National Normal School to speak, and Europe took this opportunity to care about the life of ethnic students, privately ignited. EU intentionally asked students: How much does your bursary cost per month? A: 10.5 yuan. Q: How many dollars per month for food? A: 8 yuan. And then he asked in a provocative tone: What about two dollars? Some students were thus skeptical of corruption in schools, advising the Department of Education and the Provincial People's Committee, and dissatisfied with the school leadership. In fact, the money has always been the school's mastery to buy footwear and some daily necessities to take care of economically difficult students. Europe went to the student dormitory to see the student bed mat and then instigated, saying what he said when he was studying in the Kuomintang era was a white mat sheet made in the KMT era, so students were even more dissatisfied with the Party. \\nObaichuan also used the power of the deputy governor to gather all the shortcomings in the government's work, exaggerated and distorted, as an example of his attacks against the Communist Party at various meetings. If last year, a regional committee secretary in Qingzhen County, because of the improper working methods, caused dissatisfaction among some of the local Miao people. After the incident happened, the county committee personally resolved, and the district committee secretary made a public review, and the masses were satisfied. Europe caught this case everywhere exaggerated incitement. Also, last year, various secondary technical schools such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and water in Guizhou province attracted a group of students outside the province. Europe also used this to attack education administrations blind to enroll students outside the province, and failed to meet the requirements of students of all ethnic nationalities in the province. Actually, very few students from ethnic nationalities have gone to school. \\nOver the past few years, Obaichuan has attended several major conferences, visits and visits at home and abroad. Instead of being educated in these activities, Europe has used it to slander and defame. If he went abroad to attend the World Peace Conference, he would have defamated the conference just a fight and would not work. After visiting the Soviet Union, he said that the Soviet Union had great powers and was very cold to people. Obaichuan went to Tibet and Xinjiang to participate in the celebration of the establishment of the autonomous region and returned, insulted the two nationalities and said: Syphilis in Tibet all over the streets, even dogs have syphilis; Uyghur women marry and have to sleep two nights with imams first. Xinjiang eat meat by hand, like a savage. With regard to the Miao people, he has also shown great concern, and has always stressed that the ethnic work in Guizhou province should be dominated by the Miao ethnic group. In 1955, the National Language Assignment Conference decided to list the language work of the Chinese, Buyi, Li and other ethnic groups in the first place, and put the Miao language work in the second. After listening to the European Union, Chen Yongkang, director of the Guizhou Language Steering Committee, had a great temper. Oppose the central resolution. \\nEurope is not satisfied with a series of social reforms. In 1954, when he learned to publicize the advantages of cooperation to farmers in the People's Republic of China (Europe is the deputy chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Committee), said publicly that the following does not like cooperation. When Europe visited Meitan County, it was hard to say that cooperation was not done alone. Europe has also slanded the country to carry out the general purchase and sale of food, causing students to eat even rice and eat sweet potatoes. The people of the whole country launched a vigorous struggle against the right-wing elements. Wang Jingyuan, deputy secretary-general of the Democratic Republic of the Guizhou Provincial Committee, actively expose a large number of reactionary evils by right-wing elements and secretary-general of the Democratic Republic of the Guizhou Provincial Committee, Wu Jianping, but Europe terrorizes and softens Wang Jingyuan. \\nObaichuan's anti-socialism against the people is not accidental. Before liberation he was a pseudo-master, and hosted a 'training group' against the Communist people in Guangxi Province, with a lot of evil. After liberation, the Party and the People's Government gave him the rank of deputy governor are still not satisfied. He wants to be the 'Miao Wang' cut the side. In 1951 he made a Huang robe (ancient Miao Wang clothing), dressed in Beijing to meet, causing surprise and opposition from many cadres in Guizhou. \\n(Xinhua News Agency, Internal Reference, September 13, 1957)"}

They are more insidious and spicy to control the lifeblood of China's political, economic, military, and suppress all freedom ideas. Therefore, people who dare to be angry and do not dare to speak, and there are more people who know and ignore them, and they also have anesthesia for them, but the common is the supreme. There are also lonely tiger away from the mountains, the dragon of the beach, useless land. The task I wait for now is, first of all, to make the uneventuous sound amplification, and then systematically teach Chinese nationals with a theories of completeness, and then, on the basis of this spirit, to form an armed force, that within the foreign regularization forces should destroy the Communist regime at all times by thunder and create a Genuine Sun Wen'ism in Chinese society. The current plan is: 1. Strengthen its own theory and create a theoretical basis for realism. 2. Good relations with the head of the Christian Church. 3. deep into the tiger point to gain mutual trust. He also warned Lin Xiangqi that I would like to remind you of particular attention that keeping your mind awake at all times, know that you are in a red blockade and siege. It is very dangerous if you do not have a firm ambition and a clear political move. 4. For the time being, the development of self-knowledge is not considered a priority, which may be well grounded, can be contacted."}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached] Ou yanghui Hui Oral Description/Tang Baolin Finishing: 'Floating in the Turbidity of the World Revolution'-Memoirs of Ou yanghui Hui (May 1, 2016)\\nChapter 9: In Beijing I was classified as the right again\\nOne, say I 'anti-Soviet'\\nWhen it comes to me as the right, we should start from my bets to the Soviet Union. \\nAt that time, all books in Thailand could be sold. It was precisely that books propagating communism could not be sold, even Sun Yat-sen's tri-nationalist books could not be sold. But those who sell books in order to make money, good books and bad books sell all kinds of books from all parties and factions. Those in the Thai government do not understand Chinese, nor do they have that level, so no one manages it. I was watching Stalin in Thailand. 'We don't do Antai,' Stalin said. I adore Stalin very much, think there is such a great man in the world (in fact, there was a book against Stalin at that time)? \\nI had a good impression of the Soviet Union, but later, my impression of Stalin changed. \\nStalin killed a lot, killed Zinovi, drove away Toloski (later also Parker Gb to Mexico hacked him to death), people thought he was a tyrant. In such cases, he wanted to say good words to him, in 1936 (or 1937), he invited the Romanroland, Kidd, and Barbah races (who opposed Hitler, against Mussolini, the leader of the world peace movement), to the Soviet Union in the name of Gorky, invited them to visit the factory, to visit May one farm, cultural people please cultural people. \\nStalin invited these three people, intended to let the three influential figures speak the good words of the Soviet Union. All three people wrote a diary when they arrived in Moscow. Romanroland is said to be the most famous of the 3 people, but Romanroland went until his death and did not publish any text about the visit. When Kidd returned, wrote a book 'I'm back from the Soviet Union,' he wrote:\\n'I saw a lot of people not beckoning to Lenin's tomb, but fists.' \\n'Gorky was well entertained, we lived well, but the cooking maid did not eat as much as our pet dogs.' \\n'Not far from Moscow, there is a meal.' \\n'...'\\nI read Kidd's 'I'm back from the Soviet Union,' and my mind is a little bit moving. We read each other, 'I'm back from the Soviet Union.' The leader said that the book was bad, and the author was the Toloski faction. So we always wanted to see how Roman Roland wrote it. And then I saw a Roman Roland diary \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), one day of which was written: 'I better not publish this book, but after 50 years I die and publish it.' Roman Roland later published a book that was almost the same as Kidd. \\nAt that time, Chen Duxiu's books were sold in Thailand. However, people said Chen Duxiu was a communist traitor, and he went away with Toloski. At that time, I didn't understand what Toloski had to do with the Communist Party. Our faculty said, 'Stalin and Toloski are both of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.' \\nFor example, dealing with the Brotherhood Party, Toloski said that the Brotherhood Party can not engage in armed struggle at this time because its strength is too small, it will give people a network of exhaustion when exposed. It should lurk down and slowly develop its strength and organizational strength. And Stalin believes that the world's revolutionary situation has arrived. Their opinions are becoming increasingly inconsistent, and those who agree with the Trousky opinion, Stalin believe that they are traitors and bought by Trousky. Those who sympathized with Toloski, who shared his views, were killed, and in 1936, a large plot was killed. \\nAfter the murder, Stalin bought the hearts of people, and let Gorky come forward to say that these people are traitors. At that time, a painting on the Paris Times was very big for me, Gorky holding a pen stamped, Toroski, Dinoviev, and so on were like a demon. The title of the painting is 'Enemy without surrender, destroy him!' \\nI think Gorky is right. Gorky is my most admired, and he says so, what else is the problem? \\nIn fact, Gorkicha is anti-Stalin. Gorky often writes to Stalin, saying, 'There is no food, no bread, the child has no milk.' Stalin did not give food to the people of these cultures, saying they starved to death, who said they were messing up day and late. Gorky is also very powerful. He went to the Ministry of Finance and the Food Bureau, and wanted food and milk for cultural people. \\nAfter Lenin's death, Mayakovsky wrote a song of Lenin, and Gorky also wrote a book Memories Lenin, which was well written. Stalin wanted Gorky to write him a book of Stalin's biography as well, and Gorky said nothing. Gorky could not stay in the Soviet Union, three times abroad, to the United States. At that time, we also lied to say: Galle's Tomb went to America to raise money for the Soviet Union Stalin died Gorky, but said to the outside world that Gorky was Toroski dead, that he smoked Gorky with gas. We hated Toroski when we were in Thailand! \\nGorky wrote in a letter to Stalin: 'You are too inhumane, we break.' \\nWhen I was in the Brigade University, the newspaper of the Soviet Army was dedicated to propagating the Soviet Union, saying that the Soviet Union had fallen in a flooding. For example, publicizing the Stalin Constitution. After the Soviet Union overthrew Emperor Russia, the Constitution of Emperor Russia was abolished, and the Soviet Union had another Stalin constitution, which was good in literally: 'All peoples are equal, bring us democracy, bring us happiness.' Also wrote: 'Today in the Soviet Union is our tomorrow'. We also printed a lot of Soviet songs: 'How vast our motherland is, she has countless fields and forests to walk freely, we are the masters of the country'. The feeling given to me is that everything in the Soviet Union is good, very democratic, very rich, and that workers and farmers all live happy days. \\nI did not go to the Soviet Union, and I imagined the Soviet Union as heaven, believing that the Soviet Constitution of Stalin was our ideal. \\nThe Soviet Union designated the day of the adoption of the Constitution as 'Constitutional Day'. On this day, everyone dressed pretty, holiday, drink and dance, saying that this constitution is unique in the world. Only in the Soviet Union, people are like individuals. \\nI thought it was true. On this day of the Soviet Union's annual constitutional festival, we use 'set red', write 'ideal spring', and all good words are used. \\nI had a book called 'Learning Stalin Literature Reference.' In 1950, the country was studying the Soviet Union, but many Chinese young people did not know Stalin, don't know Stalin's hometown, and how he revolutionized when he was young. I'll introduce which novels should be seen as a reference. For example, Stalin is a Georgian, and what about Georgia? I wrote, which book should I refer to and which book was written in Georgia. My book 'Learning Stalin Literature and Art Reference' is republished, and 'Chinese Youth' is also serialized. I also published a book 'Learning References to the History of the Communist Party', which celebrates the Soviet Union. \\nHow did I change my view of the Soviet Union later? \\nIn 1951, I visited the Soviet Union with a delegation from the Sino-Soviet Union Association. Our head was Qianjiagu. At first glance, I saw that the ordinary people were not dressed pretty. The first day we had dinner, bread was sister-in-law, because they hated Chinese comrades. In the hotel, you have to fill in the form, one of which is: settlement method, is cash? Or by which unit? We were invited by the Soviet Union and, of course, the Soviet checkout. People in the hotel know that they can't catch oil and water, so give us bad meals and don't treat us as comrades at all. I think, how do you look like this? The Soviet Union was very poor. They liked money. Americans came to tip, and after eating, they used dollars to settle for the rest. The Soviet people said: 'American good friends, you are poor ghosts.' \\nWe were entertained by the Su-China Friendship Association. They found the bread wrong, and looked for a waiter with the bread, and said, 'How do you take this long hair bread to our guests?' \\nThe waiter said: 'I'm on this! Do you want to?' It has come to the point of service for whoever has the money. \\nI think what we see in the Soviet Union is completely different from what we propagate. \\nWe went to the Soviet Union, gave them Hangzhou silk, gave them good clothes, and the Soviet side sent us a gift: Victory watch. In accordance with the truth, gifts should be rewarded as 'leave a memorial' and so on. This is not the case in the Soviet side. Philayev, head of the US-China Friendship Association entertains us, said, 'Hi, want you to lead the table.' We thought they were all comrades, it doesn't matter how to say it. \\n'Do not go!' \\nI said, 'Did he tell us to get the watch?' \\nQianjiaku said: 'Not like words, even though comrades, there is a national boundary, at least be polite. I go to the collar? Do not!' \\nI thought, right. It felt that the Soviet Union did not respect us friendship. \\nIn the Soviet Union, we visited the collective farm. I saw the image of Jesus hanging at the doorstep of a family. 'How could Soviet communism believe in Jesus?' \\nI asked, 'Who's this?' \\nA Soviet woman holding a child said, 'My family.' She hung a labor hero medallion and is a labor hero. \\nAnd I asked, 'Who believes in Jesus?' \\n'I.' \\nI don't believe: 'Why do labor heroes believe in Jesus?' \\nShe said, 'What's strange about this? I work well, is a labor hero, I believe in heroes.' \\nI asked, 'Are you a member of the Communist Party?' \\nShe said, 'No.' I see not all the Soviet people believe in the Communist Party either. \\nI have a Nanjing representative next to me. I secretly said to him: 'In our China, don't say heroes, it's a model, but also to pull her into the party.' \\nThe Nanjing representative was slippery: 'Alas, don't worry about it. 'People let you see what you see, don't ask more.' \\nThis labor hero has a piano at home. I said very kindly, 'Welcome to join us and play the piano.' Everyone responded and applauded her to one. She said nothing. \\nThe representative of Nanjing pulled me and whispered, 'Don't be a hard man.' \\nI said, 'I'm for friendliness, how good it is to sing.' \\nThe representative of Nanjing said: 'The piano brand has not yet been taken off, it was temporarily moved from the store. Fake! Dude!' \\nI do not understand yet, think: fake? Why do you make a fake? \\nEat, dumplings! I think the Soviet Union was living well, ah, because at that time our country was very difficult. Representatives refer to the brand on the dumplings packaging: the Moscow restaurant. It was sent from Moscow! \\nThe collective farms of the Soviet Union were terrible, all the food laid was confiscated, and the real work was the labor prisoners. Farmers do not get any harvests, so they do not do it either. \\nI saw the real situation, but haven't shaken to the point of doubt that our propaganda was just exaggerated. \\nWhen I went to the Soviet Union, Khrushchev came to power. Khrushchev opposed Stalin's report, which I first saw. \\nOriginally, Stalin engaged in personal worship, killed a lot of people. I just saw this material and I didn't believe it, I went to ask the embassy. When we first arrived in the Soviet Union, the embassy greeted us: 'You should be careful to speak more carefully. The Soviet Union is changing greatly, there are many references that are not the same as China.' I was impressed by the embassy comrades said: 'Now the Soviet Union has not considered Gandhi a pacifist, Gandhi is our friend.' We used to criticize Gandhi very badly, saying that Gandhi served imperialism (he is Catholics and does not advocate the use of force to overthrow the government, but using hunger strike and other methods to make the people oppose the government and advocate a peaceful struggle), people have to hit the left face, he also stretched his right face, but Khrushchev thinks this is good of. \\nComrades of the embassy said: 'Listen to what people say, do not take a stand.' I only knew there were differences between China and the Soviet Union, but I don't understand who is good and who is bad. \\nI looked at Khrushchev's report against Stalin, and at once turned around, arguing that Khrushchev was a revisionist, not a Marxist. \\nMr. Xie Deming, president of the trip, gave me a book and let me translate. I translated the book when I returned to Beijing. This book contains Lenin's will: 'Don't let Stalin be my successors. This man is too grumpy to unite people, I believe him.' I'm still afraid that my Russian language is bad. Is it wrong to understand it? Because in Yan'an, Wang Real-Flavor translated this material, it turns out that Wang Shishimi is a Topai, saying that he falsified Lenin's will and belittled Stalin. \\nI went to the president:\\n'You see I understand that right? Lenin thinks Stalin is unreliable and can't let him be a successor, is it understood that?' \\nXie Deming said, 'Yes, that's what it means.' \\nI said, 'Not right. In Yan'an, we dug out an agent and said that the agent forged Lenin's will, and Lenin's will is false.' \\nXie Deming insisted, 'Yes, it's true.' \\nThe book was published in 1951 in Guangming Publishing House, entitled 'Memories of Lenin Krupskaya'. At the time of publication, probably Beijing did not know that Wang Yan'an was the real taste of that year. As long as the Soviet Union's books were all out, especially the writing of Mrs. Lenin, it was easier to come out. \\nAlthough I have little confidence in Khrushchev's opposition to Stalin, my thoughts on the Soviet Union, when I returned from the Soviet Union, put hope for a good life on the Soviet Union. \\nWe often talked about in The Truth. Who beat Germany? Think not Stalin, is Zhukov. In the days before the Patriotic War, the Germans drove straight into, Stalin thought it was finished, did not go to work for a week, 'I did not expect Lenin's career to the end of our generation!' Stalin lost faith. Still Zhukov, organizing military strength to stand up to Germany's offensive. Germany had hit the city of Moscow, he entered Leningrad, Zhukov did not retreat in Leningrad for three years. He fought in the city, a house and a house was kept on foot, on the third floor of the German army, and the second floor was the Soviet Red Army. Very amazing. When I went to the Soviet Union, I saw the Leningrad wall with the words that Soviet forces insisted on that year, 'We have only six people left today.' 'We have only two people left today.' Of course, then Stalin followed, not a little credit, and some things did quite well. In this case, for example, Stalin's parade at Red Square is also remarkable. \\nI believe that many of the problems are not Stalin alone, but institutional problems, and one says that without democracy, this system produces dictatorship. I am very discouraged by this system, because it was not the ideal I had when I joined the party. \\nSince I went to the Soviet Union, I have shaken the good view of the Soviet Union. Returning from the Soviet Union, I convened the Editorial Committee (I am the head of the editorial office). I said to my comrades: 'The propaganda of the Soviet Union should be measured and more propaganda economically. Politically seems to be somewhat different from our China, propaganda politics is too much, afraid that people will not accept it.' \\nI went to the Soviet Union in 1951 and went for 3 months. He returned to the country in 1952 and said that. This statement became my guilt against the Soviet Union, and it became my guilt for the right. \\nMy view of the Soviet Union led me to be classified as a 'ideological basis' for the right. \\nSecond, and said I 'big democracy'\\nIn 1951, the Sino-Soviet Friendship newspaper sectarian of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was very strong. Some are comrades coming from the White Zone, and they look at the people coming from the liberated areas. At that time, my job title and salary were higher than the comrades from the White District. Deputy Director General Li of the newspaper was 14, and I was 12 and a half in 1947, but I was under the leadership of the deputy director general. Deputy Director General Li must have said that the pay of the University of the Brigade University was high, and did not say hello to me, he pulled me down to level 13. Deputy Director-General Li unites a group of people from Beijing and Shanghai every day. \\nLater, the newspaper came to a deputy general director, Liao Jingtian, an Indonesian overseas Chinese and from Yanan. We talked about it very much in common language. Old Liao is in charge of mission, some manuscripts he is responsible for the final processing, so we have a lot of contact. \\nThis faction in the White Zone always wants to squeeze out this faction from our liberated zone. For example, I'm responsible for everything, but they don't agree to give me the name of the president and make me head of the editorial office. I said, 'If I am not president, there are a lot I will not attend.' The two people who came from the White Zone and the liberated zone have happened a lot of unpleasant things at work. \\nAt that time, we were meeting old, and we only asked the Chinese Propaganda Department to come to listen to the opinions of our two factions and let it solve the problems of our two factions. By reason, this opinion is very mild, and the result is no one, let us meet ourselves to solve. And every time I convene a meeting, everyone refused to come and said: 'We should talk about all, the opinions should be mentioned, just wait for the above to solve it. What else do we have? We can't solve it ourselves.' Others say: 'The Chinese Propaganda Department is also bureaucratic.' Nakachomachi was not happy. \\nWe have to meet every day, not every day. Someone was angry: 'So, if the Chinese Propaganda Department does not come to people, we will entertain reporters, report, and attract the attention of the leaders.' Of course, this is the breath. However, the people sent above put our materials together, saying that we want to call 'big democracy', to strike, and hold a press conference, to cooperate with the right wing in society to attack the party. Later, we saw a material written like this: 'The right wing of the China-Sudan Friendship Association is rampant. Arrows are on the string. If the Central Committee does not deal with it immediately, things will be big.' \\nThe Central Propaganda Department received this material and came to people. After coming to the people of the Central Committee, Liao Jingtian knew that the people came to us, but he, who represented the liberated area, did not speak. Seeing Liao Jingtian does not speak, we are anxious, said:\\n'We always say that China Propaganda does not come to people, now come to people, and you do not speak.' \\nSomeone asked, 'Old Liao, what the hell do you think we have here? Do you think you can work here? You talk to Comrade in Propaganda, solve the problem, or now the business can not start.' \\nOld Liao was angry: 'I always feel someone riding on my head and pulling urine.' \\nThe working group of the Central Propaganda Department said: 'Well, it will not be open, it is clear, let's deal with it.' \\nThe Chinese Xuandian Department first talked to Liao Jingtian and said, 'Old Liao, a large number of your men are the right. Ou yanghui is a dry general, if you don't divide Ou yanghui into the right, the Sino-Soviet Union Association will never be settled!' \\nLao Liao said: 'The Sino-Soviet Union Association is not such a problem. Just let you, how do you love to deal with it, as you will.' \\nAt that time, Lin Lang came to become president (who was formerly the deputy president of Xinhua News Agency), and replaced Old Liao and continued to solve the problem of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Newspaper. Organizations told Lin Lang that old Liao must be classified as the right. \\nAfter talking to us, Lin Lang supported us in the liberated areas. 'They are not the right, and the old Liao is not the right.' Yao Zhen, deputy minister of the Ministry of Public Information of China, said: 'If you do not classify Liao Jingtian as the right, you will be very difficult to work in the China-Sudan Friendship Association.' \\nAccording to the position, Lin Long's position is higher than Yao Zhen. So pressure Lin Lang, Lin Lang is very unconvinced, 'Don't talk!' Lin Lang took up the hat and went away and said: 'Comrade Yao Zhen, you have to draw them into the right. You draw me first!' \\nYao Zhen beat the table: 'What are you amazing? Exactly you jumped out, right!' \\nSo, a total of nine people, Old Liao, I, etc., were classified as the right, accounting for more than half of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Newspaper. In fact, we are asking for a solution to sectarianism. Don't drag it down, just that. \\nI thought I was wrong, and I thought I was a bad guy. \\nThree, 'flowers are laid out, one hundred homes fight'\\nThose who were really engaged in Soviet problems at that time were more liberated. One is Liu Binyan. He is the China Youth Daily who specializes in youth issues, and we often interact with; one is Geyang, he is the president of New Observation. He needs a lot of Soviet materials, and I often introduce relevant materials to him. \\nAfter Stalin's death, the Soviet Union had a period of freedom. I have published in the magazine the Soviet Union's Blood is Not Water, and the Young People's League led the anti-party 'Little Partner of Tractor Station', and 'Not Just for Bread.' 'Not just for bread' is written not just to eat to be thankful, but to be free. \\nAt that time, Mao Zedong was advocating that flowers lay. Mao Zedong said: 'Comrades should be allowed to speak, let comrades speak heaven and not let comrades speak, people will be rebellious if they are not allowed to speak.' \\nLam Lang was able to attend important meetings of the Central Committee, and he would shorthand, one time, he conveyed to us the shorthand of his participation:\\n'Today we have a meeting again. Chairman Mao wants to understand the situation of literary arts and culture, so Chairman Mao has come. This is a regular press conference attended by the directors of various newspapers. \\nLam Lang completed the meeting, and did not even return home, directly to convey the meeting to us. He says:\\n'Chairman Mao advocates that flowers are put together, and one hundred families fought. Chairman Mao said, let's talk about the situation. People do not understand Chairman Mao's intentions, nor do they speak. Chairman Mao said, 'Zhou Yang (Minister of China Propaganda), you talk first.' \\nZhou Yang said: 'In recent times, more love poems have been written, more love novels have been written, and there has been less propaganda politics.' \\nAfter Chairman Mao listened, laughing while smoking: 'What do they write about young people?' \\nZhou Yang said: 'There is a poet in Sichuan Liusha River, who wrote 'Kiss', 'Sichuan Literature and Art' gave him the front page headlines. \\nChairman Mao laughed and asked Zhou Yang: 'What do you see?' \\n'It diluted politics and had a side effect on the youth to readers,' Zhou Yang said. \\nChairman Mao laughed, 'Zhou Yang: Let them kiss it. Let them talk about love. No kiss without talking about love there will be no offspring. You're also literary, you forgot? Isn't the first Chinese poem 'Guan Suijiu, in the River Chaus', is not men and women in love? Don't fuss.' \\nI listened to conveying that Chairman Mao was very enlightened. \\nLam Lang continues to convey:\\nChairman Mao asked Zhou Yang, 'What else is there?' \\n'Liu Binyan wrote a new young man from the Organization Department,' Zhou Yang said. \\nChairman Mao said: 'How about this article? I also read this article. \\n'He believes there are bad people in the organization department and bureaucracy, especially Beijing,' Zhou Yang said. The article is poisonous, pointing to the central organization department, pointing to Beijing. \\nChairman Mao, while smoking, asked: 'Zhou Yang, how are you going to deal with it?' \\n'I'm ready to talk to him and give him the appropriate punishment,' Zhou Yang said. \\nChairman Mao's smoke was not smoked, and asked, 'Zhou Yang, what else do you want to treat him?' \\n'We have not considered it well, as a tendency, to convene a special meeting to discuss this issue,' Zhou Yang said. \\nChairman Mao said very seriously: 'Zhou Yang, let's call two machine guns and sweep him, okay?' \\nZhou Yang does not understand what Chairman Mao's words mean. \\nChairman Mao said: 'Zhou Yang, this is the style of the KMT, not our style. How can I not listen to a little opinion? People write an article saying that people have bureaucracy in the organization department, you can't stand it? There are shortcomings in this article, where are the disadvantages? Just when he did not put the bureaucracy to death.' \\nI heard that Chairman Mao thought was really liberated. \\nChairman Mao said: 'I have read some articles recently. I am very unsatisfied, especially Li Xifan (Li Xifan and Lan Ling jointly wrote an article to criticize the Red House Dream' in 1954, criticizing Yu Pingbo's bourgeoisie mentalism, which was praised by Chairman Mao as the new force of Marxistanism and caused a sensation throughout the country. (Become a national critical movement), I recently read some articles by Li Xifan, Unlike, he turned out to be a little daughter-in-law, oppressed. We liberate him and support him. Now he has become a mother-in-law, and oppresses the family, pointing things and fingers. Tell Li Xifan, don't go too much, should put all flowers together, one hundred families argue, don't teach people with faces, do not think they are amazing. How to deal with Liu Binyan, you can discuss. Zhou Yang, what do you have?' \\nZhou Yangyi heard that the tone was different: 'Would a person like Liu Binyan be a member of the CPPCC?' \\nChairman Mao said, 'Do not need it. You see Li Xifan, whom we promoted, is the representative of the people and a member of the CPPCC. As a result, he left the masses. Do not fight, do not hold too much.' \\n'I heard that Liu Binyan was nervous,' Zhang said. \\nChairman Mao said, 'Young people. I heard that the Central Committee attached importance to this manuscript, of course he was nervous. Zhou Yang, you should consolate him and guide him.' Chairman Mao also said: 'I advocate that flowers are put together, and one hundred families fight, and I start from here.' \\nQian Junrui was also present. He is the Director General, Minister of Education, Minister of Culture, and also the Cultural Council, in several positions. Qian Junrui said: 'Chairman Mao proposed that flowers are in full swing, and one hundred families fight. It is very good, and my hands support. I must carry out, I promise to open only flowers, not poisonous grass.' \\nChairman Mao said: 'Your own words are poisonous grass. You don't let it open, how do you know if it is a flower or a poisonous grass? Poison grass has nothing to do with it. 'Left' is so powerful, how can culture develop? How can literary and arts develop? Good winds, this bureaucracy, the whole dogmatism.' \\nI checked with the minutes of the meeting with Lin Lang's shorthand. I feel that Chairman Mao's speech is very important. \\nLin Lang conveyed the idea of Chairman Mao, and I certainly kept up. I'm very supportive of 'not getting bureaucratic dead', and I don't dare to think. \\nLin Lang also showed me a report by Khrushchev at the 20 congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Stalin was a tyrant in the report, and Stalin had completely violated Lenin's instructions, killed dissenting people, destroying collective leadership, advocating personal worship and advocating dictatorship. The report said that in court, Dinoviev and other guilty pleaded guilty, and the court said that the plea of guilt would be pardoned. As a result, Dinoviev and other guilty pleaded guilty were completed and immediately shot. \\nI also asked Lam Lang, 'Is it reliable?' \\nChairman Mao disagreed with the report, saying, 'This opposition to Stalin is equivalent to a knife.'\\nHaving read this secret report, it will be linked to the issue of China and the issue of our units, believing that the Party is not perfect. In order to protect the Party, we need to mention opinions. Everyone thinks that to be truly responsible for the party, you should put the wind up. \\nChairman Mao favored the whole wind. Based on Chairman Mao's thought, we thought that the flowers should be put together, and that we should do well well and oppose bureaucracy. We sincerely respond to the party's call and oppose bureaucracy. So those of us became 'right-wing.' \\nIt was the end of 1956. \\nAt that time, I looked at Geyang's 'New Observations', and revealed that many layman leaders, bureaucratic, and left out of the masses, even corruption. Zhu Anping believes: there should be supervision. At that time, he was the chief editor of the Guangming Daily. He proposed to sit on piles on a rotating basis, and could not be counted by one. Chairman Mao has let everyone 'put'. No newspaper can let it go. For 'not letting', Chairman Mao criticized Deng Tuo: 'You occupy a pit without shit, you are a dead man to do the newspaper.' \\nDeng Tuo thinks my party newspaper (People's Daily), is giving advice to the Party? He still dare to 'put'. \\nChairman Mao angry: 'Do you put it in the end? You're not letting, I took you away.' Ready to let Shu Tong go as president. \\nWe, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Newspaper and the People's Daily together, sometimes see Deng Tuo sigh:\\n'What the hell? How do I put this newspaper? Put what?' He was distressed, always afraid of the line. Deng Tuo felt very grievous and repeatedly told Chairman Mao: 'I can't do it. I don't know what to do? You find someone, I follow.' \\nChairman Mao said: 'Say you are the show only to do the newspaper, you are not, you are dead people doing newspapers, and there is no voice.' \\nAnd Wen Wei Po made a lot of opinions to the Party. Chairman Mao called President Xu Zhucheng: 'Your newspaper is very good.' \\nOur Sino-Soviet Friendship Newspaper, please refer to Qian Junrui and ask us how to do this newspaper? According to Qian Junrui's understanding, the Soviet Union has an opinion on our practices, and does not agree very much with our practices, saying that I am a 'planned and purposeful opposition party.' \\nTalk about the specific process that I was delineated by the right. \\nWhen the newspaper was a sectarian, I studied at the newspaper leader. People were very annoyed and unwilling to learn, in fact, I didn't want to learn. Every day to learn about the history of social development, monkeys become human, slave society, feudalism, capitali"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "sm, socialism, communism. I think I study these in Yan'an, I also study these at the University of Brigade, study these in Beijing, come back and forth to learn monkeys become human, all learn tired. The result is seen as a disdain of politics, no interest in politics. Anyway, it is infinite. \\nA comrade did not study Russian at all. I said, 'Since it is doing the Sino-Soviet Friendship Newspaper, then, how does it do not look at the Soviet Union materials and do not understand the situation in the Soviet Union? How to report? You must learn Russian, must learn Russian well. Russian is good for work.' As a result, when I draw my right, I said this paragraph into a compilation: Ou yanghui said, 'Russian letters are gold, learn Russian can go all over the world, you can get rich.' (Totally nothing.), \\nI said, 'What do the comrades of the Sino-Soviet Friendship newspaper do not learn Russian literature?' Criticism said: 'To learn Russian for political science, not for money.' \\nI had translated several books at that time, saying, 'You get the bill, and that's it.' \\nHard say I anti-Soviet. Later criticized Khrushchev, and said that I pro-Sue. I was confused, 'Am I pro-Soviet or anti-Soviet? Let me check, what exactly do I check?' \\nThe leader said: 'This is very simple, your individualism is serious, you start everything from your personal interests, this word is useful for you, you will be kiss; this word is not useful to you, you will counter, you just check it!' \\nChina Propaganda finally came to us for a meeting. People from the China Propaganda Department said, 'There is a right-wing group in the Sino-Soviet Friendship newspaper. All actions are planned, premeditated, strategically and organized.' 'The people of this right-wing group are bourgeoisie ideological feelings, they are just one touch.' \\nI am already the right, saying that I have felt that the time is ripe and that the right in society is already anti-party, so I should be outside and is the most dangerous enemy. \\nHe said I was 'an anti-party with a platform, purpose, premeditated, planned,' and 'colluded with the anti-party in society, both inside and outside.' \\nWhy can't I figure out. Who do I plan with? With whom to plan? I was locked up at that time, I thought, where did I have any organization, what plan! \\nI speak to the party committee and hope the organization helps me analyze the analysis. Comrades from the Party Committee must ask me to find social roots. I said I've been following the party revolution. Why do I want an anti-party? You give me analysis. \\nI said, 'I look at myself, I don't seem to be worse than my domestic comrades. For example, the land revolution, the poor have no food, have no way out, is forced to Liangshan; we overseas Chinese have not yet reached this level, I do not want the revolution to do business, but also have a future. Why should I go to Yan'an? I don't feel stronger than you, at least not worse than you. I came to the revolution myself, for the sake of the country.' \\n'The problem is here,' he said. Is it hard to find the root? You are not a worker.' \\n'Yeah.' I agree. \\n'Nor is it a farmer.' \\n'Yeah.' \\nHe said, 'At least a small bourgeois intellectuals, right?' \\n'Yes.' \\nHe analyzes: 'There's always a class sensitive to the bourgeois? Whether you have a heart or no heart, you can think of it immediately. First, now the Communist Party is becoming stronger and more powerful. You know that your bourgeois's future is over, you have no way to go, but you don't want to go with the Communist Party. You know you're not going to go with the Communist Party. It's just a bourgeois consciousness that works in your mind. You got into the party! You are not the same as people joining the party. People's entry into the party is to find a way. You are a debtor, you are the bourgeois, as if we owe your debt, you want us to repay our debt and drill into our party to retaliate. This is the root of your society and the root of your mind.' \\nHe also analyzes: 'Because of these, you will not be used as a tool of taming the party, you want rebellion everywhere, the party says there is right, you don't listen; the party says the right opposition, you don't listen; you should be outside with the bourgeois, is this not a plan? Isn't this an end?' \\nNow it sounds absurd not absurd? \\nWhen discussing my crimes, Lin Lang was very concerned about me, secretly copied a copy of the Ou yanghui Anti-Party Crime Record, and told me; 'You keep it, one day will be useful.' The meaning is probably to have a basis for the rehabilitation. \\nI was asked to sign the Anti-Party Crimes Record, and I wrote: 'Some are not true, some problems I haven't figured out.' Lin Lang gave me a copy of this material, and I understood that one day he would complain and would turn the case back. \\nThis is the first warmth since the anti-right. \\nThe second warmth came from the newspaper, Soviet expert Afchinikov, and he was very good with me. He was upright, when he criticized me, he took a pipe and was not satisfied. In particular, I was said to be anti-Soviet, and he was passionate about throwing pipes. \\nWhen I was in The Truth, my minister, Gharlov, was a press attaché at the Soviet Embassy in China after the Soviet army retreated, and we had regular contacts. I often go to his house, he has a pool, we swim together and play around in his car. \\nI divided into the right, for a long time did not go to him, he called to come. I don't pick up well either. Afchinikov told Gharov: 'They made Ou yanghui the right.' \\nWe, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Newspaper and the Soviet embassy are all on just road, very close. 'Gajalov often waits for me at the door. One day, I went out to buy cookies for my child, met Gharov, and he greeted me. I consider: 'Do not go? Don't go? Not polite; go, a right-wing contact with foreigners, and let people grab the handle.' I pretended not to see, gone. \\nOne day Soviet experts told me: 'Ghaharov wants you to go to his house, preferably 8 o'clock in the evening.' \\nI went. It happened that day, Lin Lang, something went, we touched together. \\nI thought Garhalov was looking for me something, and I asked him what happened to him? And he said, How can you be a right? \\nBecause Lam Lang was present, I'm not embarrassed to say anything. I said, 'Comrade Ghaharov, the better you don't care about things in China, the more you care about us the more trouble.' \\nHe said, 'That is not possible. I must write a letter to Marley to send it to Zhou Enlai. Social what the right I don't care, you absolutely are not.' Gahagaf said Mallex is the secretary and translator of Prime Minister Zhou, whose name is Marlee. When Marley was at the Russian school in Yan'an, we had an exchange. After coming to the Brigade University, he was an interpreter of the Soviet Army and the Municipal Committee. Later he moved to Beijing, and his lover was also classified as the right. \\nI didn't sit much at the Ghaharov house, and I spoke out. I said, 'Comrade Ghaharov, you better not manage my things.' I say this to Lam Lang. \\nSoon after I came out, Lin Lang's car also came out. The car parked a bit, Lin Lang greeted me up. I told Lin Lang, 'You know what Gakharov asked me to come. I shouldn't come.' Lam Lang did not say a word. At that time, Lin Lang had not been classified as the right. \\nSure, from the beginning, what I went to Gharlov's house, Lin Lang has not spoken to anyone. If he was to say this, my sin would be heavier. \\nLater I heard that Garhalov asked Soviet expert Afchinikov, why did Ou yanghui draw the right, Afchinikov said: 'He anti-Soviet, rallied democracy, anti-leadership, improper taming of tools.' Ghaharov was angry: 'Ou yanghui, I know best that we got along very well at the Brigade University, and everything has implemented the Sino-Soviet friendship intentions. How can he become an anti-Soviet element? Become a right? Not possible, I have to find Marlene, must find Zhou Enlai.' \\nI remember that there was a comrade named Zhou Guoliang who handled the letterhead of our newspaper news agency. At the end of the anti-right movement, everyone had a meeting experience. He was honest and said, 'Like those few of their right-wing ideas, I also have, but I didn't say it. I thought so then, and now I knew it was an anti-party.' So, everyone said another leak out of the net right, making Zhou Guoliang the right. He was not allowed to sign, and no material had been put to an end. Later to give him his rebellion, find his materials everywhere. What is his crime? Not found. \\nAsk me: 'Do you remember Zhou Guoliang of your newspaper? What crime is he?' \\nI said, 'You don't have to find his material anymore, no. He was the end of the campaign, saying that he also had those thoughts, 'fortunately educate me', and gave him a leak of the right. To the previous newspaper, there was no finishing his material at all.' \\nChapter 10: Twenty Years of Labour\\nI. 'Uncle becomes an enemy'\\nThe right is the enemy of my contradiction, I am the enemy. My party was also expelled. I dropped level 3, old Liao lowered level 3. \\nLam Lang dropped level 5. \\nI wrote a letter to my family saying that I might have to pull out of Beijing, and I don't know where to go. \\nI thought I wanted to nurture the Chinese feelings of my family, I asked my sister to send my two daughters to study in China, live in my house, and I wanted them to go to school. They were students of overseas Chinese reschool, and they didn't know what the right was. 'My uncle joined the party since a young age in Thailand. Is it the right?' They secretly wrote to my sister, saying, 'China is fighting the right, and fighting the right is to catch the enemy. My uncle turned out to be an enemy, and now has no job, waiting for treatment.' \\nMy sister knew I was divided into the right, very unhappy. Because of my relationship, my sister often had contacts with the party in the past to raise donations to the Thai Communist Party. After I pitched the right, our comrades of the Thai Communist came to the door, and she ignored, saying, You are too ruthless. One of them had a good comrade with me to go to my sister's house, and my sister spoke, 'I don't understand that my brother was red purple in Thailand. He was all rushed. He went to Yan'an. Yan'an was a melting pot of revolution. He should be made into steel. How did he black him?' My comrades cannot answer either, but have to say, 'It may be overstated.' My sister said: 'If the Chinese Party deals with the problem like this, you will not come to us later, we can't stand it.' \\nSoon, the whole family was decentralized. I asked the two nieces, 'I'm going to go to the country, what are you going to do?' \\nTwo nieces said, 'Uncle, we're not studying here anymore, we go back to Thailand.' They wrote to their families, saying they were not accustomed to China's life and wanted to go home. \\nWhen they left, I reported to the leaders: 'Because I went back to the country, there was no provision for life, so let them go home.' \\nTwo nieces asked me, 'Uncle, if my mother asks you how you become the right, become an enemy, how do we answer my mother?' \\nI can't answer. \\nThe two nieces did not return to Thailand and went directly to Hong Kong. Sewing a living in Hong Kong. Now their children are studying in the UK. \\nI'm going to go to the country, and I asked my lover, 'What do you decide? Do you want a divorce? Without divorce, go out, we will go.' \\nThe organization also decided not to let our right down to the countryside, saying that it was too loose to go down to the countryside, saying that farmers were confused. So it was decided to let us devolve to the farm and supervise labor. Mao Zedong wrote an article saying that the right can't kill? The right is our enemy. Why don't we kill? We believe that it is good to not kill than killing, they can at least be a labor force, transformed, mistaken, and re-established. \\nSince I don't go to the countryside, Cheick, head of the intelligence institute of the Academy of Social Sciences, my love unit, said: 'If she has no problems, we are not willing to let her go.' \\nI love to say no divorce procedure, and to draw political boundaries for the sake of children. \\nBefore decentralizing, Qian Junrui, Yao Zhen, Hu Weide and other right-wing talks to us, saying, 'Be sure to know your crimes, why do you become anti-party elements? It's simple, because you don't want to be a party's tame tool, so you fall into the right.' \\nWe don't talk, listen. \\n'You must be taught, must obey the party, must be the party screw. This decentralization is to make you work well, because you are exploitative class consciousness and are representatives of the bourgeois. You must understand the greatness of the working people through labor, look back at what you do, and understand your dangers to the Party. You need to deepen your understanding of the crimes of the opposition, and your request is very simple, that is, to completely transform and re-become human, must be taken orally, and now some people are disobedient and disobedient.' \\nBefore leaving, sign. Chen Qi-xia, Tang De-cheng, Zhong Jianyu (Yanan Lu Yi student, a famous film critic after his founding), all said: 'I don't have an opposition party, I have reservations.' Chen Qi-Xia sign: 'I have never reversed the party.' Because they are not obedient, they oversee the labor. I'm labor makeover. \\n'Supervision of labor' is more powerful than 'labor reform'. 'Supervision of labor' is nothing, only 17 yuan a month of living expenses, and daily labor is done, not to do it. And after receiving work every day, we have to report to the team. Meaning I didn't run away. 'Labour reform' would not have to report to the team after receiving jobs every day. Just work during the day, write checks at night, and finish the next morning. \\nSince I was young to participate in the revolution, so hard, so dangerous, I ran from Thailand to Yan'an, and I fell into such an end. \\nSecond, to supervise each other, implement secret service rule\\nOn March 6, 1957, we gathered at the front door train station. It is simply using a variety of ways to stigmatize us, yelling at us under the general public, and when naming 'Rightists Ou yanghui!' Think of us as prisoners. One by one standing, finished by name, line up in the car in order, to the right to pack a car. Some of the families came to send them, not to speak, and stood aside from far away. \\nI take a look at this situation, not as easy as I think. I did not realize what was called labor reform. I thought that just like in the past, I was back soon, I didn't understand the problem of enemy me as serious, I did not think that I was already an enemy. \\nIn Tangshan, the farm picked us up with a big car, and asked if we would set up cattle, would we catch a carriage? It means no one is waiting for you. We have a total of two labor teams to Tangshan Baigezhuang Farm. Bokezhuang Farm is a large farm near the Bohai Bay, about 50 miles from Tangshan, a saline land. The farm under the military control is a total field, four breakouts. The director of the venue is all platoon cadres, and some have a very low level of culture. There is also a team leader below. The team leader picks from the right, and whichever crime is light, he makes whichever offense is. There is Jiang Hua in the right, about 20 years old, and her crime is one: the husband who joined the army has not come back after the end of the anti-US aid North. On the New Year, she went to the house to dance, very happy. After coming back, she wrote a letter to Peng, saying you should let my lover come back, don't let us be a cowboy weave girl. The result was said to be the back of the volunteer army, and she was given the right. Her crimes were light, and she was the head of the team. \\nOur labor reform team is composed of the right of the various systems of the Chinese Propaganda Department. There are collaborators, with Xinhua News Agency, New Observations, and others. Our team is a total of 29 people. Liao Jingtian (deputy secretary-general), Li Lin (Minister of propaganda), Zhao Luosheng (head of office), and me, from the Sino-Su Friendship Newspaper, are composed of four people in a group. \\nTo the farm, heavenly went dark. The farm prepared a meal, eat a buns, and then slept overnight in the auditorium. \\nThe next day, assign us to three points. It was more than 9 in the morning. The venue is basically planted rice, transplanted rice, hoe grass, but also grow vegetables. The workers in the sub-field are farmers nearby. A captain with the name of Kong is political; there is a captain named Dong, who is responsible for production; and a captain of the king, who is responsible for vegetable gardens and cattle. \\nBy that time, the fall has already been closed. To the second day of the session, assemble workers to meet the assembly. There is a earth table, let us all go to the earth, and everyone speaks about their anti-party crimes so that everyone can monitor. To do so is to put our mighty down, so that we cannot lift our heads in front of everyone. \\nSeveral other disciplines were announced: first, no 'comrades' should be allowed; secondly, not to leave the farm one step, work during the day, write checks at night, and to deepen awareness of anti-party crimes through labor; fourth, not to write letters to the family; and, if necessary, to the captain for inspection; Five, you can only see Chairman Mao's writings, can not read idle books; sixth, each other supervises, who rebelled Transformation, to report in a timely manner, firmly combat. \\nEvery night to write checks, there is nothing to write about, we write to work with the ordinary people. The ordinary people are very hard, they can't make much money a day. They all serve the country and the people, and we also have opinions about the party, and the opposition is wrong. Write every day, write every day, sometimes really can not check out, ask each other, who has what experience, everyone has a copy, write a few lines on the line, monks like repeating 'I'm sorry to the party', and then cross. Anyway, it has come to reform, what else can we do! \\nA month to write a summary, this is blind. We exchange views with each other when we work, what experience do you have, what kind of experience he has, it is. Write short is not OK, otherwise rewrite. \\nIn fact, this is the persecution of intellectuals, but they have listed themselves with a whole bunch of charges, and then stink themselves. \\nThe group meets daily. Through today's labor performance, then to the big group to pass (10 days a large group meeting). How will this group survive? We very much want Chen Qi Chardondo to speak (I slept with Chen Qixia, very good. We have a lot of ducks on the farm. We borrow Soviet money, also with ducks. If the duck broke the skin while pulling, the Soviet Union did not want it, the farm stayed to eat itself. I and Liao Jingtian two are overseas Chinese, will do sauce duck, let's do sauce duck. Let's look at the four nobody, let Chen Qixia come, give him duck and Jane duck liver, and let him go fast. \\nHowever, Chen Qixia sometimes did not speak at large group meetings and sat. The captain of the surname Kong came and said, 'Chen Qixia! You say, what is the harvest today?' \\nChen Qixia said: 'What's the harvest? I'm tired and tired!' \\nCaptain Kong said, 'How much money can you work a day? Mainly through labor to make you makeover! Know how you are anti-party!' \\nChen Qixia said, 'I have no anti-party. Can I be anti-party? I took part in the Red Army during the long march. Can I oppose the party?' \\nThere was a name in the right (often giving us a small report, later as a captain), and then there was a chance: 'You get me up! The party gave us so much effort, you said you didn't have an anti-party? Standing.' \\nWe look at each other. By them so noisy, the time is over, no need to summarize, thank God! \\nCaptain Hole said: 'Disobedient? Come again tomorrow night!' \\nChen Qixia does not care, smoked smoke: 'I don't sit, you fight. I'm not anti-party.' \\nAt the group meeting, Zhong Joan was very hard and said, 'I am a poor child. I went to Yan'an, I was anti-party? I am also dead, and in the future, if anyone writes Zhong Choi and typifies my name, they will write 'Antiparties' Zhong Anxiao.' \\nAnd Tang Decheng is also very hard. \\nThere are three of them, Chen Qixia, Zhong Yuanzheng, Tang Decheng, and the group will not have time. And the captain said, Write it yourself, and then turn it up! Otherwise, one by one pass, the fatal is always not allowed, always pick some problems. \\nI was most concerned about two questions. First, how long did we stay on the farm? Do not dare ask, the above does not say. Second, when can we go home? Is it a week? A month? Or a year? \\nCaptain Hole said: 'Some people go to the farm butt yet to sit hot, just think of going back, no few! Go back not to go back, decided in your own, makeover will go back, resist transformation, never go back for a lifetime!' \\nThird, the deceptor's merit, mu rice 3,200 pounds\\nThe farm wants to increase the production of rice. Originally, it was a good harvest of 200 pounds, but to report 5,000 pounds, this is not enough, the captain came back and called us to a meeting, and said, 'I have reported an acre hit 25,000 pounds. \\nCaptain Dong asked Captain Kong: 'Is there so much?' \\nCaptain Kong said: 'People have paid 30,000 pounds. Can I come back if I do not report?' \\nCaptain Dong asked: 'What do these 25,000 pounds take?' \\n'Look for the right,' said Captain Hole. \\nSo we started to engage in experimental fields. A piece of land as big as the basketball court, I, Chen Qixia, Zhong Jianyu, we three people manage this land, must mu produce more than 30,000 pounds! \\nWe planted this land very dense. Three of us are like embroidery every day, little by little to wait, a grass can not have. If there is a grass, we are destroying. In fact, even if this field can produce 30,000 kilograms, it can not be so fine in Daejeon, how can it be widely promoted? This is not deception? \\nWhen the rice was collected, it was said that this small field collected 3,200 pounds. Nothing at all. \\nThe first year on the farm, I also doubt myself. Why can't I defend the party with an old revolution, but add trouble to the party? Where am I wrong? Always consider the problem according to the above criticism of us. We work well, bite dry teeth. \\nThere is a horse feed called Huang Bei, must be harvested in summer and autumn, and then buried in the ground, ready to feed the horse in winter. We want to prepare this feed for livestock, dig two people high pit, start not tired, dig deeper, standing below the soil up, throw so a day, really tired. But we also bite our teeth desperately dry. \\nAt the year-end summary meeting, Captain Kong cursed: 'You old right resistance to transformation, someone watching you, you move the spade, when you can't see good labor! You think we can't see it. When is your attitude, when is it good? Okay, you guys are not good makeover, stay here! When is the makeover good, when to go home!' \\nThirty nights we waited to eat dumplings. There was no meat at that time, and meat was made according to the farm population. Captain Dong has come: 'You old right, really the old right, it's not fake! Do you know not to eat dumplings tonight?' \\n'Know!' \\n'Who gave you the package? So many of you, still let the master pack? Old master is not the next year? You eat the ready-made, roll me all! Roll to the kitchen to pack dumplings!' We 'roll' to the kitchen went. \\nFor a moment, Captain Hole came to tour: 'Why are you in the kitchen? Pack dumplings? Give me all down! If you put poison, how do we get it? Get out!' We 'roll' out of the kitchen again. \\nNow it's funny. But it was very angry and simply didn't treat us as people. \\nFourth, Xiao Qian lying on the ground labor\\nOn the first day of the farm, two of us played a small report: when in the car, Liao Jingtian sighed: 'Alas, I didn't expect it to come to the farm today.' One of the names (the Literary and Art Newspaper), and one surnamed Zhang (the main office of the State Council), the two of them made a small report, and added oil to vinegar: 'Liao Ching Tianxin disobedience, not pleaded guilty, and thought it should not come.' \\nWhen we left Tangshan, we took a big bus along the coast. There was a name called Fang Shiyu. He said, 'I haven't been to this place and have to be familiar with this environment. The two men who surnamed Zhang said, 'Fang Shiyu is already observing the terrain and is ready to escape.' \\nIn particular, the surname, playing a small report, said: 'Xiao Qian is a full slaverized literary, a black literary. He said his job should be to write things, not on the farm, and he said, 'How good would I use this time to write things. '' \\nLater surnamed Hou became our captain, Zhang's deputy captain. \\nThere is one called Zhao Guilan, who is an accounting for the Bureau of Management. In fact, her crime doesn't matter at all, that is, she returned to her hometown in Shaanxi for the New Year, and her hometown has just established a people's commune, and 30 pounds of gross grain (with skin, peel off, only 70% of the grain left), is equal to only 7 or two food a day, not enough to eat. At that time, Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan called to recall the rural cadres to report on the situation, so the cadres who returned home after the New Year gathered together for a seminar. Zhao Guilan said that the food was not enough to eat. She faithfully reflected the situation of the hungry people in her hometown. The result was said to be opposed to general purchase and sale, against collectivism, and was designated as the right. Her fiancé, an artillery officer, had originally wanted to get married. Zhao Guilan was designated as the right-wing. This suddenly would not work, and it was difficult to get married. I didn't think the fiancé could not be married. Of course, Zhao Guilan's fiance, the artillery officer, did not end well, and was also classified as a right-wing devolved. The artillery officer was expelled from his military status, and he thought: 'The right has no connection, just married to the right.' \\nAfter Zhao Guilan came to the farm, she was hit a lot. She was sincerely and sincerely loving the party, reflecting the situation in her hometown for the party. She said that in her concept, the right is the enemy, that is, the anti-party, she can't accept it, especially when she sang 'Socialism is good, socialism is good, right people run away with their tail', and she is sad (3 years ago I went to her house to talk about this, she still cried, said: 'True Injustice!'). \\nZhao Guilan original braid was long, cut off after he went to the farm. Without a tie rope, she just had a handkerchief and tied her handkerchief to her hair. It happened that this was a red handkerchief, surnamed Zhang and played a small report, saying Zhao Guilan did not obey the transformation, and went down to the farm to dress up the same as in the dance field, with red heads to tie hair. \\nAlways find the stubble, infinite outline. \\nAfter the captain of the last name and Zhang often bully us. One is bullying openly pleaded guilty, one is bully weak. Chen Qixia and Xiao Qian were the most criticized. \\nXiao Qian, this person is very honest, does not speak much, always afraid of offending people. He grew up in Britain, and he followed the British army at the time of World War II, so his life habits were basically oceanized. 'This time to go to the farm to work well, what you say, I will do it,' he said. He used to eat bread and was old. He is the fattest among us and walks harder than we are. Now let him bend one day to night to pick up rice spikes, too tired. We all picked up the head and returned, he picked up slowly. In order to 'work well', he simply lying on the ground to pick up. \\nLast name Zhang said; 'Right collection!' Then, the lesson was: 'Look, Xiao Qian has until now opposed the Communist Party and stigmatized the working people! Where are the working people lying on the ground to pick up rice spikes? He has stigmatized socialism and also seems to have wronged him.' Xiao Qian all cried. \\nThe name said, 'Damn, you still resist! Your thoughts and emotions are so contradictory, how can you plead guilty!' \\nXiao Qian was in his 50s. \\nThe food of that era was not enough, food was often not enough, and the nearby people often went to the farm to steal vegetables. The captain began to say that we destroy, and later took a pergola in the ground, sent people to see the guardia, see the vegetable area, called 'Look at the young children.' Who sent to see the green? Assigned by the surname. A special bullying honest man by his name, let Xiao Qian finish dinner to see the green. Xiao Qian was timid, scared. The night is not wolf howling, and someone steal, daring, Xiao Qian frightened not moving. \\nJiyin, a reporter of the Rural Ministry of People's Daily (he thinks that food cannot be finished in rural areas, is said to be an anti-party right party), is the head of the group, Xiao Qian looking for Tiyin, and said, 'I can't even look at the youth, I can't even see it, how can I see it?' Ji Yin changed Xiao Qian, and went to see the green for Xiao Qian. \\nThe name of his name also reported: 'The right to engage in a deal, the quarter does not know what ceremony was received by Xiao Qian. It should be Xiao Qian to transform, but the season went!' \\nSupervision and prosecution of each other in the revolutionary camps and the people. This is mainly the biggest harm done by the Communist Party to the national quality of the Chinese nation since the beginning of the Yan'an rectification movement. This is the rule law of special agents of this kind of 'mass fighting masses', and makes the people live in the horror of fascism: everyone is an agent. And everyone is a victim. In the Cultural Revolution, this rule reached its peak and continues to this day. \\nFive, artificial meat and artificial fertilizer\\nIn addition to playing small reports, 'fake activists' in the right, like surnamed and Zhang, also 'burning meat'. At that time, no meat was eaten. His surname said that he read a book understood a kind of 'artificial meat', and when fermented with something, it tastes the same as the meat. He said he was going to make artificial meat and contribute to the farm. And the last name Zhang said, rice should grow well, not with water, on fertilizer? High cost. He can make artificial fertilizer, mix soil and grass carbon together, put some fertilizer bacteria, you can make a lot of fertilizer. \\nThese trick they took us to death. \\nDo artificial fertilizer, there is no soil, but also need to f"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "ind charcoal. Dig the grass into a foot or two, and the soil below is called 'charcoal,' mix the soil, charcoal and bacteria, and spread it on the big kang, and then the ondol keeps the temperature, turning those mixtures over every hour. 24 hours a day, on a rotating duty. I and Chen Qixia together 'burned fertilizer', on duty for 27 hours, turn it once every hour, let the following not confess. \\nThere was a lesbian in the labor reform team called Zhao Lanying. Captain Wang asked her to talk about her experience. Instead of sitting opposite, he sat next to him. Zhao Lanying hiding away, captain Wang squeezed over again, and has been beside Zhao Lanying, saying, 'You have not had water in Beijing (planting rice), right? Your feet are swollen?' Homeopathy touch past, Zhao Lanying still dare not shouting. One night, Zhao Lanying on duty turned over 'artificial fertilizer'. Captain Wang said he would come to learn this technology to promote it, and that night he 'came to Zhao Lanying as an assistant.' 'When the assistant', captain Wang manually foot, Zhao Lanying pushed the door and ran. \\nZhao Lanying asked team leader Yang Li, said: 'You don't let me on duty, I am afraid alone.' Yang Li is a literary museum. His lover was originally a journalist for the Youth Newspaper. After he pitched the right, his lover divorced him. So everyone is sick. \\nYang Li reported this to Captain Kong. Yang Li is very concerned about Zhao Lanying, not letting her turn over 'artificial fertilizer' on duty. (Later, two people Zhao Lanying and Yang Li generated feelings). \\nAfter Yang Li reported to Captain Kong, Captain Kong and Captain Dong said: This is the end. Who else says, is destroying the honor of the PLA (captain Wang is a demobilized soldier). 'We deal with it.' Don't even be bullied. Later, the surname of the king was indeed transferred away. \\nWhen we engaged in 'artificial fertilizer', we also had a thief inside. Because of the bacteria fertilizer, the farm is dedicated to each of us a set of overalls. This man stole 5 overalls at once. That day we found that there were no overalls, and later found five overalls worn on him. Tang Decheng brought some books such as 'Three hundred Tang Poems', Xiao Qian also brought some English books, afraid to resist transformation, afraid to see publicly, this person also stole it. This man is inexplicable. It was originally the right to transform it into a thief. \\nWhen the New Year is the most homeless, but we don't let us go home. We asked, 'We have no sentence, according to which article does not let us go home?' \\nSummoned us at 30 nights and said, 'Someone said to go home, like you, to resist transformation and want to go home? No door! When is the makeover good, when will you go home, the makeover is bad, you are on the farm for all your life!' \\nZhang's excuses: 'How many bacteria in artificial fertilizer? I'm going to go to Beijing to test.' 'I also want to go back to Beijing to test artificial meat, come back to good development.' Actually, they're all home. \\nWhen Zhang came back, I asked him, 'What? How about the tests? What is the content of bacteria?' \\nHe said vaguely, 'Confidential.' Do not say. \\nChen Qixia said, 'I know what your name is.' \\nSurname Zhang strange: 'Even a scientist has not given it a name, can you name it?' \\nChen Qixia said, 'The one you tested was called 'no mold. '' \\nI also wonder: 'What is called 'no mildew '?' \\nAfter Zhang's gone, Chen Qixia said: 'There is no mold.' \\nChen Qi-xia went on to say, 'He is blind, 'white work, 'he deceived the party. He also said that we are anti-transformation, only he anti-transformation!' \\nFinally, 'artificial meat' did not become, 'artificial fertilizer', nor did it. But the surname and Zhang took the opportunity to go home once. \\nSix, take the 'divorce' to scare the right\\nAfter the year, began to release water and prepare for spring plowing. That's when I thought that I was not wrong, the more I thought there was no wrong. I think, you are not satisfied with this transformation. Forget, Laozi can't do it! \\nCaptain came, we waved two spades, the past day digging two pits, now can not dig a pit a day. Tang Decheng said: 'Stop! Break! Do it for him.' \\nAt the end of the year, the captain concluded: 'You have done very well this year, very hard, transformation attitude is very good.' \\nStrange! Also put a week off, finally let's go home. \\nOn the way home, I, Chen Qi-xia and Tang Decheng together said: 'We speak of conscience. This year is not as good as last year. Why is it still being praised this year?' \\nChen Qi-xia said, 'Hey, what's strange about this, the party handed us over to them. We're not good for our transformation. How do they pay the account? Party said hello you would be good, the party said you were not good, you wouldn't be good. \\nLet us go home, it's better to escort us home. The officers and soldiers sent from the farm have always followed us to Tangshan, and then collectively bought tickets, and said to the station station station manager and the ticketing officer, 'This is the right faction of the transformation, which has been handed over to you.' \\nAfter coming home, first to the street police station to report, registration, meaning honestly at home, do not contact anyone, do not engage in tandem, if tandem, sin plus one. After I went to the police station, the 'old lady of little feet activists' living in the building became alert to make you free at all. \\nSpeaking of home, Hu Qi, deputy director of the International Department of People's Daily, is indeed a good person. He is a student of Yan'an Academy of Natural Sciences and knows science and technology. He saw that we were tired of transplanting rice every day, and he invented the transplanter. He said, 'If I have no sin, let me do this, I must do it well.' He made rice transplanters with wood experiments. The name also reported: 'In fact, he is not engaged in a rice transplanter, but rather lazy by reason.' Hutch made the rice transplanter really. Do one after another, liberate us, transplanting without bending over. \\nHutch's wife sent a letter to divorce him. One night, Captain Kong called him: 'Hutch, you come for a trip.' \\n'What happened?' \\nCaptain Kong said, 'Your lover divorces you, how are you?' \\nHutchy is simply: 'Leave away!' Take the divorce letter and sign it. \\nWhen he came back, I asked him, 'What's new?' \\n'Divorce your wife,' he said. \\nI asked, 'Is that away?' \\nAnd he said, Leave away. \\nAnd I said, 'What do you do?' \\nHe said: 'Oops, politics can re-enter the party. Why can't families be rebuilt? Leave it away.' \\nThe next night, Captain Hole took this thing to render: 'You don't work well? Who is waiting for you? Hutch (ride), wife divorced, you do not work well, the divorce book will come. I don't want you to leave, but I can't stop it, the decision is in you.' \\nDon't let us communicate with the family, Captain Hole said so too. \\nOur thinking, of course, fluctuates. Xiao Qian secretly asked me: 'What if a divorce?' \\nTang Decheng's lover is an actor, he said that the leader of the past went to his home, and had two hearts for his loved one. 'I'm not home, I'm worried,' he said. \\nLater, farm officers often looked to hudge to help repair the radio. Hutch slowly became familiar with this propaganda, and the propaganda officer sometimes asked Hutch to play poker at the New Year's Festival. Later, the sister of the propaganda officer fell in love with Hutch. People are the sister of the propaganda officer and fall in love with a right-wing affection, and this affection is very valuable. But they were not allowed to marry, and the sister said to Hu, 'Wait for you to go out and I go to you.' \\nThis is a odd woman! \\nThere is also love among the 'old right'. At that time to complete 2,700 tons of steelmaking tasks, Zhong Jung wrote the slogan: 'Fight for 2,700 tons!' He wrote it fast. He was looking for him to write slogans at every venue. Without so many pen, he asked Zhong Jen to buy back to Beijing. After returning to Beijing, Zhong went to Xiao Qian's home and said to Mrs. Xiao Qian, 'Xiao Qian thought home.' Also to Tang De Cheng home, tell Tang Decheng home: 'Tang De into the family is not assured.' \\nSome people love very good, one heard in these news, greeted: 'Go, go on the farm!' Come to the farm. Xiao Qian's lady came, the lady of Lanling came, and Tang Decheng's wife also came. They encouraged their husbands to say, 'Good home, you are at peace of mind, don't think anything else.' This power is great, and the emotions of these people are immediately different. \\nThe farm workers had a good door to me too. At that time, he bought a cigarette ticket. Chen Qixia was a smoker. He slept with smoke and burned his hands before he knew, and then changed another cigarette. As soon as he bought cigarettes, the director of the commissary secretly sold him. If it was known, it would be sympathetic to the right. The workers work with us, let's tell stories, we have to work, and they say, 'Alas, what? You are all intellectuals, saying two more words, what is the anti-party? All right!' \\nSeven, the husband of the soprano Zhang Quan was buried alive because of patriotism\\nRenovated for two years, decided to choose a group of right-wing hats. Who can pick the cap, to study with the unit, determined by the unit. \\nHuang Gang is Lu Yi, good with me. Divided me into the right, he was very unhappy and often gave me a letter. Chairman Mao said: 'So many right-wing parties can get them back a few.' Huang Gang immediately told me: 'The party has to be screened!' The news came quickly, and everyone knew it was to be screened. We wrote the complaint material, said that we were wronged. I wrote, Liao Jingtian wrote, and Li Lin (Propaganda Minister of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Newspaper), also wrote. Chairman Mao once again said: 'The winds of the matter have been great.' \\nThis sentence is not screened again. \\nOriginally, the China-Soviet Union Association wanted to coordinate us to go back to screening. The Secretary-General, who was named Li, was not willing to pick us a hat. With the phrase from Chairman Mao, 'The winds of the case are great,' he rose up and recalled us: 'I have read all the articles you wrote over the case. If you get wrong, immediately pick you a hat; as you are wrong, tell you, I want to aggravate the treatment!' \\nYellow steel again wrote to us: 'Now is not the time, do not touch hard.' \\nIn the third year of the farm, four of the 18 right-wing parties picked up caps, one was Liao Jingtian, one Jiang Hua, one for the season and one was Huqi. \\nIt is not a matter for other people to delay in the farm, and they return to their original units to be redistributed. \\nThese three years on the farm are a kind of persecution of intellectuals. These people are not only allowed to write articles, but also to read books. We have destroyed our self-esteem and self-love as a whole, not to make use of labor, use all kinds of pressure and persecution, to make us fail, and let us not have a place to stand. For three full years, we have lived more sad days than prisoners. Against the right, the democratic atmosphere of the entire society has been destroyed, and everyone's enthusiasm for improving ideas for the sake of protecting the Party and for the nation for the nation has all been eliminated. \\nIn the anti-right movement, there are 550,000 right-wing wing, destroying the entire group of intellectuals, and a large number of people who have lost their homes. I heard that a right-wing couple in the second session also brought their children to re-education. Later, the woman's throwing river committed suicide. In one session, some people in groups wanted to go up the hill to fight guerrilla, shot and killed two of them and captured two. And Zhang Quan (soprano)'s lover returned from the United States and is also a singer, but he won't let him sing after returning home. He said, then what am I doing back? On the right, he suggested that it should be treated equally, 'I am patriotic.' Even this opinion is not allowed to mention, saying that he was sent by the United States to the opposition party. He was assigned to the Northeast for labor, and he was buried alive without a tube in the Northeast. \\nEight, allotted in the days of elm in Jilin\\nWhen reassigned, I have no place to go. My child had gone to the countryside, in the Elm tree in Northeast Jilin, and my loved one was also in the elm, so I went to the elm. \\nThat place is cold, minus 40 degrees. \\nGave me a piece of land. I don't know what to grow and eat enough food. I use 20% of the land to plant sunflowers or soybeans, sunflower seeds collected 20 sacks, and a lot of soybeans. Also raised pigs, I rushed the pig to the ground, and whatever it, the pig grew more than 400 pounds. Also raised a large group of chickens. Anyway, I don't want anything, just be the people. \\nI also go to the meeting right. There is a lot of compulsory labor, such as the warehouse is broken, let the landlord take two people to repair, do not give labor. In fact, those landlords are poor children, grandfather is landowners, and they have nothing to do with them. A woman, her husband, went into a soldier, and a landlord's son to seduce that woman. The production team sent me to follow. I see they do come and go, and a cat in sorghum doesn't come out for a day and a half. The captain of the village was good, and I asked, 'What is the relationship between this man and that woman?' \\n'It's hard to say,' the captain said. The captain told me that originally two people were in love, because the man was the son of the landowner, the party branch branch village cadre did not allow them to fall in love, saying that the child composition was too high to allow the woman to marry a poor farmer's son. The poor farmer's son went away as a soldier. He also said that the landlord's son destroyed the military marriage, and he must be sentenced. Let me sort up the material. I sympathize with the son of the landlord, did not put together anything, and told the captain that they had nothing to do. Even in rural areas, many cases of grievances have been created. \\nWhen I was in Yan'an, I had a Thai overseas Chinese called Zhou Jie-wen, and I was familiar with him. When I was reformed in Elm, Zhou Jiewen was Secretary General of Jilin Provincial Committee and Minister of United War. And Huang Xuesheng was in Liaoning Provincial Committee at this time. Huang Xuesheng was very opposed to the practice at that time, saying that there were so many right-wing parties, the right was not bad guys. \\nOn one occasion, I went back to Beijing to buy medicine for my child and met Huang Xuesheng at the door of Tongrentang. Huang Juisheng asked me where? I said in the elm. She said that the elm did not belong to Liaoning, but to Jilin. She said, 'I can't help you. You better go to Zhou. Zhou Jie-wen in Jilin Provincial Committee, what difficulty you find him.' \\nOnce I came to Beijing to fight a lawsuit, there was no place to live. I thought that the manager of the Overseas Chinese Mansion was Thai, I went to him. Who thinks he triggers me, let me live pay dollars in the VIP building. The next day, he saw me not go, and let the waiter say to me: 'We are not open to the right, it's better you find another hotel.' After this time, I feel that my fellow people can't rely on, so no one is looking for, Zhou Jiefen, I do not find either. \\nCan't think, Huang Xuesheng told Zhou Jiefen: 'Ou yanghui in Elm, you should help him.' Zhou Jiefen is the head of the United Front War of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. He brought a large number of democrats to visit the elm (Elm is the best in Jilin, rich in soybeans, can eat meat, eat fine grain, relatively wealthy). In order to let these democrats say good words, let the elm eat well for these democrats. \\nThe commune party committee asked me and said, 'You come on a trip, and a comrade from the provincial committee came to you. I have a look: 'Hey, Zhou Jiefen has come.' \\nZhou Jiefen very polite: 'Old people, don't do this.' Shake hands with me in front of other provincial committee members, 'This is my old superiors. In Thailand, he revolutionized earlier than me and did a lot of revolutionary work.' Zhou Jiemun asked me to eat and find the people of the municipal committee for accompany \\nTemporary farewell, Zhou Jiefen said: 'You have any difficulty to find me.' \\nThe secretary of the CPC Municipal Committee heard. After Zhou Jiefen left, the secretary of the Municipal Committee said: 'Old Europe, you do something in the county, people can speak for you.' \\nI said, 'What? I can't do anything.' \\nThe most valuable thing in rural areas was electricity, transformers were planned distribution, and they were expensive. The municipal committee secretary said: 'You give two transformers.' \\nWhere do I get it? I said, 'I can't get it.' \\nHe said, 'All right, I write an introduction letter to you. If you are the right, I say to send you to power us!' \\n'I can't do it!' \\nThe secretary said, 'You go to Zhou Jie Wen. He is from the provincial committee, he has.' \\nIf I could not go, I couldn't refuse again, but I had to promise. \\nI went to Changchun and found Zhou Jiefen and said: 'You got me trouble, not I asked you to find trouble, it was people who asked me to find you two transformers.' \\nZhou Jiefen very fast: 'You can! This is not to look at the face of the fellow, elm in production is not small, should support, give you two. No problem.' \\nHe made me stay at Changchun Hotel. I do not live and say, 'So expensive!' \\nZhou Jiefen said: 'All right, you don't need to reimburse, I will pay you.' \\nI brought two transformers back to Yulin. Everyone looked at me in another eye, saying, 'You give the county welfare.' The electric light is on and the rice mill machine has moved. \\nBecause I 'made welfare' in the county, I was not allowed to work in the production team and let me go to the warehouse custodian. Yushu County put department stores, hardware, production materials together, so the warehouse is large. Great warehouse winter is very cold, still do not let fire, fear of fire. Then said, 'The warehouse is too cold, you go to the cafeteria.' But I feel bad about the numbers. When I see the digital head hurts, a single account is five or six times, not the same every time. So I look for someone every month, first ask him, and then help me account. \\nIt was 1962. \\nNine, I picked myself the right hat\\nBy the end of 1962, the Communal Party Committee informed me that we could pick up five right-wing hats and have you. \\nThe party committee asked me: 'How to pick?' \\nI said, 'I don't know how to pick.' \\n'You ask.' \\nWhen I was on the farm, I knew to make a summary to the right, say what progress or something, and then to report to the municipal committee and the provincial committee, I could pick up the cap. \\nI said so, the people of the Party Committee said, 'How good are you, how bad, I don't know, look and write it yourself.' \\nI said, 'That's okay? I can say how well I can?' \\n'Good, afraid of what?' \\nI said, 'I can't write it, or your secretary.' \\nPeople from the party committee said, 'The secretary can't write this, you write it yourself. Isn't that going on? Don't turn around.' \\nI had to write my own materials. Written, submitted to the Provincial Committee for approval. \\nThe people of the commune told me: 'You picked your hat. Today, opening the right-wing assembly, announcing that the right is picking up, you are ready to speak, just according to the material you wrote yourself.' \\nI looked at the material I wrote, and the Provincial Committee added a sentence: 'Thanks to the Party for getting me back into the ranks of the people.' \\nI originally did not want to write a similar sentence, hit me 50 boards, but also thank the Lord Longen. This sentence added to me by the secretary of the provincial committee, which I did not read at the Assembly. \\nIn 1963, I took the right hat. My right-wing hat was picked up by myself. In fact, there is no difference between picking a hat and not picking the hat, or the right party. \\nTake the right hat and let me burn. Northeast with a firewall ondol. This work is even worse, because the burning is not easy to blow up. As soon as it blows, people say that the right is doing destruction. At most, I burned 6 rooms with firewalls and Ondol. It's really heavy physical labor to burn 56 tons of coal in almost a month. \\nWhat I feel most distressed is that I can't do my writing work, even reading this literary book and people say, 'Don't look at those, you should look at the master selection.' \\nChapter 11: After the right hats\\nFirst, the big daughter is very strong, dead very wrong\\nNot a few years after picking the right hat, the 'Cultural Revolution' began. \\nAt the beginning without us, we are all fighting the capitalists and the bourgeois reactionary academic authority. And we are all 'dead tiger.' I'm in which fighting team people don't want me, saying I'm the right. I organized a fighting team myself, and I was alone, named 'Ordinary One Soldier Fighting Team.' I am looking for red paper quotes myself. But at that time, all the production of the revolution was discontinued and no red paper produced. I was looking for red paper everywhere. Has been running to Tonghua, Tonghua is located in remote, still producing. I just bought red paper in Tonghua. I came back with the words of Chairman Inmao and made a red cover. \\nIt should be said that I did not suffer much sin in the Cultural Revolution in the elm, because people think of me as a 'dead tiger', the old right. But because I worked in the Su Jun's 'The Truth' newspaper, people suspect that I am a Su Xiu agent. No matter who fights, I have 'accompany', I have all struggled and bent over, and I am used to it, it doesn't matter. \\nBecause I had a lot of good things to farm offices in the poor, in addition to having electricity, let me go to 'see the green', the ordinary people steal things, and I let them take them (they didn't have to eat), so they were good for me. Sometimes the table: 'You old right, old stubborn...' The voice shouted very high, but not hands-on. \\nOn one occasion, the villains said, 'Kill people everywhere, why are we not killing many elms? We have soft hands, we must kill it!' The ordinary people rushed to give me a briefing letter and said, 'Tonight is going to run a congress, fight you, kill you, and hurry away! To the east, we stand on the east.' \\nWe have two daughters, one son. The boss is a daughter, the second is a son, and old three is a daughter. In 1960, the eldest daughter was sick. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, the older daughter was the first grade of junior high school and the youngest daughter went to the first grade of primary school. My loved one's mother and sister live together, all in Beijing, so 3 children were placed in my grandmother's home. I'm in Jilin elm, my lover in Shandong four clear. \\nSlowly, the eyes of the eldest daughter are getting blurred, my loved one's sister is in a hurry, do not know what reason, how to pay with us! \\nHer sister wrote to my loved one, saying that the child was not working, it was difficult to walk. \\nHer sister also told me about the condition of her daughter and my loved one's respective units, but the unit didn't tell us. \\nThe big daughter is very good, strong and stiff. She couldn't find a way to go to school... and then her eyes were blind. My loved one returned to Beijing, brought three children to the elm, and my lover returned to the elm. \\nWhen the Cultural Revolution began, I was locked up and prevented from going home. I love someone in the county education bureau, nor can I go home. There are only 3 children in the family, 2 children are still very small, attend primary school, one third grade, one in the first grade. My older daughter is sick no longer able to study, but what about the life of younger brother and sister? The older daughter is hard to take care of, struggled, the meals are sweet or salty. \\nSome of our units are very good, really can't see the past, just go see my children. Liu Wen came to see the child: 'How about the New Year? Cold not cold? Burn no ondol?' The result of the street people looking for him to talk:\\n'What is your relationship with Old Europe?' \\nLiu Wen said, 'The old Europe is the right, and the children are always guilty, right? I care about my child, can I?' \\nThe eldest daughter is no longer. The sister of the lover wrote: 'The child is no longer possible, come quickly.' \\nMy loved one and I decided to send my daughter back to Beijing for medical treatment. My loved one sent my daughter back to Beijing, and was returned to the elm. I had to give the child to the sister of his loved one. \\nAt that time, the 'Cultural Revolution' had just begun, and there was a lot of chaos in the hospital, let alone to see the right-wing children. My beloved sister was a principal, and he spoke good words to the hospital. \\nThe daughter is diagnosed with a brain tumor and is ready for surgery. The procedure must be signed by the parent. The above does not let us return to Beijing. I was in a hurry, I ran back from the farm back to Beijing. I didn't dare to take a car directly on the road, around Qiqihar. \\nAt that time, some old ladies in the family home were active and supervised people all day long. Everyone knows I am the right, 'Ou yanghui appeared!' It was reported to the police station that night. My daughter just finished surgery. At more than 6 o'clock in the morning, I just returned from the hospital to my child's grandmother's home (Lishi Hu Xiang). Police at the police station had already waited for me at the door. All the tickets for the repatriation were bought. Immediately escorted me to the train station and sent me back to the farm. My daughter had just had surgery, had been lying in the hospital, and no one was in the hospital, and I never saw my daughter again! I feel sorry, kid. \\nMy older daughter is very knowledgeable. She came to life a good day not, especially in the Northeast, she was blind, after two cold winters, her head became more and more hurting, sometimes suddenly shock... daughter died. She is only 26 years old. \\nTwo, respectable my sister\\nIt was probably 1979, my sister came to see me from Thailand, and while waiting for me in Hong Kong, I was still in the Elm countryside. Hu Yaobang has given us a trespass, but has not returned to Beijing yet. I was authorized to go to Hong Kong to see my sister. \\nWhen I met my sister, her first sentence was, 'Does anyone follow you?' \\nI said, 'It's hard to say, just follow. That's what happened anyway.' \\n'How do you become the right?' \\nI said that I was mainly opposed to bureaucracy and hoped that the organs would do well. As a result, I said that my anti-leadership is an anti-party. I asked my sister Thai comrade, okay? I haven't contacted Thailand for a long time. \\nThe sister said, 'Do not mention it, they're not doing it.' \\nI said, 'Oh, I really want to go back and see them.' \\nShe said: 'We all welcome you back, you must not go back to these people, these people have a lot of opinions about you (the Communist Party of Thailand).' \\nThese people should have a big opinion on me! But who can think of decades of revolution like this? Am I not the same too! I thought that when Mao Zedong met with overseas Chinese inscription in Yan'an Cave in 1938, the hopes and demands of our overseas Chinese were as keen as such. That is why we go all out, desperate, even to support Yan'an, and then to support the liberation war. However, after the capture of power across the country, immediately turned off people's face, first with 'overseas relations' (sending special suspicions), to break the overseas Chinese into the land, rich, and vice versa; and then to reverse the right, the Cultural Revolution, and simply find a miserable crime, causing us to die. \\nThe second time I saw my sister was waiting to see me in Guangzhou. I was still in Jilin Elm. I went to Guangzhou to meet my sister. She saw that my life was very difficult. (buy all tickets at that time), I was going to buy a radio for my eldest daughter. I said the older daughter had died. She bought my son a bicycle (I couldn't buy many industrial coupons at that time), bought a violin for the old three, bought me a watch, and said, 'How do you socialism do this?' \\nI asked her about a few people. One was Zhang Qingchuan, who had led my fight in the past, and my sister told me: 'It's been a long time ago, he was fortunately not in China, and he was the right in China.' \\nI asked Zhang Qingchuan why didn't you do it? 'I heard that he disagreed with the party,' she said. He thinks that the Chinese Communist Party can't move to Thailand. The first Thais do not welcome them, do not want to talk about communism. As soon as they talk to them about the Communist Party, you will be anxious! The second Thai Communist Party went up to the hill to fight guerrilla, sacrificing a lot of people, but nothing was done, and later all surrendered. Now people have made the so-called base of the Thai Communist Party into a tourist area. My sister was enthusiastically supporting our revolution, and now it's sad. \\nMy brother-in-law too. He is the head of the Thai electricity industry for the film and has been organizing donations to help the Communist Party of Thailand. When he heard that I was classified as the right, he felt very painful. After that, they would not be with the party. Our comrade from the Thai Communist Party went to my house, and he asked our comrades: My brother was the redest in Thailand, red and purple, he went on any difficulties, and he did whatever sports he did. Yan'an is originally the melting furnace of revolution. He should be made into steel in Yan'an. How is it black? Become the right? You guys explain to me.' As soon as a comrade comes to him, he said, Have you come to me for donation again? I don't donate a penny to you either.' Later, Thailand came to my sister's house, and my sister won't receive it, saying you don't lie to others anymore, we are not fooled. \\nMore than half a year from her last visit, she came to Guangzhou this time mainly to bring me things, mainly material support. It's too difficult to see my life. She brought some fabrics, clothes. I really didn't think that the 'new China' was established and that overseas overseas Chinese would support us. My sister also said: 'When you jumped into the pot of overseas Chinese, smashed iron, I brought these things back to the Northeast, will you give points again?' \\nGood big irony! I feel bad in my heart, I have to do the revolution for so many"},

My sister greeted me in advance before going back: You better not find your old comrades, they hate death. \\nHo Shu can pick me up at the airport. He was a worker, and I introduced him to the Fifth Chapter of the Anti-Japanese Salvation Council. It was also originally in mainland China, but seeing the Communist Party hit landlords in their hometown, a little bit of trouble, and did not agree to do so, and ran to Thailand. After arriving in Thailand, he made an agreement with us: to stay away with the 'buddies', only to participate in the National Salvation Council, not to participate in the Communist Party. I told him patiently about what the Communist Party is doing, seeking happiness for workers and farmers, and so on, for a year or two. When I arrived in Yan'an, he was not a Communist Party, but he had already participated in the National Salvation Congress and raised donations for the Eighth Route Army, and he was invisibly on our ship. Then he said to me, You pulled me on the boat. \\nOld Ho is characterized either not to participate, or he really does. The Eighth Route Army gave us skilled workers who want to manufacture and repair guns, especially telegrams, to car drivers (and also have to repair cars). There are many skilled workers among the overseas Chinese in Thailand. Only telegrams are difficult to find. Ant Light has proposed to run a training course for telegrams in Hong Kong. He heard about this, saying that I couldn't do this movie theater. I came to give you a teacher and organize this training class. After he arrived in Hong Kong, he gave us several groups of telegrams, a group of 20 people. The Japanese occupied Hong Kong, why would the old not withdraw and move the training courses to Macau to continue. Their telegram training courses have links to Yan'an, the New Fourth Army, and the Eighth Route Army, and contributed very much to the revolution. Ant Light is delighted, saying, 'This is not what money can be calculated.' \\nLater, Thailand went up to the hill to fight guerrilla, what was the old \\nThere is a capitalist who is a soy sauce member, but is patriotic and very decent. The Thai Communist Party used him and said, 'The Thai Communist Party has no money, nor does the CPC have money, and the Soviet Communist Party At that time, the Soviet Union said, 'You open a shop, and I send you the goods, and the money sold is yours.' The Thai Communist Party used this capitalist, in addition to selling soy sauce, opened another department store, selling Soviet goods: cars, motorcycles, televisions, cameras, and sold very cheaply. The money sold went through Old Ho and sent to the Thai Communist Party to fight guerrilla. \\nOld Ho received me at the airport and said: 'Live in my house, live in my house better than living in your sister's house!' \\nI returned to Thailand, the first stop was Hong Kong, where I switched to the plane. I met Chiu Yasan, secretary general of Chaozhou Hall of Thailand. Qiu Yashan originally opened a bookstore in Shantou, because he was found a leaflet, the bookstore was closed, he had no way to go to Thailand, and after he went to Thailand, he saw us still sprinkle leaflets, engaged in flying rally this set, and said, 'This is not the way out.' He supported the Eighth Route Army, but did not live a party life. \\nBecause Mt. Qiuba appeared, the Thai government thought that he was a Communist Party, and later after investigation found that he was not a Communist Party, he did not catch him empty, but only drove him out of Thailand. Mt. Mt. Qiu Ye has a very good position in Hong Kong. He is very patriotic, makes friends and often writes Liu Shushi, of the Thai Communist Party, is sick. He is responsible for all the costs of accommodation, medicine and other expenses during his visit to Hong Kong. The Japanese came and the party decided to leave him and stay in Hong Kong to take care of our comrades because he was not a party member. \\nMt. Qiu Tu is such a person. I went to visit my family and he invited me to eat. We haven't met for more than 50 years from 1938 to the 80s, very friendly. He said, 'I heard that you were classified as the right, and that you have been working for 20 years. It shouldn't be!' \\nMy brother-in-law asked, 'Brother, you're going to revolutionary life, you tell me, what is socialism? What is socialism with Chinese characteristics?' I said, 'I still don't know. I can't say it. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said he wanted to touch the stone across the river.' \\nSome overseas Chinese also asked me, 'Is there any Communist Party in the end? Is there a communism? When will it be achieved?' \\nI said to them, 'Deng Xiaoping said, 100 years, 200 years.' \\nThey said, 'Then use you to say?' \\nI said, 'The road is step by step.' \\nThird, to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and became 'black'\\nI went from the farm to the elm, before and after a total of 20 years. How many 20 years a person has? I was 30 years old when I arrived at the farm in 1957, and I was 50 years old when I returned to Beijing in 1978. \\nIn 1978, my labor was over. At this time, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Newspaper has been withdrawn, and I have no units to receive it. I went to the Central Group Department, the comrades of the Central Group Department and said, 'You have all returned to the original unit. You were originally from the Sino-Soviet Union Association, and the Sino-Soviet Union Association did not have. What should I do?' \\nJilin University has a male wood (writing the Eighth Route Army March). We are classmates in Lu Yi. I met him in Changchun and told him that I had no place to go. He said, 'Do it well, let's teach Chinese at our Jilin University.' \\nBut I still want to go back to Beijing. The opinion of the middle group is: as long as someone receives you, we have no comments. But I don't know who can receive me, I decided to go to Jilin to find a teaching of male wood. One day, I went to Xinhua Bookstore to buy a book, just hit Huanggang. \\nHuang Gang asked me, 'Where is now?' \\nI said, 'There's no place to go.' \\nHe said, 'That's good. It happens that the Ministry of Civil Affairs is going to set up a revolutionary history research room dedicated to writing martyrs, come on.' \\nI'm happy. \\nHome Affairs Minister Cheng Zihua, who was our commander at the time of Ji Char, I was very familiar with him. He listened to the coming of Old Europe and said, 'That's great!' Exactly at that time, the Ministry of Civil Affairs was the Ministry of Civil Affairs, without going through the Central Group Department, Cheng Zihua said to the secretary, 'Hurry up the old Europe.' \\nThat's it, I went to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. \\nThe personnel of the Ministry of Civil Affairs basically came from the Northwest Bureau, Liu Jingfan, Kingdom Quan and so on. They do not seem to like us people from the south, as if we took up their positions, especially exclusivity. They oppose the practice of martyrs, saying that it is not a matter of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, it should be a matter of the Propaganda Department, it is a matter of the Party History Research Society, so they think this revolutionary history laboratory should be abolished. In addition, the group of people in the northwest likes to lift their cars and touts. For example, our director of the Political Affairs Department took the car downstairs to the office, many people would not work, rushed out to drive him the door, and then pour tea. I'm not used to see these, exactly I won't have this set, so I feel unfit. \\nThis is the way to get rich in promotion in that era. Unfortunately, because I did not know this way, I reformed for 20 years, but still did not learn this one. \\nThe Director of the Department of Political Affairs approached me, and I often sang the opposite with him. For example, questions about the 'Gang of Four' are communicated internally first. When discussing how to deal with the 'four gang', the director of the Political Department said: 'The party decided not to kill. It has been decided for life, you must do the mass work and support this decision.' At that time I was not convinced, should not kill, should I look at the crime, how do you say kill, say not to kill, do not kill, this is not the rule of law. I didn't say anything at the meeting. After the meeting, everyone went away. I pulled the director, and I said, 'Why don't we do it according to the law? Who decided that?' \\n'The Party Central Committee decided,' said the director. \\nI said, 'Kill, not kill or kill, according to the law, who should not decide. If the Gang of Four does not kill, China will have no one to kill!' \\nThe director stare at me and said, 'Do you say that to the masses?' \\nI said, 'This is my heart, according to what you say, let's go, I don't speak. Whoever asks me, I say I should kill, shouldn't kill, not kill.' \\nThe director was unhappy: 'How do you make sense?' \\nI said, 'This is my character.' \\nHe never assigned me a post. When our director traveled on a business trip, he said, What do you have to ask Ou yanghui. I went to him and asked, 'What am I? I don't even have a job, ask me why?' \\nHe said, 'What can I solve?' \\nI said, 'Give me a job.' \\n'We think about it,' he said. \\nLater, the director of the Department of Political Affairs said to our director, 'How do you give him the position? You let him speak to pay attention!' \\nThe director told me, 'The director of the Political Department said, let you speak to pay attention.' \\nI said, 'You tell him that old Europe's participation in the revolution is a gunner, not a saloon, nor a drummer. I do not lift the sedan, nor do I give you a preach! You are assured that it doesn't matter to give me a position.' So until I leave, I don't have a job. \\nI lost tears when I left. I didn't expect me to have been in the revolution for decades, I'm a black man, no accounts, no jobs. \\nIn 1982, I left. I was the first group of retired cadres. \\nI was crying away. Liao Jingtian also said, 'It's too unfair!' However, compared to other overseas Chinese (party members), encounters, there is no post, not giving a house, a small thing. \\nChapter 12: Continued exclusion after separation\\nFirst, the publication of 'biography', after success was pedaled\\nThis is the first thing I did after my leave, and I was not willing to do anything in the second half of my life for decades. The Ministry of Civil Affairs Revolutionary History Laboratory contains a lot of martyr materials. I propose that so many martyrs can produce biographical literature, ready-made stuff. It happened that Li Xin was the director of the Institute of Culture and was Lu Yi in the past. I went to him and said, 'Old Li, let's make a Biography Literature,' hang up at your Institute of Literature. Here in you out the most suitable, you come to be the president, we make up together.' \\nLi Xin said, 'So let's go. I can be editor-in-chief. But there are three points: first, can not lose money, two trials, lose money will not come out; second, I do not see the manuscript; third, the first, second period of self-pay.' \\nI promised it. I have a lot of confidence in this Biographical Literature. So, Biographical Literature was created. \\nWith me, there are Liao Jingtian and Wang Weito. There are also two girls, including Li Xianhong, who do such work as writing and registration. \\nThe first was very good, the girl told us: 'Two more days will be the New Year.' When the New Year's New Year, suddenly, the girl said to us: 'The president said, after the year, a few of you dead old men will not come.' \\nI thought it was a joke. I went to ask Lai Xin. Li Xin replied: 'Alas, the ministry does not agree, saying this publication is not done.' \\nBut after a few of our 'dead old men' have gone, this publication is not only out of the year, but also now out. After we started a business, it is actually 'pedaling' out. \\nSecond, the preparation of the film about the intoxication, was dumped before shooting\\nThis is the second thing I did after my leave. When I assembled the first edition of 'biographical literature', I went to get intoxicated, let the intoxicated write a biography. Intoxication wrote an article 'Intoxicated Autobiography'. \\nAt night, I slept in a room with indulgence, and he told me about his own story. \\nThe earliest loved one to indulge was Moye, the author of Yanan Song. Both of them have been in love for a long time. Moyer said to the intoxication, I will go up to Yan'an, and I will koloo art. Enchanted also wanted to go to Yan'an. He constantly read progressive books and sympathized with the 'One Two Nine' student movement. But one of his elders was a KMT member and said to indulge, 'You go with me, you have a way out.' After Moyer arrived in Yan'an, I sent a letter to the intoxication, saying that Yan'an is very good, is a promising place for the revolution, 'Come on too.' However, his family was not allowed to indulge in Yan'an, and he was enrolled in the KMT military academy. So, the intoxication and Moyer were separated. \\nIntoxicated and said to me, 'I regret not walking with Moyer. Later, the intoxication has been not to mention Moye, afraid of their historical influence Moye. \\nEnchanted second lover's home is rich. At that time, intoxicated in the KMT officers were very strong and powerful, and they were able to protect her family from extortion and bullying. \\nAfter being caught by us, the Kuomintang thought he was shot by us and opened a memorial service for him. Indulge with a best friend and start taking care of the intoxicated lover. This friend originally did not mean to the intoxicated lover, but the father of the intoxicated lover was ill, called both of them to bed, said: 'Indulge is your best friend, intoxicated died, she has no one to take care of, if you have a little friendship to indulge, always take care of her.' \\nThe friend said, 'Please rest assured the elderly, I will take care of her.' \\nLater, the two of them were married, and after they got married, they had children and arrived in Hong Kong. \\nThe first requirement is to find a loved one in Hong Kong. Intoxicated without knowing that she was married. Our cadres implicitly advised intoxication: 'You better not go, you go useless, the situation is constantly changing, now do not know how.' \\nHer beloved letter told that I was married. Intoxicated and said, 'You are married and I go, and I want to see you.' \\nAfter being intoxicated in Hong Kong, his friend knew that he was intoxicated with a very strong temper, but also knew that the intoxication with his loved one was very loving, favorite this wife, the degree of love more than Moyer. So this friend is scared. But we can't lose sight of it, but have to resolve: no matter what behavior is in the moment of indulgence, we can't do it right after all. \\nIntoxicated in the place where they lived, it happened that both of them were. The friend grabbed the intoxicated hand in front and said, 'I'm sorry for you, we are already home.' \\nUnexpectedly, indulge in a sudden kneeling and said, 'Where: you are my real friend, you let her not suffer much when she falls, I thank you very much!' Finish, give him that friend kowhead. \\nHis friends were moved without knowing what good to say. \\nSo what exactly does this thing do? His friends let his lover decide: if you go with indulgence, you can, or keep on with me. And the loved one made intoxication decision, and intoxicated and said, I am full of you, you are too rare. After two days, intoxicated from Hong Kong back to the mainland. \\nAfter being a member of the CPPCC, he went to a meeting of the CPPCC. He was happy, 'I didn't think I could still be a member of the CPPCC. His new wife (a nurse), said: 'You don't be happy too early, you hurt too many people. I'm afraid many of the members of the CPPCC are your fears, see how you can account!' \\nIntoxicated said: 'Anyway, whoever I am, I apologize for the reward.' \\nHe said to me, 'Although I say this, I still have no courage to go to the meeting.' \\nHe went to a meeting of the CPPCC, and before the meeting, he shake hands one by one. Others have said laughter, talk, he is embarrassed, wanted to find a corner to hide. It happens that a monk is also a member of the CPPCC, sitting in a corner. Intoxicated thinking about the monk had nothing to do with me, sitting next to the monk. \\nThe monk said, 'Oh, Commissioner Shen, you come.' \\nThis monk is called giant praise. Giant praise when retreat by the Yellow River, he went no way, he scolded: 'Suffering the army bastard, let us go out of the family also go no way!' \\nJust next to three KMT officers: 'Who were you scolding?' \\nJuzan said: 'I said that the Central Army did not resist, causing us to flee south.' \\nOne of the officers said, 'I do not look at the face of your monk, and I will kill you! How do you curse the CSKA? You know who I am? I'm just intoxicated!' After that, slapped the monk two slaps, and scolded, 'You get out! I don't read Buddha. Kill you!' Kicked the monk one foot again. \\nGiant praise monk said before and after intoxication, intoxication is remembered, there is so. Hurry to apologize: 'Oops, I'm sorry for you.' \\nGiant praise said, 'No, no, you kick this foot well. Originally I didn't want to participate in the war. I was beaten by you that day, the more I wanted to get angry when I read the Scripture at night, the Kuomintang was too bastard! I was determined to find you avengeance. Exactly Ye Jianying went to Wutaishan. I met Ye Jianying, talking up, saying that I wanted to find revenge for the KMT. Ye Jianying said: 'Out of your family to do good work, you don't have to fight, you can be an ambulance team.' This giant praise monk raised the flag of the ambulance team, recruited to buy horses, followed the Eighth Route Army to rescue the wounded. Therefore, he became a member of the CPPCC after liberation. \\n'Your foot kicked me here as a member.' \\nAt this time, the United Front Minister came over and saw the addicted monk laughing, and asked, 'How are you so happy?' \\nIntoxicated said: 'I didn't expect to meet acquaintances.' \\nThe United Front War Minister said: 'Shen, we are also old friends. You and I forgot? When you followed me in Chongqing, fortunately one night I ran away from the backhouse, or I didn't have me today.' \\nDrunk said: 'I'm sorry for you guys, I must have done a good check.' \\nJu Zan monk said: 'You are wrong, member Shen. Today, the common people let you, members of the CPPCC, not let you do inspections. You are the master, and give the country a good idea.' \\nAt the meeting, intoxicated to take the floor. said, 'I ask for sin from the people of the nation, and I will surely bear sin and make merit.' \\nAfter several of our 'biographical literature' founders were pedaled out, we learned that many people want to make intoxicated movies, intoxication is choosing. And I said to Shen, 'Your story can be made in movies and television. It's best to make a movie first.' \\nIntoxicated immediately said, 'Good! How about it? We work together?' And asked: 'Who is good for?' \\nI said, 'Still to the people of the old liberated areas, I am familiar with the people of the long shadow.' \\nHe said, 'Well, you are my plenipotentiary.' \\nI started writing the script, a total of 18-curtains. I thought about it for a long time and wrote him as a good man? Not good; old account? It's also bad. I do have a lot of brains. \\nIn order to write the script, I went to Chongqing to find Huaziliang. Hua Ziliang is an underground party member in Chongqing. However, the Chongqing Municipal Committee thinks that his historical loopholes are exhaustive and did not give him conclusions. I went to Chongqing Municipal Committee for the first time, very unpopular. I asked Hua Ziliang in which unit is now in? \\nThe people of the municipal committee said, 'Just in our unit.' \\nI said, 'I write a film script and need to find him.' \\nHe asked, 'Did you pass through the central?' \\nI said: 'I passed the film bureau,Through the long shadow,In the future the script will also pass the central censorship,Now mainly to play screenplay。' \\nHe said, 'Hua Ziliang has no jobs with us, no positions.' \\nI'm strange: 'Red Rock' wrote him, very famous!' \\n'We have no conclusions about his history,' he said. So he doesn't have a job right now. You can meet.' \\nI am afraid that Hua Ziliang has any historical question, and asked, 'Do you have any doubts about him?' \\nHe said: 'We didn't make conclusions, what do you write, get to him about the situation, it's better to master a little proportional. \\nI was an old friend of Lu Yi with Long Shadow director Wang Jiayi. He was also familiar with Long Shadow Gao Hongmagpie. I told them, 'I have told the intoxication, so that I can sign on his behalf. Now I give the script to the long shadow, okay? Intoxicated has agreed that I and his daughter are the author, I write. \\nThey said, 'It's too good. You represent, we sign the contract.' So I signed the contract with long pictures on behalf of the intoxication. \\nWang Jia-B came to a filming team, the team leader named Fu Kee. On the first day, Fu invited, I introduced him to the intoxication. The next day, intoxicated guests. We said well, first go to Chongqing to shoot the scum cave, call Huaziliang, first shoot the scene where the two of them reunited in the scum cave. \\nI told Fu Kee on the phone of Hua Ziliang, I also asked Haohua Ziliang to come to Beijing and go to Chongqing Tre Cave together. Hua Ziliang said: 'I will come next week.' I said call me before you come to Beijing. \\nI've been waiting at home for almost half a month, no news. I called the intoxicated home, and I asked, 'Is Hua sick?' \\nThe dazzling lady asked with surprise: 'How are you still in Beijing?' \\nI asked, 'Shen old?' \\nShe said, 'Shen old, they all went to film.' \\nI was surprised: 'Ah? Where did they shoot?' \\n'They went to Chongqing scum cave again.' The original Fu Kee put the intoxication, Hua Ziliang all picked up. 'Fook said you were sick, hospitalized, didn't notify you, they took it first.' Drunk lady said so. \\nPush me up! \\nI was not hospitalized at all, they dumped me. I think of 'Biographical Literature.' I said, 'I don't deal with anybody of you.' I didn't give all the script to Fouk, they didn't make this movie. Later, it seemed to have taken a documentary in order to cope with the superiors. This movie is 'yellow'. \\nThird, the transfer of Chen Lifu's proposal for cross-Strait cooperation was rejected.\\nThis is the third thing I did after my leave. In 1983, some people in Taiwan came to talk to the central government about cooperation. I pull the line from it. Some people advised me, 'Your overseas overseas relations are complicated. Now you're going to pull the line in Taiwan again, that's okay! Do not break this woe!' \\nA man named Luo Kai Tung is a representative of the Cultural Newspaper in Hong Kong. He came to me through my niece in Hong Kong, saying that a friend from Taiwan gave him a letter to him, hoping that I would help transfer it to the Central Committee. \\nI don't think there is nothing to transfer letters, just say you take it. \\nHe did not expect that what he brought was a letter from Chen Lifu, a senior official of the Presidential Office of the Kuomint Chen Lifu once admired Zhou Enlai. Zhou Enlai called 'Chen Lifu is an enemy worthy of respect.' Later, Chen Lifu showed great concern and interest in the reunification of the two sides of the Straits. In 1975, Chen Lifu sent a message of invitation to Mao Zedong to Taiwan through secret channels. But at that time, the mainland was at the time of the 'Cultural Revolution', and this proposal should not respond. This letter also proposed cross-Strait cooperation. I sent this letter to the overseas Chinese office. What I thought was to turn up through Liao Chengzhi. \\nBut the overseas Chinese office said: 'No, if something happens, we can't stand it.' OOC refused to turn again. \\nI also wrote congratulations, hoping to pass through him to the Central Committee. But congratulations are not in Beijing. \\nLater, I spoke to Wu Jiang (formerly the Singapore Overseas Chinese Party, and later in Yan'an, deputy president of China News Agency and director of the Nanhai Film Studio), about this matter. He said, 'This is a good thing, why not? You sent a letter to me, I gave to the Central Federation.' \\nCentral Department received a letter, not very reassured, put me and Wujiang to find, asked: Luo Qidong is what identity? \\nI said, 'This letter is true or false, it is good or bad, and your central authorities decide.' \\nThey asked, 'Do you advocate not to communicate and then meet?' \\nI said, 'I think it's good or bad, come to know. Do not touch at all, how do you know that he is good or bad?' \\nAfter consideration, the CPC Department met Luo Qidong under the name of the Taiwan Research Institute. Wu Jiang and I also attended the meeting. Luo Qidong said: He has an uncle, Luo Wenping, a KMT chief (retired), and has a very good relationship with Chen Lifu. Chen Lifu believes that the two sides of the Straits should cooperate. Luo Wenping asked him to write a letter to the CPC Central Committee: 'I give it to you.' \\nChen Lifu's letter suggested that cross-Strait cooperation starts with the economy first, and draft a 100 billion overseas Chinese bank. If mainland China has difficulty funding, Taiwan lends half, it can do it up. Another proposal is that the Taiwan Agriculture Council has a promising development and experience that can help the mainland develop the Sanjiang Plains (Heilongjiang, Mudanjiang, Songhua River), and Taiwan to invest in, out of technicians, lay half of the grain. \\nTaiwan said: 'If there is any opinion, it is not convenient to talk in the mainland, you can talk abroad, or Singapore, or Thailand, or Japan.' \\nAfter this meeting, the next day, I asked for someone from the Taiwan Office and Wu Jiang to send a message: 'We have taken up the relationship, and your task ends here.' Throw us again. \\nLater, our people met Wu Jiang and told him, 'By doing this, don't Taiwan become the initiative! Doing a bank, and the Sanjiang Plain, is tantamount to promoting Taiwan, and we will not talk about this matter anymore.' \\nRejecting the first cross-Strait cooperation proposal. \\nFourth, wrote the script of nine heroic diplomats, Ding Guan Gene does not let propaganda\\nThis is the fourth thing I did after my leave. When I worked at the Ministry of Civil Affairs's Revolutionary History Lab, I came into contact with such a past. During the war of resistance, a ship of fiat currency was shipped from the United States to Nanjing to support China's resistance war. The boat broke when it arrived in the Philippines, stopped for repair. The Japanese want to intercept the bank notes. \\nThe nine diplomats at the Nanjing government embassy in the Philippines are all overseas Chinese. They tried every effort to protect the ship's banknotes. When they found out that they were unable to do so, they burned the ship with the banknotes. Prefer to burn it, and not let the banknotes fall into the hands of the Japanese. \\nThe Japanese talked to these nine diplomats and said that if they issued a declaration, supported Wang Jingwei and were friendly to Japan, they would still be diplomats. Nine diplomats said: 'We are Chinese, you are invaders. We will surely fight against you!' \\nThe next day, the Japanese changed their face and forced to 'hand over the money!' \\nThe Japanese said, 'I heard you burned the boat?' \\nThe Consul said: 'There was no whole burning, but left a little bit.' Say, take out the rest of the ticket corner from the pocket. \\nThe Japanese are angry: 'I want to shoot you!' \\nThe Consul said: 'The Chinese burn money from the Chinese is irrelevant to you.' \\nThey neither support Wang Jingwei nor surrender to the Japanese. The Japanese took them up and tortured. Nine diplomats did not shake. The Japanese brought their wife and said, 'This is the last time you meet. You persuade them to surrender, or they will be shot tomorrow. \\nThe consul's lady said to the Consul: 'I am honorable, I can marry you. When I was a girl, I didn't pick the wrong person, I really picked you right. I tell you, the end of your struggle, I'm not afraid of being a widow, I am the wife of an improper traitor!' Japanese popularity is broken. \\nThe next day, the Japanese shot nine overseas diplomats. When they were shot, they were not dead, and they were buried alive. The tragic scene was seen by guerrillas hiding in the dark. Because it was illegal to shoot diplomats, at night, the Japanese transferred their bodies. \\nAfter Japan surrendered, several Japanese officers who killed nine diplomats were captured by us, but they denied the fact of killing diplomats, when the guerrillas came to testify and took the way to find the remains. \\nBoth sides of the Strait acknowledged that the nine diplomats were martyrs, and the Kuomintang admitted that our Communist Party also acknowledged. \\nI didn't know about it at first. When I was leaving the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the son and daughter of the consular came to the Ministry of Civil Affairs and said, 'We should send us a martyr certificate' and sent the relevant information. So I know the sad story of nine diplomats in that year. I don't believe. What do I think about this heroic KMT member? Some Communist Party members can't do it. And I said to the consul's family, 'I turn your opinion up.' I sent the material to the minister, who said, 'It is true or false to investigate this matter first.' \\nI said that the investigation was a good investigation. I was familiar with the Philippine party books, and I was familiar with the Philippine Overseas Chinese Office, and I could be clear when I asked. \\nI first asked Liang Shangyuan, secretary of the Philippine Party. Liang Shangyuan said: 'A few of them are good, great and have not surrendered.' \\nBut the brave nine diplomats have little material. After understanding, I found that their materials were lost, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan. I collected materials everywhere through my friends, through the Federation of Overseas Chinese Unions, collected for 10 years, wrote a script, written for 8 years. \\nWhen you want to shoot this film, Hong Kong director Wu Siyuan proposed that it is not very meaningful to bring together the performing arts circles of the mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong? However, our mainland did not agree to shoot this film. At that time, Ding Guan Gen, Minister of Propaganda of the CPC Central Committee, said: This is a matter of the Kuomintang and cannot be propagated. \\nOriginally, Wujiang said, 'I will shoot this film', but it has not taken long,"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": " the Nanhai Film Studio was dissolved and Wujiang died shortly. \\nAfter I left my body, I always wanted to do something useful for the people and for the motherland, to compensate for those days that had been delayed, but I didn't do it. \\nThis is really, the years of dissolence, a long sigh! \\nChapter 13: My overseas comrades are dead\\nOne, I'm still good. I survived.\\nThere are basically two kinds of people that overseas Chinese go overseas. One is poor people who have no living way to flee to the South Ocean. This is the majority; one is that they can't stay in the domestic revolution, and run to the South Ocean, this is the minority. Before the war, Thailand had 300-3.5 million overseas Chinese, of which there were about 100 or more than 200 communist members. About 5% of the hair family in Thailand. More than 90% are lower, that is, pull yellow charter, when hard to lift boxes, lift cargo, ship unloading and unloading. Of these, 80--90% are illiterate. At that time, going to the Nanyang, called 'passing through' and calling the overseas Chinese 'Fanzai', that is, these poor people. \\nThe 5% of the fortune is generally collusion with local powerful and powerful people. For example, your land granted to me, I am responsible for managing, earning money together. Then there is the use of foreign passports. Thailand was a semi-colony, and the Netherlands, Britain and Japan had consulates, and their people violated the law. Thailand could not do so and must be the responsibility of its own consulates. So Thai people bought foreign passports and made a 'fake foreigner', openly smoke, open casinos, open red light zones, buy and sell women, hold foreign passports, and the Thai government could not manage. \\nThat said, although 90 per cent are poor people, but they do not die of starvation, there are rice and fish. \\nThe overseas Chinese in the past were unable to survive to break the Nanyang, as if they were sold piglets. Overseas Chinese grew up, but became a pig eight rings, pig eight rings in the mirror, not people inside and outside. The greatest suffering of our overseas Chinese is that they are not people inside and outside. \\nOutside, the Thai Government sees us as agents of Mao Zedong. Actually, it's really hard to say. It is said that there are no people who let us participate in any agent organization, and no one has made us any intelligence, but what we do is indeed support for the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, saying we are not wrong with anything. \\nBut we have worked hard to return to our homeland, saying that we are special agents sent by the Thai government and the United States. Look at the early liberation movie, 'overseas people' are overseas Chinese, all agents. Not only that, but as long as anyone has an overseas relationship, it will not work. 'Earth, rich, anti, bad, right, overseas Chinese', who linked 'overseas Chinese' to 'earth, rich, anti, bad, right'? I don't know, but this 'overseas Chinese' is more horrible and more powerful than 'land, rich, anti-anti-bad, right'. As long as they have overseas relations, they are not credible. Don't say 'overseas Chinese'. If communicating with overseas, it is considered a foreign country, and as for overseas Chinese, it is not available. As long as you hang a 'overseas Chinese' word, we don't have to talk about anything, study, work, nothing. \\nChen Boda said: Where is the most overseas Chinese, where is the place where the most agents are. What is Overseas Chinese? It is lychee, red skin, white meat, black heart, get one, is a bunch of. \\nI started with young people, almost no home, and wholeheartedly participated in the party struggle. As a result, I went back to China for two decades. I survived well, many of my comrades were dead. Liang Chuan-shen died in a war with the Japanese, and Chen Lihui was killed in the events in South Anhui. This is also good. Many of my comrades died under their own knife after returning home. My comrades died, and until now Thailand's family is waiting for them to come home. I went back to Thailand and everyone came to me: How about the people who went with you? How am I answering? \\nWhat should the overseas Chinese look like this? I think, first, that the overseas Chinese are patriotic and contribute a great deal to the motherland. Second, the experience of the overseas Chinese is very tragic and politically dispossessed. The overseas Chinese do a lot of work, but the consequences are bad, and this is the true situation of overseas Chinese. \\nEngels believes overseas Chinese is the most reusable. Dr Sun Yat-sen called overseas Chinese 'the mother of revolution.' At the beginning of the resistance war, Mao Zedong personally inscribed 'Overseas Chinese must unite, and the Chinese Communist Party is willing to establish a united front with overseas Chinese.' Mao Zedong also gave Chen Jiageng Shu Li Biography Said he was a flag of overseas Chinese. \\nBut the 'Cultural Revolution' put Chen Jiageng whip the corpse, saying he is a big vampire \\nThe overseas Chinese have no motherland. We are overseas, known as 'overseas orphans', the KMT does not protect us and the Thai government does not recognize us. Only in 1973, China established diplomatic ties with Thailand. Thailand simply despises the Chinese and believes that China is behind Thailand. \\nThere are more than 500 people in Thailand who went to the Whampoa Military Academy, sacrificed more than 300 people, and more than 200 people went back to Thailand to do overseas Chinese or do business. No one was wronged. And we're different, death is too much. Are we wrong? Bei Wei Junyi was wrong, Wei Junyi just couldn't be an American scholar, we were dead. \\nI was pretty good, survived, many overseas Chinese helped us lay down the mountains and the result was wronged to death. \\nSecond, more than 100 comrades including Wu Linman were shot by Ho Chi Minh as a 'French agent'\\nAt that time, he was going to Yan'an, without being approved, arranged for him to go to Vietnam for the revolution and help Ho Chi Minh fight against the United States. As a result, Ho Chi Minh turned his face and shot more than 100 Chinese comrades in the Vietnamese Communist Party collectively! Say that more than 100 comrades are French agents. After that, the relevant Chinese departments did not dare to praise these comrades, do not dare to come forward to speak out, afraid Ho Chi Minh will turn his face. The families of these comrades became the families of the counter-revolutionary. \\nThat's how Wu Lemman, who led me during the revolution in Thailand, was shot by the Vietnamese Communist Party. When Japan was about to surrender, he was going to Yan'an. He was ready to go to Yan'an. Suddenly, the organization informed him: 'You are overseas Chinese, the task is heavy, you will Vietnam again, you go to Vietnam.' He went to work at the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security, and he was shot dead by Ho Chi Minh as a French agent. He was one of more than 100 comrades. Our comrades in question were very irresponsible, and could have proved that Wu Linman was sent out, but he said, 'Don't know, don't look for me.' Afraid of offending Ho Chi Minh, afraid to lose the yarn hat \\nWu Linman's wife, daughter-in-law, and son-in-law sold blood and made some road fees to Beijing. Xu Xia and I came forward to help them fight lawsuits until the central government, asking, 'Do you want overseas Chinese? This treatment of overseas Chinese, who still embraces you?' Flip the face. Later, Hu Yaobang was found, only given the rehabilitation, at that time it was already 1982. To say that it was rehabilitated, the conclusion was only death due to official service. \\nAlas, Wu Linman shouted 'Long live the Communist Party' when he was shot dead. \\nHow did the more than 100 overseas comrades be rehabilitated? \\nOn the day of the shooting of more than 100 comrades, dare to say it was shot, lying about a gathering meeting, these comrades did not know the inside, they assembled together. One of the comrades was sick, did not go to the collection, and soon he heard the wind in the hospital, ran away, and that survived. He was choked enough in the Cultural Revolution. The charge was that more than 100 people were agents, but you were not an agent? After the 'Cultural Revolution', finally gave him a punitive, confirming that he was not an agent. So the families of the comrades who were shot to find him and asked him to prove. And the final conclusion given to these 100 comrades was: 'died on duty.' Neither recognize the martyrs nor say that you are not families of the counter-revolutionary. You said it was wrong? \\nThird, the little girl in Hainan Island was shot after acting\\nI had a comrade, and I was shot with a joke. This is a little girl, acting. Formerly a member of our Thai Women's Salvation Council. Originally she was going to Yan'an, and she said, 'Hainan Island needs people. You are a Hainan island, go to Hainan Island.' On one occasion she played in Hainan Island, she played an agent in the show. After stepping down, she was called to come over:\\n'Who sent you?' \\nShe thought it was a joke, and she said jokingly: 'The Thai government sent.' \\n'What are you doing?' \\nShe continued joking: 'I'm an agent.' \\nImmediately shot. You said absurd not absurd? \\nLater her lover wrote an article: 'Dark Self Injury'. \\nFourth, Huang Xuesheng was hanged in the 'Cultural Revolution'\\nHuang Xuesheng originally called Huang Jasper, we called her sister Abi. \\nI separated myself from Huang Jueseng for a long time. One time she met in Beijing, she asked me to see Li Hua. I said no, I became the right. She said, 'What right, where do you get so many right? Take comrades as the right, lack of virtue.' \\nI was in Jilin, and she asked, 'Can you Jilin eat a full meal?' 'The ordinary people have not had to eat leaves, starved many people, and said the great leap forward.' At that time, she was a member of the provincial committee, and it was not easy to see that. The Cultural Revolution makes it clearer: the Cultural Revolution is wrong. As a result, her historical problems came up again, saying she was a traitor. She killed herself! I guess she felt there was no future. \\nHuang Xuesheng family is very rich. She was 15 years old from Thailand to Shantou and attended the regiment. When Zhou Enlai led the Nanchang uprising team to Shantou, she organized student support and was arrested. Her brother, a capitalist, bought her out with the ocean and sent her back to Thailand. She joined the party in Thailand. In 1937 she brought nine people to Yan'an. Along the way, go to the Eighth Route Army Office in Liao Shing Chi, Hong Kong. It is up to the office to decide whether you go to the Dongjiang column, to the new four army, or to Yan'an, to see which road is good to go at that time. \\nHuang Xuesheng, nine of them go north together, the goal is too big, decided to walk two or three. Huang Xuesheng, Zhuang Jiangsheng, Ma Song first came to the new four army, and then to Yan'an. The other six people remained in the new four army (the six people were sacrificed in the events in South Anhui Province. Mason was sick in the previous years). \\nAfter she went to Yan'an, she studied in the anti-university and anti-big graduation, in order to train her, let her go to female college. After graduating from college, she went to the Thai team of the CPC Overseas Working Committee. \\nAfter Huang Juesheng went to Yan'an, her husband, Li Hua, married Lin Mu-mu, the daughter of the big capitalist. Lin was their comrade. Huang Juesheng left a child over one year old, called Mama Lin. \\nI think, what to do if Huang Xuesheng comes back in the future? However, it was also difficult to say at that time that resistance to Japan was distant, and the Eighth Route Army could not come out in the mountain structure. When Huang Xuesheng could come back, it is hard to say. \\nHuang Xuesheng and Lin Mu-Mu are two kinds of personality. Huang Xuesheng simple and simple, research theory, like Lu Xun's article, also often go back to the country; Lin Mu Mu likes to play the piano, on the museum. We are poor without money, we look for Lin Mu Mu Mu: 'Go, go, eat.' She asked us to go to the hall. \\nIn Yan'an, Huang Xuesheng helped me many times. \\nAfter Japan surrendered, I and Huang Xuesheng went all the way to the northeast, and then found ways to turn back to Thailand for the revolution. But Huang said, 'I don't go, work here needs.' \\nI think it's strange that I went to Yan'an as she gave me the idea, saying that Yan'an exercise was for a better revolution in the future and back of Thailand. Now, how can she not return to Thailand? I thought she was afraid to go back to meet Li Hua and Lin Mu-mu. Nor did I barely. \\nActually, she thinks deeper than me. At that time, inside the Thai Communist Party, some people objected: 'We can't do this. This is not a revolution, it is a flaw.' So she asked me, 'Old Europe, are you going back?' \\nI said, 'Party go, why not go back?' \\n'I'm not going back,' she said. Have you thought about it? We're back to Thailand, right? Didn't you feel anything wrong with going back?' It means that we are not so wrong in Thailand, it's better to be honest about the revolution in China. \\nShe said: 'This can't be done so. China's road is not accessible to every country, depending on the specific situation.' Huang Xuesheng thinks that the Thai people do not have the consciousness of revolutionary, and they do not want to engage in Marxinism or to engage in the Communist Party's demands. It is not useful for us to go to the revolution, but can only add trouble to people. It is like a person who has not yet found a request for an object, just let him combine with communism. This is not possible, and we will surely fail. \\nAnd she asked me, 'Do you go back to Thailand to find Zhang Qingchuan?' \\nI said, 'Of course looking. Without Zhang Qingchuan, I could not see Ho Chi Minh, Zhou Enlai, and I could not reach Yan'an. He introduced me to go to Ho Chi Minh before I can go to Yan'an. Back to Thailand, I'm looking for him first, that's right.' \\nShe said, 'You don't look for him anymore.' \\n'Why?' \\nHe has not done it. \\nI was surprised to ask Huang Juesheng, she did not say. \\nI asked her, 'Don't go back to Thailand, where are you going?' \\n'I have not decided yet, I'm not going to the south anyway.' \\nShe stayed in the northeast and later became the propaganda minister of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the CPC. \\nAt that time, the Northeast had just liberated and needed people very much. We pass through a county in the northeast, hold a convention to publicize what the Communist Party is doing, what the Kuomintang is doing, and we left our six comrades behind when we finish the conference. At that time, if I don't go ahead, leave you immediately, job pick you up. \\nHuang Xuesheng was a comrade who had earlier consciousness. Because at that time, if he proposed not to do so in Thailand, you were thought to be afraid of death, not to engage in armed struggle, fear sacrifice. \\nWe broke up in Zhangjiakou in 1946, long after we haven't met. Later I learned that she went to Yanji, and later in Shenyang, where she became deputy minister of propaganda and deputy minister of culture of the Liaoning Provincial Committee, married the Minister of Finance of Liaoning Province. One of her subordinates in the propaganda department of the Liaoning Provincial Committee is Zhang Zhixin, who was cut his throat in the Cultural Revolution. \\nIn 1962, I brought my eldest daughter to Beijing to see a hospital, and met Huang Xuesheng in front of Tongrentang when I bought a medicine for my daughter. How many years have not met, she is meeting in Beijing. She was delighted, saying, 'Li Hua is back, working at the Foreign Ministry, Mu Mu also returned, both of them already have a daughter.' \\nThen she said, You go with me. \\n'On where?' \\n'Go on Lihua there.' \\nI never went with people since I had drawn the right, and I said that my daughter was sick and could not go. \\n'Go, Mu Milao mentions you and want to see you.' \\n'I'm different now, you are all party leaders, and you're not convenient to talk to me there.' I said. \\n'You go, we never treat you as an outsider.' She had to let me go. \\nLi Hua was the Director of the Asian Department of Foreign Affairs at that time. Huang Juesheng and Lin Mu-mu have talked to me a lot, saying that we leap forward, starve people, out of the masses, proud, and also said that Stalin was a tyrant, murdered people, etc., and so on, made a lot of whirl I am amazed, how can Huang Xuesheng a cadre of the provincial committee be complaining like this? How did she think so powerful? It turned out to be wholeheartedly for the party, and what is being said now was clearly seen at the time as the same party centrifugal. More right than the right. \\nHuang said to me again, Do not lift your head, not so many right-wing. Our Thai comrades don't believe that there are so many right, especially you are the right. I'm too far away. Liaoning can't handle Jilin. You can go find Zhou Jiefen. Zhou Jiefen does not believe that there are so many right-wing parties. What is the difficulty you find him.' I laugh. \\nIn the future, I did not meet with Huang Juesheng again, and I also voted for communications. \\nI returned to Beijing in 1979 after screening and called Li Hua and Lin Mu-Mu, asking Huang Juesheng okay? They said Huang Jue was alive and dead. \\nAt the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Zhang Zhixin questioned some practices of the Cultural Revolution. She said her views to Huang Xuesheng. Huang said to Zhang Zhixin: 'Do not mess.' Later, Zhang Zhixin said his views to another lesbian. This lesbian revealed Zhang Zhixin and said that Huang Juesheng and Zhang Zhixin were a group. So, Huang Xuesheng and Zhang Zhixin together, were sent to Panjin Kan School and lived in a house. \\nAt this time, 'old things are repeated', and one bite concluded that Huang Xuesheng's arrest was surrendered, 'otherwise why can you survive? You are a traitor, a traitor leading the counter-revolutionary Zhang Zhixin!' \\nHuang Xuesheng was fighting very badly. In the evening of 1969, when Zhang Zhixin was brought to trial, Huang Xuesheng also pulled away: 'How must you account for the mutiny? How to collusion Zhang Zhixin?' Huang Xuesheng came out first, when he came out, Huang Xuesheng gave his scarf to Zhang Zhixin, saying: 'The days are too cold, I don't need.' \\nZhang Zhixin has been tried until dawn before coming back. A touch pit, cast someone. Where did Wong go? Everyone went everywhere, in the woods, and saw Huang Xuesheng hanging on the tree. Zhang Zhixin found a note in Huang's washbasin: 'I'm not a traitor'! \\nAlas! Huang Juesheng took part in the revolution as a teenager! \\nFive, Cai Chuyun is desperately persecuted and committed suicide\\nWu Zhizhi participated in the new cultural movement from the beginning of '5. 4' until his death at the age of 90. He was Shantou and was the first member of Shantou. His wife Cai Chuyun was the first female member of Shantou. They took part in the activities of the delegation in 1924 and later joined the party. They used to be a group with Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao. \\nWu Zhizhi is the first secretary of the Thai Communist Party since its reconstruction in 1934. When in Shantou, the Great Revolution failed. Zhou Enlai started to engage in the Soviet government north. Some medical numbers did not follow. As long as they had ties in the South Ocean, they went to the South Ocean. Wu Zhizhi had a brother in Thailand, so he went to Thailand. At that time, his wife Cai Chuyun had the first child (Cai Cheng), and could not keep up with the team, he returned to Shantou's family. After giving birth to the child, Cai Chu-yun also went to Thailand to work as a secret telegram, and there was exactly a child as cover. However, as a result of the implementation of the blind route, only leaflets, marches, were arrested soon and the two were deported. In the future, he was sent to do underground work in Shanghai and Hong Kong. As liaisons between our party and overseas Chinese, they have done a lot of work for the overseas Chinese. During the civil war, they helped Pan Hannian and Liao Chengzhi to send many cultural people out of Hong Kong. On the eve of the founding of the new China, they sent a large number of people to Beijing for the CPPCC meeting. The two of them are really hard work. \\nAfter the establishment of 'New China', Ho Chi Minh became Counsellor of the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam. He has been working at embassies in Vietnam and Indonesia. Or do overseas Chinese work. Wu Zhizhi has been insisting on the 'cultural revolution.' One is to do the work of the Overseas Chinese Party for Communist International, and the other is to do the work of the Chinese Communist Party. \\nAt the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Wu Zhizhi was the principal of the Overseas Chinese School in Fujian, adjacent to Shantou. Cai Chuyun was the second principal and secretary of the Party Committee. The overseas Chinese school is described as a 'black shop' dedicated to training future generations for capitalists, making Wu Zhizhi and Cai Chuyun into 'capitalists' and 'reactionary academic authority.' The most damn thing is that Cai Chuyun knew Jiang Qing when he was in Shanghai, knew Jiang Qing's substrate, and Jiang Qing said that all people who knew me fine would not stay one. In this way, Wu Zhizhi and Cai Chu-yun were caught up, saying that they had been arrested, or still overseas Chinese, to cultivate future generations for capitalists, and blame and fled. \\nWu Zhi was fighting for three years, closed for three years, tortured. Cai Chuyun was humiliated and committed suicide. \\nSix, 'Mulan' was forced to death and whip the corpse\\nWhen I brought eight people from Thailand to Yan'an, I was looking for a car in Kunming to Chongqing. I worked with the driver and made friends with overseas Chinese drivers. People tell me: there is really a good thing in our overseas Chinese. There is a Myanmar overseas Chinese driver Lee Yuemei, known as 'Mulan.' She dressed in menswear, enrolled as a driver, first learned to drive a car from her brother, and then enrol in the army. Once, her car transported ammunition to go ninety thirteen bends (Kunming to Chongqing there is a road called nine qu thirteen bends, the hardest to walk, known as 'hanging cliff'), the mid-levels overturned, and people rescued her, she had become unconscious. During the rescue, the doctor found out that she was a woman. The doctor was moved and tried to treat it. Later the doctor married 'Mulan'. \\nWhile still in Thailand, Wu Limman was sent to Vietnam by the Thai Communist Party to host the Communist Party's 'For All'. Once he came back to Thailand and heard that I was going to Yan'an, congratulated me and gave me a special journalist ID for the National newspaper. In Kunming, I heard the story of Li Yuemei, I went to interview her. But she was not there and said she had moved to Guizhou. Later I passed through Guizhou and came across 'Mulan' Li Yuemei. \\nAfter the Cultural Revolution, we talked about overseas Chinese drivers, I asked about 'Mulan'. People told me she committed suicide. \\nOriginally, after 'Mulan' hurt, improper driver, has been engaged in the convoy logistics, as a nurse. After the victory of the resistance, the KMT sent her back to Myanmar. She returned to Myanmar with three children. After the founding of the country, Premier Zhou visited Myanmar and heard the story of 'Mulan' and specifically found her, told her that she needed to educate her children well and asked her to send the child to China. \\nMulan really takes her child to China, and she opened a coffee shop in a small place between Myanmar and Kunming, and business is OK. \\nAfter the start of the Cultural Revolution, all the overseas Chinese drivers on the Shen Burma highway in that year were said to be KMT agents sent by the United States, because they were the establishment of the Kuomintang army and were tasked to transport arms. This is the overseas Chinese convoy organized by Chen Jiageng. Although wearing KMT military uniforms, the KMT has provided them very little. It is the overseas Chinese donations to them to buy sweaters and medicines. 'Mulan', of course, was also attacked. When the villains copied her house, they found her Kuomintang uniforms at her house. That is, she said she was an 'American agent' and smashed her coffee shop and twisted her to the farm to transform. \\n'Mulan' is not convinced, can not open a shop, but can not treat me as a correctional prisoner. She resisted firmly and one day she killed herself with a sickle. \\nAfter Mulan's suicide, the villain also asked her three children to criticize her next to her body, whipping her body, saying she was confronted with the Communist Party. \\nVII. Tragedy of the Filipino Guerrillas\\nThere is also a guerrilla detachment of overseas Chinese in the Philippines, all made up of overseas Chinese to fight Japan. There are 20 detachments of the Philippines guerrilla detachment, five detachments that were actually destroyed by the Japanese, and the remaining 15 detachments have persisted to the final victory and turned the Japanese to fizzy. When Japan surrendered, the first to raise the red flag in the Philippines was the overseas Chinese detachment. The United States supported the Philippine overseas Chinese detachment to fight Japan, gave them guns and ammunition, clothes and medicines. The 15 detachments were later described as mercenaries of the United States. Many of these overseas Chinese were killed in the 'Cultural Revolution' after their return home. The overseas Chinese commemorated them, and wrote to them a couplets: 'For the Party for the people, for the people, with outstanding merit; and the rape of mercenaries within the agents, there is no dark day'. They did not die in the hands of the Japanese, but in their own hands. \\nEight, the heart of the baby died as the right\\nQiu Xinbao was the most famous Chinese journalist in the Overseas Chinese Daily when he was in Thailand. He was expelled from the Thai government and went to Shantou City, China, as Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Committee. 'We all love the party very much and care about the party. Now the party has given us this opportunity, let us speak all our heart, give advice to the Party and help the party to rectify.' Therefore, everyone made comments, for example, not enough care about overseas Chinese, taking over the houses of overseas Chinese, and so on. Whosoever says more opinions, who is the right, Qiu Xinbao is the fomenting fire, and becomes the 'great right'. \\nAfter he became the right, he did not talk to anyone, and others dared not to go with him. Finally he spit blood and died of gas. \\nBefore his death, he said to his lover, 'Take my ashes back to Thailand.' Chill, the heart is dead. \\nNine, Zhou Jiefen jumped and committed suicide\\nZhou Jie-wen joined me in Thailand to revoke the revolution. Later than I went to Yan'an first, graduated from the North Shaanxi Public School and was ready to go south to Thailand, but this road did not work, only to the northeast. Later, he became Chairman of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, director of the CPC Provincial Committee and Minister of United War. After being classified as the right, I went to Jilin to transform and take care of and help me. He was married in the Northeast, and his lover was Korean, home in South Korea. The Cultural Revolution says that he is an agent and a traitor sent by Liu Shaoqi. He was instructed by Liu Shaoqi to sell half of Changbaishan to North Korea, caught him up and tortured. On May 4, 1969, Zhou Jiefen dressed neatly, shaved a beard and killed himself from the 4th floor. \\nTen, I woke up completely in the 'six four'\\nI conclude by saying the 'Six Four Events' of 1989. My home lives on the 9th floor of the building opposite the front door and Tiananmen Square in Beijing. From my house you can see Tiananmen Square at a glance. I saw the students out there and began to feel, 'What? No meaning.' Wu Tong passed through me and asked me at my house, 'Old Europe, what education are you receiving?' \\nI said, 'What education!' \\n'I was inspired,' he said. \\nThat night, Wu Tong and I completed the book 'Record of Soul', which reflects the deeds of the Chinese Chinese revolution. I said:\\n'Let's go and see what the students are doing?' \\nWe took a few steps to Tiananmen Square and saw the students kneeling in front of the Great Hall of the People, holding a petition, demanding democracy and demanding the fight against corruption. We have two discussions: this requirement is not excessive, exactly the same as the demands of our past marches. We are calling for anti-Japanese democracy, and now students are asking for anti-corruption and anti-bureaucracy, right.' I donated the money to the students that day. Some selling pancakes give pancakes to students, don't have money. I marched with them without the money. \\nIn the evening, I heard that the troops had entered Beijing and the students were blocking tanks with roadblocks. I and a comrade (who was a driver when he resisted US aid North Korea and left off from the Ministry of Civil Affairs), on the 9 floors of my house, I suddenly heard the remote rang, and I said, 'Really will do propaganda, troops go into town, and also put firecrackers welcome.' \\nThe comrade said, 'You're still an old eight way. You listen to it. Is this firecracker sound? This is a machine gun. You old eight road, white.' I listen, it's a machine gun! I think, how did the PLA shoot the tank and hit the students? I couldn't accept it, then I couldn't stand up, paralyzed. \\nI lay in bed and thought a lot of questions. How can our troops, the Eighth Route Army, shoot the students? It doesn't make sense. \\nMy house stands downstairs some old lady. An old man wrote a sign: 'I'm a good man, don't shoot.'

I can't help but ask, are the people of Kunming City not our students themselves? To say that the only thing at the CCP level can 'shine' within the Central Committee is, why should it be publicly reported again? Yunda is the people's university. Our students are children and daughters of the people, so that our actions are now exposed to them, to seek their instructions and help. What is the bad thing? \\nSecond: Students will speak out to support everyone, what kind of support? Just ran behind the classmates, and was dragged to breathe look. Let's ask what questions students will have before the masses? Besides, many classmates organize wall papers, first of all economic problems. Second, energy becomes a question, the students will not ask. We suggest that students will help the Wall of Democracy to solve these problems, mainly financial aid and transcribers, as for editorial selection powers to be left entirely to the founders of these posters. \\nThirdly, you claim that this campaign cannot be reelected to the Committee. We think that no one wants to fight for power by knocking down a batch of ways. If there is a class committee that is really incompetent, and everyone asks for a change of election, what about you? Convince? Can't convince you to take repression? \\nIn general, we suggest that you take some more heads in this campaign, and less define some scope to constrain the masses. \\nThe above comments will be answered immediately. \\nYear 1, Department of Chinese\\nOu yangji Ji, Wang Liming, Li Guoliang, Fu Zemin, Zhang Zongli, etc. ('Right Facts and Deeds' by the Yunnan University Committee of the Communist Party of China (Part of the Right Word and Deeds), 1957.9\\n"},

There are still a lot of mistakes made by the working class; and the advanced figures of other classes are quite a few, which is the working class better? In fact, cadres of industrial and peasant origin have no leadership level. It is very unfair that they only occupy a position on the basis of their old qualifications. If they make mistakes, they push responsibility to the long or secretary. At the same time, people of good origin make mistakes are lighter, and intellectuals and old people make mistakes are heavier. Every time the sport intellectuals and the old people did typical criticism, and I was very discouraged. \\nCommunist members are not made of special materials, I do not recognize that communists are made of special materials. Party members are nothing special, similar to me; I am not satisfied with saying party members much higher than the masses; I do not believe that I am an eternal slave in morality, I will not have more than one party member. \\nFor many works of art, I most want to see a very typical mass hero. Why always see the party members better than the masses? It's hard to convincing. \\nFor so long liberation, who does not know progress?! Learn politics and participate in meetings to be voluntary. Why should I put the cord on the neck of the family? I strongly oppose this. The Communist Party is to do anything about it, and always say that it is voluntary according to consciousness, but when people really do not consciously, they are scolding people as backwards. Agricultural societies, for example, have repeatedly emphasized the principle of voluntarism, but in fact only voluntary admission and not voluntary non-admission. However, they (the Communist Party), do not punish you publicly, that is, they despise the sole household. I have seen more in the countryside, and the school is still like this. But in any case, all the voluntary I will not be willing to see how you put me! \\nI advocate absolute freedom, full freedom; I reject any restraint. I think of this freedom: I want to study, do not want to learn, I don't want to learn; when I'm happy to come at a meeting, I'm not happy to come. \\nThought backwardness is not equal to crime, I think that ideological transformation can not set the death system, meet at all; I advocate freedom of indulgence, because I do not want status, future, money...\\nI am not participating in any party in my life. I want to be a pure art painter, not to participate in the American Association, even if I put up stalls on the street, I will not obey any leader. China cannot find freedom, I will go to the capitalist country to breathe free air. \\nI am opposed to democratic centralization, and I am very dissatisfied with it. As long as liberation has elapsed, democracy should be larger, and concentration has become increasingly inappropriate, because it is incompatible with the increased awareness of the people, especially in schools, where there should be democracy and not concentration. \\nDo not look too mysterious to the Soviet Union. It is not all the same as the Soviet Union. I believe that Europe and America are the most developed cultures, and I will not study abroad in the Soviet Union in the future. \\nsaid: 'Hu Feng engaged in counter-revolutionary group is not good, but Shu Wu is even more shameful! You know his counterrevolution, why you have to follow him for more than 20 years, and why you want to sell others is shameful.' \\n[Yunnan University Committee of the Communist Party of China (Chinese Communist Party of China), 'Right Word and Deeds (Next Episode), Part of the Right School Students, September 1957]"}

The author believes that the problems in the past academic research on grass-roots anti-right movements are: First, the lack of understanding the whole process of anti-right movement in a grass-roots unit county; second, the complexity, repetition and locality of the history of grassroots anti-right movements, did not give adequate examination and analysis; III.

This paper uses the case process files of five grass-roots right-wing elements in Anyuan County as the basic data for investigation and analysis to further explore the whole process and complexity of grass-roots anti-right movements in a county from a micrological perspective, with a view to promoting grass-roots anti-right movement research. \\nI. QUESTIONS AND INFORMATION\\nThe anti-right movement is a very important research topic in the study of national history, attracting great attention from scholars. Scholars such as Narana Rayandas, Ding Shu, Lin Yunhui, Zhu Zheng, Zhang Yihe, Shen Zhihua and Xie Yong made pioneering contributions to the high-ranking decision-making process of anti-right movements and the research of famous right-wing elements. (Naranarayan Dasi/Xinwen//Tang Ming Translation: 'China's Anti-Right Movement', Huayue Literary Publishing House 1989; Ding Xu: 'Yang Mou: The End of the Anti-Right Movement', Hong Kong Open Press 2006; Ding Song: 'Reviving 'Against the Right' 50 Years Later: The Fate of Contemporary Chinese Intellectuals, Hong Kong Garden Bookhouse 2007; Lam Yunhui: Gao Gan Right: Party Civil Battlefield Against the Right (Hong Kong), Twenty-first Century, 2007 Issue 8; Zhu Zheng: 'The History of the Fight Against the Right' Sau Wei, Taiwan, 2013; Zhang Yiho, Written by 'Fifty Festivals Without Sacrifice' Starkel Publishing (Hong Kong), Ltd. 2007; Shen Zhihua: Thinking and Choosing: From Intellectuals Conference to Anti-Right Movement, Hong Kong Wen University Press 2008; Xie Young: Lin Xi-ling and the Student Right (Hong Kong), Twenty-first Century 1997 No. 4, etc. However, from the point of view of academic history, there are relatively few high-quality articles and writings on grass-roots anti-right movement research, and articles and writings of the nature of the right-wing memoirs are mostly a history of individual suffering and complaints. In recent years, some progress has also been made in research on anti-right movements, particularly at the grass-roots level. Researchers such as Wang Sirui, Professor Cao Shuji and Prof Li Ruojian made further research. Researcher Wang Si Rui reveals a historical orientation of the anti-right movement-'the active right' [Wang Sirui (Chen Zi-ming), 'Revisionists in the Active Right' [J] (Hong Kong), 'Twenty-first Century 2007 (8)]; Dr Liu Xiange believes that the re-education through labour system for the right is not early There are premeditated, but rather In response to the aftermath of the situation [Liu Xiange's Right Treatment and Re-education through Labour [J] (Hong Kong), 21st Century 2007 (8)], however, he also acknowledged that the theory 'still needs to be more deeply explored in history' [Zhang Xingxing, 'Socialism with Chinese Characteristics and the Foundation of Mao Zedong [M] Beijing Contemporary China Press 2014]; Professor Cao Shuji and Dr. Li Nan, using a county's 72 right-wing files in 1962, to study the differences of speech between 'right-wing' and the qualitative problems of 'right-wing' between 'rightists'. Methodology is quite innovative [Cao Tree Base/ Li Nan, Division of the Right: A Study Based on the Archives of Tongbai County [J] Academia 2010 (1)]. At the same time, in an unpublished article, Professor Cao analyzed the wind and anti-right in the grass-roots political district, and concluded that grass-roots anti-right anti-right is an outright 'Yang Mou' [Cao Shuji 'Yang Mou: Breeze and Anti-Right in the Grassroots Political District-centered on Tongbai County'. Reading Materials Shanghai: Center for Contemporary Chinese History, East China Normal University 2016.8]; Prof. Li Ruojian, from the perspective of sociology, analyzes the causes of the formation of 'the right of the common people' or grass-roots right-wing elements from three perspectives [J] The Sociological Interpretation of Grassroots Rights Movement [J] Open Age 2008 (4)), ]. At the same time, Professor Li Ruojian also used sociological theory to further analyze the sociological reasons why some grass-roots workers have taken advantage of becoming right-wing elements. In a broader social context, he discussed grass-roots anti-right movements [Li Ruojian's Progressive Trap-Sociological Interpretation of Grassroots Anti-Right Movement' [J] Journal of Sun Yat-sen University (Social Science Edition)] 2010 (4)] ; Professor Han Gang, focusing on the fate of a common grass-roots 'right-wing', thinks that the reason why this person is classified as 'right-wing' is not his speech in the revelation, but the censorship and treatment in the struggle.

On the basis of the above scholar's research, I used the files of five grass-roots right-wing individuals in Anyuan County in Anyuan County, using the files of five grass-roots right-wing individuals in Anyuan County in Anyuan County, Jiangxi Province, to carry out a process of combing the grassroots anti-right movement. \\nAt the same time, it should be noted that the above scholars have focused their attention on anti-right movements at the grass-roots level, which has changed the tendency of past studies to focus too much on the operation of high-level policies and the elite right, and greatly contributed to the study of the history of the anti-right movement. It is also undeniable that the research of these scholars on grass-roots anti-right movements remains problematic and inadequate. I. Lack of understanding of the whole process of grass-roots anti-right movements in a county; Second, the complexity, repetition and locality of the history of grass-roots anti-right movements are not sufficiently rational and inadequately examined and analyzed; III. On the study of the perspective and perspective, scholars on the grass-roots anti-right movement Research, mostly from the 'top' to 'down' perspective at the grass-roots level to study grassroots anti-right movements, missing from the grassroots The 'down' perspective of the right-wing elements looks at grass-roots anti-right movements; IV. Flaws in the use of data, archives and materials used by the Grassroots Anti-Right Movement Research Institute. Although there are first-hand files and process files, there are obvious shortcomings in the lack of lengthy process files and core information. \\nThis paper uses the files of five grass-roots right-wing individuals in Anyuan County. It mainly takes into account the complete and lengthy process files of the five, which also includes the core files flowing from the windy leadership group, the County United Front Department archives, local histories, local history and local party history books, etc. Reference was also made to the personal files of 30 right-wing elements and 42 right-wing corrective decisions etc. It needs to be noted that the personal files of right-wing elements used in this paper have a certain homogeneity. However, they also have their own characteristics, which reflect the process and comprehensiveness of grass-roots anti-right movements for a relatively long period of time and completeness, and deserve further study. \\nAs Scholar Xiao Donglian put it, 'To further the study of contemporary history in China, there is a great deal of micro-research, including thematic, regional and case studies. Only a large amount of empirical research can demonstrate the complexity and richness of history and bring past macro conclusions to the test.' At the same time, he also believes that ''Looking at history from the bottom' is not only to affirm the significance of the daily life history of the underprivileged people, but also provides a new perspective for observing big events' [J] 'Study of Chinese Communist Party History' 2016 (6)]. Professor Xiao said, to provide a theoretical basis for this study. From the perspective of the case of five grassroots right-wing elements in Anyuan County, this paper examines the grass-roots anti-right movement of a county, which belongs to the 'look at history from the bottom'. The whole process of grass-roots anti-right movements in counties. Such a study could further transform the perspective of anti-right movement research, from the point of view of the most grass-roots orientation, the individual right, the whole process of grass-roots anti-right movements, and in-depth analysis of grass-roots anti-right movements, which could further demonstrate the complexity, richness and extent of grass-roots anti-right movements Party specificity, providing a new perspective for observing anti-right movements, especially grass-roots anti-right movements, with a view to analyzing the grassroots The anti-right movement, the micro-logic behind this political movement. \\nIn this article, Anyuan County, located in the Yangtze River Basin, was once a red revolutionary county, and is a highly coloured county [CPC Central Party History Research Office, 'History of the Chinese Communist Party' (1921-1949), [M] CPC History Press 2015]. \\nSecond, Ou yangpu: correcting the right, not to arrange work\\n24 July 1986, morning. Anyuan County Personnel Bureau Ouyang Sheng and Comrade Chen Chuan of the United Front Department jointly talked with Ou yangpu, and told Ou yangpu again, 'its (Ou yangpu), concluded that re-education through labor is mainly due to bad elements (sodomy problem), rather than the right-wing issue, maintaining the original conclusions.' [Ou yangpu Material Cover Language, 1986-07-24. Ou yangpu file (hereinafter referred to as Ouyang file)]\\nThis historical scene will always be fixed in Ou yangpu's life. The reason for the conversation is Ou yangpu on February 3, 1986, to the CPC Jiangxi Provincial Committee United Front Department, reflecting its personal problems, 'the problem of right-wing elements has been corrected, but the work is not taken back arrangement' [the letter from Ou yangpu to the Provincial Committee United Front Department 1986-02-03 Ouyang file]. April 2, the Provincial Committee of the United Front Department of the Provincial Committee to the United Front Department of Ganzhou Land Committee, the United Front Department of the Land Committee and then transferred to Anyuan County Committee United Front Department, and instructed 'to speak to himself' ['Ou yangpu written letter and instructions' 1986-04-02 Ouyang file]. This year, Ou yangpu 58 years old, nearly the year of flowers, is still running for their own destiny. \\nOu yangpu, formerly known as Ou yangpu, alias Baigu, male, born in September 1928, Anyuan County Chengguan town, poor farmers, junior high school culture. In December 1941 from Anyuan County middle school to participate in the work until July 1949, Anyuan County Yongan Public Office as a clerk, county government employee, secretary of the County Training Institute and the security officer of the Xinshan town public office and other positions. [The main experience before and after the revolution, 'right elements review conclusion table' 1958-04-04 Ouyang file] August 20, 1949, Anyuan County was liberated, under the jurisdiction of Ganzhou sub-district [Historical History, Anyuan County People's Government website, 2019-08-04 Lookup]. According to the Central Committee on the old regime's 'big package' policy, in October, Ou yangpuvia Sun Shaofeng introduced to the first district office of Anyuan County, since then, Ou yangpu embarked on the nascent road ['the main experience before and after the revolution', 'right elements review conclusion table', 1958-04-04 Ouyang file]. In December 1949, Ren County Shanglianxiang Township Governor, in March 1953, was transferred to the principal of the county stone primary school. In 1957, in Anyuan County Shutian primary school teacher, was classified as 'general right-wing'. In 1957, during the winter vacation, Anyuan County concentrated small and medium-sized teachers in the county city, to help the party rectify the movement. Ou yangpu responded to the call of the party, very positive attitude, combining their work experience and what they saw after liberation. Ou yangpu 'sounded' many remarks, together with colleagues exposing the usual remarks, was later summarized as six 'poisons' by the windy leadership group: ① negates the enthusiasm of the masses to go cooperative. Ou yangpu said, 'Cooperation is not from the people's voluntary, but the party uses rhetoric to seduce them'; ② distorts the party's cadre policy and personnel system. He said, 'The party's promotion of cadres is heavy de and light, and credit for the party and members of the group, and it simply looks down on non-party personnel.' 'The handling of party members of the party is too light, and party members have an additional layer of firewalls'; ③ oppose the general purchase and sales policy of grain. Ou yangpu believes that '(sales policy), sell surplus food is forced to sell, sell and buy it back, this is labor and wounding money'; = 4\\\\ * GB3 ④ is unhappy with reality. Ou yangpu in 1956-1957, often instilled the idea of colleagues, 'the problem of marriage now is the world of superior cadres rich and powerful people', 'now there is money to have the world', 'now is also a horse fart people have a future'; = 5\\\\ * GB3 ⑤ intentionally bend the fact, bending party rectification small Learn policy. Ouyangpu said, 'The county committee has all led people to bet, and the highest organ of the county committee should promote gambling. I fear what will I bet more in the future than the KMT,' 'the first step is to rectify the primary school, the second step is to run, step three kneeling'; = 6\\\\ * GB3 ⑥ opposition leader. The colleague revealed that in October 1956, his statement at Shuda Elementary School said, 'Five Star Social Party Branch has no capacity to educate us, we are managed by the Cultural and Education Bureau, you can't care about us.' [Reactionary Speech,' Right Facts Review Conclusion Form, 1958-04-04; 'Corrective Opinions on Comrade Ou yangpu's Misdesignation as Rightists', 1979-03-30. Ouyang files] the whole wind movement, from the 'slightest' stage to the anti-right struggle, Ou yangpu expressed great sympathy to Tang Pei Ju, already classified as a right-wing element. At the same time, his heart also has hidden unrest, afraid of being beaten as right-wing elements. As a result, in the end, the anti-right struggle really came to themselves, and Ou yangpu was classified as a right-wing element. Ou yangpu has taken an attitude of refusing to recognize the remarks of his colleagues and the 'poison grass' that has just 'sounded'. After several struggles, Ou yangpu surrendered to the Party and honestly addressed questions. ['Right Factor Review Conclusion Form', 1958-04-04 Ouyang file] In February 1958, Ou yangpu was established as 'general right', the punishment opinion is 'dismissal (public), re-education through labor', Ou yangpu on February 19, in my opinion column on the conclusion, signed 'Agree' [Conclusions and Processing Opinions after the Review of the Unit', 'Right Factor Review Conclusion Form' 1958-04-04 Ouyang file]. However, when the 'right-wing elements review conclusion form' was transferred to the Anyuan County Committee's leadership group, on March 8, they signed an opinion that 'abolished their original duties and supervise labor'. On March 25, the agreement was presented to the LCC leadership group to sign an 'downgrade salary reduction', April 14. Anyuan County Committee rectification Office, in the remarks column signed the opinion is 'salary from 7, down to 10' [Conclusions and Handling Opinions after the Review of the Unit, 1958-04-04; 'Conclusions on Ouyangpu' (no time), Ouyang file]. From the comments made during the presentation of the above-mentioned 'Right Party Review Conclusion Form', the penalties for Ouyangpu are getting lighter, but at this time the political movement is undercurrent. In April, Anyuan County Cultural and Education Bureau reported the case of Ouyangpu to the County Procuratorate, due to: Sodomy and the relationship between men and women. Three times in 1947 and one in 1951, at the same time, there were three issues of relations between men and women prior to liberation; secondly, the issue of right-wing elements. The former is the primary cause, and the latter is a secondary cause. [List of Conclusions on Ou yangpu (no time), Ouyang file] This is the deadly inflection point in the history of Ouyangpu's fate, and later, the focus of the debate was decided here. On April 27, the County Procuratorate approved the letter to the Cultural and Education Bureau, 'to pursue criminal responsibility of Ouyangpu, suggest sending re-education through labour', the Cultural and Education Bureau reported to the County Committee leading group, on May 7, issued the 'Disciplinary Approval on the Expulsion of Bad Molecules Ouyangpu' ['List of Conclusions on the Treatment of Ou yangpu' (no time); 'On Ou yangpu's misdesignation of the right Correction Decision 1979-04-22 Ouyang file], and at this time Ou yangpu, but completely unknown, still in the original unit Shutian primary school carrying 'keep public office, remain in teaching' ['On Ou yangpu mistaken as rightists' 1979-04-22; 'Ou yangpu wrote to the superior Letter 1978-06-24. Ouyang file] the disposal and work. \\nJune 25, 1958, was an unforgettable day of Ou yangpu's life. Although, 20 years later, when in 1978, the book reflected his problems, Ou yangpu still remembered very accurately. Staff member of the Education Bureau Ho Fuk Chuen (at that time redeployed to the Office of the Wind), went to Shutian Primary School to convey the notice of the Office, 'Expulsion from public office, send Ou yangpu to re-education through labour' ['Conclusions on Ou yangpu' (no time), Ouyang files]. \\nHe Fuquan personally sent Ou yangpu to a labor farm car. The degree of punishment of the right-wing elements in Ou yangpu, why in a short period of time, such a big change occurred. On March 25, 1958, the land committee's disposition was 'downgraded salary reduction', and on May 7, the County People's Committee decided to 'dismiss public office, send re-education through labour', to be implemented until June 25. The main reason is that the Cultural and Education Bureau referred the case of Ouyangpu to the County Procuratorate, and the county procurator's office then reported the case to the county leadership group. On May 7, the county people referred to 'sodomy and messing up gender relations' ['Corrective Decision on Misdesignation of Rightists in Ouyangpu' 1979-04-22 Ouyang file] come Processing. On July 2, Ou yangpu arrived at the Furong Farm in Jiujiang, Jiangxi Province, which was founded by the Jiangxi Provincial Public Security Department. [List of conclusions on the treatment of Ou yangpu problem' (no time), Ouyang files; 'Furong Farm', 'Pengze County Government Website' 2019-08-07 View] The name of the Furong farm, it is easy to recall the famous director Xie Jin's film 'Furong Town', in fact, to the right of the Furong farm Molecular Fate 'Hibiscus Town' is the same as the characters. Chen Qinglian, professor of the Department of Economics and Management at Fudan University, was mistaken as the right in 1959, dismissed from public office and sent to the Furong farm. Ou yangpu, who was a year earlier than Professor Chen Qinglian, may have had the privilege to recognize the university professor, but the fate of the post-labor reform was quite different. [Chen Qinglian 'Spring of 1978, book Deng Xiaoping stated his life and aspirations. Deng Xiaoping told in his letter: 'So there is no big mistake, please Jiangxi Provincial Committee for him Arrange the work'. Soon, Jiangxi Province appointed a person to interview him on the farm, coinciding with Chen Qinglian studying Deng Xiaoping's speech at the National Conference on Science and Technology, and he did an English translation on the spot. In October of the same year, Chen Qinglian first moved away from the farm in other 'hat-picking' right, to the English Department of Jiujiang Normal College. In the summer of 1980, he was transferred to the Department of Economics and Management, Fudan University, Shanghai. In 1985, he was promoted to professor and received special allowance for senior intellectuals under the State Council.' Baidu Chen Qinglian information, November 1, 2019 access]. \\nOu yangpubi, a professor at Fudan University, fortunately, in December 1959, transferred to Dongxiang County iron and steel factory cement workshop to continue re-education through labor. In July 1962, he was announced to take off the right-wing hat, and relieved re-education through labour into workers, and enjoy public medical treatment. [The letter from the Department of Anyuan County Committee to the Provincial Correction through Labour Administration Department 1982-07-15; 'Ou yangpu's Letter to the Secretary of the County Committee' 1981-10-13 Ouyang file]\\nWith the adjustment of the national industrial and agricultural policy, under the call of 'big agriculture'. In 1963, the steel factory was suspended, Ou yangpu returned to Anyuan County, mainly to sell hard force, to feed a family of 6 people. During the 'Cultural Revolution', the right-wing identity of Ouyangpu once again brought suffering to it, repeatedly stumbled, displayed and travelled the streets, suffered all kinds of humiliation, and the family's property was also expropriated by the Anyuan County Hospital in Anyuan County, giving only a small amount of compensation. At the same time, the Red Guard also carried out a copy of his home to Ouyangpu. In 1968, Ou yangpu family was forced to devolve to Anyuan County Chatou commune talented brigade rural, 1975, as a private teacher of the brigade primary school ['Ou yangpu to the United Front Committee Department letter 1986-02-03; Chatou commune talented brigade to the County Committee Organization Department letter 1978-06-17 Ouyang file]. \\nOn May 19, 1978, Anyuan County Chatou commune Party Committee, according to the April 5, 1978 'Report on the Removal of All Rightists' took off Ou yangpu's right-wing hat [Decision on the removal of the right hat 1978-05-19 Ouyang file]. After the commune party committee took off Ou yangpu's right-wing hat, Ou yangpu timely Shangshu County Committee responsible comrade, in addition to expressing gratitude to the party, hope their problems can be solved as soon as possible, resume work, serve the four modernization construction ['Ou yangpu to the county committee responsible for comrade report' 1978-06-10 Ouyang Files]. At the same time, given that Ou yangpu was a private teacher, the teaching achievements were remarkable, received praise from local leaders and the masses, so that the party branch of the Talent Brigade and the Management Committee jointly wrote to the organization department of the county committee, expressing the desire to keep Ou yangpu in the talented brigade as an official teacher. [Letter from Chantau Commune Talent Brigade to the County Committee Organization Department 1978-06-17 Ouyang file] But reality is cruel to Ou yangpu. \\nOn March 30, 1979, Anyuan County Cultural and Education Bureau decided that the right elements of Ou yangpu were mistaken and corrected. However, Ou yangpu will not be withdrawn from work due to sexual relations and sodomy, bringing bad elements and being upheld by the decision of 'dismissal from public office, re-education through labour'. Perhaps, the above-mentioned decision of the Education and Education Bureau has not yet killed Ou yangpu's fate, because this is a petition report from the County Cultural and Education Bureau, and the final opinion will also require the county committee review leadership group to decide. [Correction Opinion on Comrade Ou yangpu was mistaken as right-wing elements' 1979-03-30 Ouyang file]\\nTwenty days later, Ou yangpu ushered in a fatal decision. The county committee review lead group upheld the 'Disposition Approval for Expulsion of Bad Molecule Ouyangpu' on May 7, 1958, and will not withdraw the arrangement work. [On Comrade Ou yangpu's Correction Decision 1979-04-22 Ouyang Files] This decision, let Ou yangpu embark on the road of 'petition' for many years in order to solve their problems. \\nIn the 1980s, in the history of the Republic, it was an era of chaos. Ou yangpu also looks forward to a complete solution to their problems. In 1980, the whole family was retaken back to the city of Anyuan County, and returned to life in Anyuan County, Ou yangpu and his family, still struggled to sustain their livelihood. Because of family life difficulties, the eldest son was studying to high, dropping out of school, the elder daughter did part-time work in powder dry factory, old three and old four in primary school, old three also took the photo gallery Pick water subsidies to buy school supplies, Ou yangpu's lover, do nanny work. Ou yangpu, in addition to selling hard force and maintaining household use, also focused on solving his own problems, he also knows the crux of his problem. \\nOn August 30, 1979, wrote to the Anyuan County People's Court requesting a review of its 1958 'Reeducation through Labour' judgment and reasons [the letter from Ou yangpu to the County People's Court 1979-08-30 Ouyang file]. The County People's Court on September 26, forwarded the letter and reply to the County Review Office, recommending that 'after processing the results of the process can directly reply to the letter to the letter' ['County People's Court Letter Transfer Form 1979-09-26 Ouyang file], the County People's Court kicked the ball back to the review and reform office. Ou yangpu is not satisfied, again wrote a letter of complaint to the County People's Court, requesting a review of its issues. The court formally replied, '(Ou yangpu), sent re-education through labour without a judgme"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "nt from our hospital, so it is not within the scope of review by our hospital.' At the same time, the court recommended that 'contact with the relevant departments for processing'. [Reply to the County People's Court 1981-07-28 Ouyang file] After the way of the Shouxian People's Court to review the judgment and reason was blocked, Ou yangpu turned to the county committee leaders (Ouyang Secretary), and they used the language extremely humble, saying that the county committee leader was the 'head' and requested the supervision of the host department to review, and suggest the host Department to provincial reform administration or Dongxiang County iron and steel factory review [Ou yangpu to the secretary report 1981-10-13 Ouyang file]. \\nOu yangpu has a multi-pronged approach, Paoxian's United Front Department, the Revision Office and the Cultural and Education Bureau have received almost all the same answers. The reason for re-education through labour is not the problem of right-wing elements, but bad elements, and also on sodomy and relations between men and women. Ou yangpu also visited Ouyang secretary of the CPC County Committee many times, and even met Ouyang secretary, who expressed his claim in person, and on the other several occasions he was not able to see Secretary Ouyang. After the failure of the county party party leader, unwilling Ou yangpu, wrote a letter to the secretary Ouyang, 'request to organize a procedure, by yourself directly to the provincial reform administration or Dongxiang County iron and steel factory to review the reasons for re-education through labor', this letter, was instructed by the Secretary Ouyang to go to the County United Front Department, and asked for reply to Ou yangpuBen People. [Letter from Ou yangpu to the Secretary of Europe 1982-07-6 Ouyang file]\\nThe instructions of Secretary Ouyang played a role. The United Front Work Department of Anyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China wrote to the provincial reform administration, requesting the assistance of the Bureau to find Ou yangpu's re-education through labour notice form. The Provincial Labour Administration instructed that letters from the United Front Work Department of Anyuan County Committee of the CCP be transferred to the Dongxiang County Iron and Steel Plant, asking the factory to help find Ou yangpu's materials, and reply to the United Front Department of Anyuan County Committee. [The letter from the County Committee United Front Department to the Provincial Bureau of Labour Reform 1982-07-15 Ouyang file]\\nDongxiang County Iron and Steel Factory, after several days of searching, replied to the United Front Work Department of the Anyuan County Committee of the CPC, 'all of the relevant personnel in the past years have no record of this person.' [Dongxiang copper mine (formerly known as Dongxiang County Iron and Steel Plant), to the County Committee United Front Department of 1982-07-31 Ouyang file] So far, Ou yangpu's case went to a dead end. Ouyangpu is very disappointed, in front of lovers and children, also unable to lift his head and forced to live under pressure, Ou yangpu slowed the pace of seeking solutions to their problems. In 1982, Ou yangpu has been 5 and 4 years old, after the destiny year, a family of 6 people, needs him to feed, only fight the old life to maintain a family life, life pressure, almost to overwhelm Ou yangpu. At the same time, because of family hardship, a son is deaf due to illness, aggravating the already suffering family. \\nIn 1986, Ouyangpu was 58 years old, and there were two years away from the retirement of regular State staff. Ouyangpu may realize that the time left for itself is running short, and Ouyangpu has accelerated the pace of 'petition' to solve their problems. On February 3, Ou yangpu, using photocopy paper wrote two letters with the exact same content, one sent to the CPC Ganzhou Land Committee United Front Department; another sent to the CPC Jiangxi Provincial Committee United Front Department. From the content of the letter, it can be seen that in these years, Ou yangpu has on the surface slowed the pace of seeking solutions to their problems, in fact, in the dark, never gave up efforts. Looking for County Public Security Bureau instructor Zhu Yucan, Zhu also facing the leading team leader of the county hat picking office Huang Guimao, testified that '(Ou yangpu), is not bad, nor has he ever crossed the bad elements'; even found the premier Sun biography, Sun County Governor instructed the County United Front Department, 'his (Ou yangpu), bad elements are not qualitative In terms of disciplinary action, today he lifted re-education through labor is not considered.' At the same time, he also listed six pieces of evidence. Comrade He Fuquan, who personally sent him to re-education through labor, was also asked to help prove that many times he actively reflected Ou yangpu's problems to the organization. [Letter from Ou yangpu to the United Front Department of the Land Commission, 'Ou yangpu's Letter to the Provincial Committee United Front Department' 1986-02-03 Ouyang file]\\nThese two letters finally returned to the United Front Department of the Anyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China. The United Front Department of the CPC County Committee still died and seized Ou yangpu's 'bad elements', and insisted on the original conclusions. No road cast Ou yangpu, not dead, also called dead horse as a horse doctor. Ou yangpu turned to an unseen distant friend Ouyang Bangdong (now known as Ouyang Lake), Ouyang Lake, 1950, went to Shenyang as a soldier, 1955, went to the Shenyang Military Region to work, 1986, in the Shenyang Military Region dry resting (this person should have a certain position). From the contents of the letter, Ou yangpu and Ouyang Lake are extremely unfamiliar. In order to deepen the impression of Ouyang Lake on their own, Ouyangpu even lifted his grandfather out and introduced it. At the end of the letter, the signature is Ouyangpu's milk name 'Bago'. [The letter from Ou yangpu to Ouyang Bangdong 1986-04-19 Ouyang] Ouyang Lake received Ou yangpu's letter, in a dilemma, helpless. Ouyang Lake, despite having a certain military rank, left home for many years, hometown people are not familiar with this fellow. Ouyang Lake, wrote a letter to the United Front Department of Anyuan County Committee and said, 'I can not deal with it according to the rules, just go to the letter, do the interpretation work according to the relevant policies... if it feels wrong'. [Letter from Ouyang Lake to Anyuan County Committee United Front Department 1986-05-05 Ouyang file] Ouyang Lake means euphemingly telling the CPC Anyuan County Committee United Front Department, in accordance with the policy. \\nOu yangpu is still not dead, and continues to write to the CPC Lands Commission United Front Work Department. The contents of its letter are basically the same as February 3. [Letter from Ouyang Lake to the United Front Department of the Land Commission, 1986-05-17 Ouyang file] The Communist Party of the Communist Party of China's Lands Commission United Front Department, also transferred the letter to the United Front Department of Anyuan County Committee of the CPC, as well as Shen Sea, silent. Later, the government did not forget Ouyangpu, and his life also took care of it. In 1987, in 1987, the name of Ouyangpu appeared on the list of grants paid to people living in difficulties after the correction by right-wing elements. The grant amount is 50 yuan, the highest of 20 people, 20 people receiving the subsidy cost list, 9 including Europe Yangpu, no salary level, 8 people have gone, live in the list, only Ou yangpu a no Wage level, indicating that only Ou yangpu one person may not resume work, in the subsidy reason column states 'I am sick and have a deaf and mute, living in poverty'. From Ouyangpu's signature handwriting, there is also no spirit in the book. [The Register of Subsidy Fees for Persons in Difficulty Living Difficulties after Mistaking Right Correction, Anyuan County Committee United Front Department reported to the province, the Lands Commission United Front Department Digital Report 1987-01-7-11-26 Ouyang file]\\nLater in Ou yangpu, life did enter a difficult period, home again moved back to the countryside to live, relying on tofu for a living. In 1987, Ou yangpu, the year of the flower, again wrote to the CPC Ganzhou Lands Committee, and also attached the reply of himself to the provincial reform administration and the Dongxiang County Iron and Steel Factory, as well as a certificate from Chen Luosheng, a right-wing activist who worked with Ou yangpu. This letter is also shining the sea. The staff member, at the end of the letter, wrote in a pencil the following words, '1988.5.4, Coming in the morning'. [Letter from Ouyang Lake to the United Front Work Department of the Land Commission 1987-12-29 Ouyang file]\\nFrom then on, a 60-year-old flower, disappeared in the file. \\nThird, Liu Wenkui: draw the right first, but the conclusion is a historical counter-revolution\\nYe Xiaoqing (Secretary of Anyuan County Committee's Hat Picking Office), asked: Liu Wenkui, 'Do you know your decision to punish?' I (Liu Wenkui), told Ye Xiaoqing about the situation at that time. Ye said, 'Your decision to dispose of this is a historical counter-revolution, expelled from work home.' 'I (Liu Wenkui), feel strange! I am the right.' \\nOn the day of May 1978, this was a conversation between Liu Wenkui and Ye Xiaoqing, secretary of the Anyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China's Anyuan County Committee, deeply imprinted in Liu Wenkui's mind. From May 1958 to May 1978, for 20 years, Liu Wenkui essentially followed the 'historical counter-revolution', and he always thought he was a right-wing, 'I am the right.' [Liu Wenkui Letter of Complaint 1979-03-15 Liu Wenkui File (Liu Dang)]\\nLiu Wenkui, male, born in 1930, family origin landlord and industry, high school culture, Anyuan County Chatou commune, that is, Ou yangpu was later sent out of rural commune in the commune. In September 1949, participated in the work, has served as Anyuan County Committee team member, County Public Security Bureau officer, grassroots supply and marketing community administrator. [The Right Factor Review Conclusion Table 1958-05-29; 'On Liu Wenkui's Mistaking as the Right Factor Problem Correction Decision' 1979-04-26 Liu Dang] 1957, in Anyuan County, the stoning supply and marketing company was the city administrator, the wind movement 'liberated', released a lot of 'poisons', combined with its history, Captain of the Sanqing Brigade, classified as 'general right', May 1958, finalized. Liu Wenkui 'Ming release' out of the 'poisonous grass', mainly include: ① malicious attack grain purchase and sale. In June 1957, at the study meeting, Liu Wenkui said, 'To properly deal with internal conflicts within the people, we need to abolish the general purchase and sale of food, which is the scourge of creating internal contradictions among the people. Farmers cannot eat enough, pork and cotton cloth have been limited to death. Do farmers have no opinion yet?' ② The leader of the opposition party agrees with the 'party world' view of the 'party world'. Liu Wenkui said, 'Chu Anping is really bold, very right. The heads of our county-sized units are party members'; ③ listen to Taiwan's enemy Taiwan selling countries. Liu Wenkui often listens to Taiwanese broadcasts, and says, 'Taiwanese broadcasting is particularly good'; = 4\\\\ * GB3 ④ attempts to divide the socialist camp. In June 1957, when the Marinkov opposition group of the Soviet Union was revealed, Liu Wenkui said, 'There must be problems with the system of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union' [Right Facts Review Conclusion Form 1958-05-29; 'Corrective Opinions on Comrade Liu Wenkui's Misdesignation as Rightists' 1979-03-20 Liu Dang]. \\nLiu Wenkui raised only one point of doubt about the above remarks when correcting, namely, 'not listening to Taiwan broadcasts regularly, but not looking for a station in time.' The rest of the remarks admit that they said ['Corrective Opinions on Comrade Liu Wenkui's misdesignation as right-wing elements' (Opinion signed by Liu Wenkui), 1977, 9-03-20 Liu Dang]  Liu Wenkui's remarks of 'poisonous grass' that were sorted out during the whole wind movement were frequently made during the period between June and July 1957. Every statement is accompanied by a witness. After Liu Wenkui was classified as a right-wing, Liu Wenkui attempted to resist, deal with problems, take a toothpaste approach, admit little by little, not to deal with it, especially after every statement found a witness, Liu Wenkui's attitude gradually and honestly Up ['the right elements of the review conclusion table' 1958-05-29 [Liu files]. \\nOn May 24, 1958, Anyuan County Heavy Stone District Committee's disposition is 'classified as general right-wing elements, expelling their ranks, expelling all posts, leaving local society to supervise labor'; Liu Wenkui signed and stamped, 'fully agree, is determined to transform themselves from labor and re-become people'; the report was handed over to the county committee. After the guide group, the whole wind office signed the opinion is, 'to pay the group of five 'Disposal'; May 29, the final treatment of the county team of five was 'expulsion from home'. [The Right Elements Review Conclusion Form 1958-05-29 Liu Dang]\\nAfter Liu Wenkui was classified as a 'general right', the organization planned to send Liu Wenkui to the Gaoyunshan reclamation farm in Anyuan County just established in December 1957. Liu Wenkui begged organizations, if they do not keep their jobs, let themselves go home and produce labor. Because, Liu Wenkui's lover Lai Yurong was implicated in returning home, with three more children. The county community subsidized Liu Wenkui's salary for one month, and Liu Wenkui returned to her home in Chengguan town. In the face of difficult circumstances, Liu Wenkui asked the Anyuan County Committee for proper job placement and a way out of life. Liu Wenkui was assigned by the County Labor Bureau to the county handling station. The main job is to pull the car hard and work on the culture and education of the workers in the station. \\nFortunately, Liu Wenkui and his family lived through a difficult period of three years. In 1961, when the state made adjustments to the national economy, he put forward a call for 'large agricultural and large food'. Liu Wenkui was delegated back to Chengguan town, and the Town People's Committee assigned it to the handling station to continue handling work. In 1969, in the third year of the 'Cultural Revolution', Liu Wenkui family was delegated to Chatou commune leading brigade settled. The whole family, except Liu Wenkui, received the installation fee. During the 10 years in rural areas, Liu Wenkui was still quite safe in his labor. He did not violate government policies and decrees. However, he saw the 'gangs of four' overrule, wandering on the issue of the hats of the right, and thought pressure was heavy.

Teachers of primary and secondary schools in the county on winter holidays focused on the scene to conduct a 'sweeping conference'. At first, Chen Zhuohua was silent, and some opinions were reluctant to mention. It may be to see some headings and want to get mixed, especially when the whole wind movement moves into anti-right struggles, there are more thoughtful thoughts and heavy and depleted will. Even less dare to fight against right-wing elements. After the leadership has repeatedly mobilized, Chen Zhuohua, as the school principal, is afraid to be considered 'backward' and eventually be 'Yang Mou' fishing ashore, ['right-wing examination conclusion table' 1958-03-08 Chen file] 'sounded' many suggestions. In the fight against the right, Chen was identified as 'ordinary right-wing,' a charge that affected Chen Zhuohua's 'family lost'. Chen Zhuohua is classified as 'ordinary right-wing' for two main reasons: one, historical issues. Chen Zhuohua participated in the Inspirational Society and Chen Xi Inspirational Association ['Right Factor Review Conclusion Form' 1958-03-08 Chen file], Inspirational Society formerly known as Whampoa Society Inspirational Society, founded on January 1, 1929, it is Chiang Kai-shek imitation of the Japanese army of the 'industry' organization founded, for Chiang Kai-shek, Song Mineisho Relying on [Guan Lin 'Inspirational Society' [J] Zhongshan Wind and Rain 2004 (4)].

Chen and his family are emotionally difficult to accept. Usually, do not dare to vent out, seize the opportunity of 'sweeping', saying a few words, unfortunately classified as 'right-wing elements'. Faced with many struggles and people testified to the fact that Chen Zhuohua gradually took his views, from the beginning of the denial, to the basic acknowledgement and plea of his guilt, and honest account of his crimes. In order to make Chen Zhuohua's 'right-wing' characterization, on February 5, the county committee leadership group issued a more detailed 'single-line material' to refine the speech and performance of Chen Zhuohua's daily life and work, specific to the time and place. [Single line material on delineating Chen Zhuo Huawei's right-wing elements' 1958-02-05] At this point, Chen Zhuohua has only accepted and consented to the opinion of the organization. 'classified as ordinary right-wing elements. In accordance with his reactionary circumstances and its attitude in the fight against the right and the consistent performance of the right, our opinion has given Chen Zhuohua to remove all his existing posts and submit supervision of labor at the workplace' and 'to allocate less paid jobs, with wages reduced from grade 7 to 10'. [Right Factor Review Conclusion Form 1958-03-08 Chen Dang] County People's Association approved the aforesaid conclusions of the bride office on April 15. [Anyuan County People's Committee on the sanction of Chen Zhuohua by right-wing elements 1958-04-15 Chen file]\\nChen Zhuohua, 30 years old, has since become a 'marginalized person' falling into society. Prior to June 1958, Chen Zhuohua was able to continue to stay in school, the principal was removed from his position, and the salary was reduced from the original 7 level 37 yuan to level 10 26 yuan. Wives and children depend mainly on Chen Zhuohua's wages and agricultural income, and his father Chen Faqu is still serving his sentence in prison. [Investigation Report on Chen Zhuohua, a deceased person who has taken off the right caps, 1978-10. Chen Dang] In July 1958, the summer vacation began, Chen Zhuohua lost his teacher post, [the 'cap-picked personnel questionnaire' (no time), Chen organized a decision, Chen Zhuohua sent home to participate in agricultural production, and cancel wages. [Investigation Report on Chen Zhuohua, a deceased person who has taken off the right caps, 1978-10. Chen Zhuohua after returning home, with his wife, engaged in agricultural production and feeding the family. Unfortunately, the fate of the 'Great Leap Forward' madness began, and the ensuing 'Great Famine' devoured the lives of Chen Zhuohua's mother and his wife and children together with four. [In the Conclusion Form of Rightists Examination, Chen contains three family members, father, mother, wife and child. Right Factor Review Conclusion Form 1958-03-08. However, in 1978, when the survey was corrected, the questionnaire had shown that Chen Zhuohua had only one father among his family members. 'Investigation Report on Chen Zhuohua, a deceased person who has taken off the right hat', 1978-10, Chen Zhuohua was the labor force of just 32 years old at the time of the Holodomor in 1960. If, in normal years, alone, enough to feed the family, the political symbol of the 'right-wing' causes him to be shamed and tortured, and his own life is difficult.  Fortunately, the father is still serving his sentence in prison and, in any event, there is a basic guarantee of life. \\nAlthough, on December 30, 1961, the superior announced the removal of Chen Zhuohua's 'right-wing' hat, [the investigation report on the deceased person Chen Zhuohua, 1978-10 Chen file] Chen Zhuohua's fate did not follow  And change, take off the hat, but also the 'right-wing', is the 'right-wing' who took off the hat. \\nIn 1978, the country's political life entered the stage of 'spurring and anyway', and the corrective work of right-wing elements has also entered into the daily arrangements of party committees and governments at all levels. Anyuan County Committee set up 'Hats off the right' to carry out the work of right-wing elements. On the basis of the preliminary investigation [the report on Chen Zhuohua's report on the death of a right-wing cap-beaned person Chen Zhuohua, 1978-10], the branch committee of the Anyuan County Bureau of Culture and Education made a correction to Chen Zhuohua's misdesignation as right-wing, 'Chen Zhuohua has an error, but should not be classified as a right-wing. After the discussion at the expanded meeting of the branch branch of the Bureau decided to correct it, revoke the original sanction and restore political honor.' [Report on the Investigation Report on Chen Zhuohua, a deceased person in the right caps, 1978-10] However, in the upper left corner of the Correction Opinion, there are four words 'not to be corrected'. [Correction Opinion Concerning Chen Zhuohua's Misdesignation as Rightists 1979-04-28. 'Correction Opinions' covered with the stamp of the party branch of the Cultural and Education Bureau, not the top 4 non-official text role. In fact, even if the Corrective Opinion works, it is no longer meaningful, because Chen Zhuohua, died of illness in October 1966, [Jiangtou Commune Certificate 1978-08-25. [Chen file] was only 38 years old, just strong. At the same time, in the Correction Opinion, the Education and Education Bureau clearly stated that 'the family shall be compensated as a result of the deceased (Chen)'. [Correction Opinion Concerning Chen Zhuohua's Misdesignation as Rightists 1979-04-28] However, in October 1978, in the Investigation Report of the Office of the Working Office to Remove the Right Hats, 'In accordance with the spirit of the state policy, Chen Zhuohua was retained in public office, The father is a landlord, other no immediate family member, and we believe that we do not receive any benefit. [Investigation Report on Chen Zhuohua, a deceased person in the right caps, 1978-10 stalls] The most poor person, Chen Zhuohua's father, was released from prison in December 1967. When his father Chen Facheng returned home, his son Chen Zhuohua, also in 1966 He died in October, and the father and son did not see the last side. [Investigation Report on Chen Zhuohua, a deceased person who had taken off the right hat, 1978-10 Chen file] Since then, a 63-year-old man lived alone and had promised to give his son's burial grant, was also erased in the investigation report with a red pen. [Investigation Report on Chen Zhuohua, a deceased person who has taken off the right caps, 1978-10 file]\\n'Do not correct' four ordinary Chinese characters are the basic conclusion of Chen Zhuohua. In 1979, Chen died for 13 years. Chen died in 1966, perhaps a 'good thing'. Otherwise, the next 10 years of crazy 'Cultural Revolution', Chen Zhuohua, as a right-wing element, must also be subjected to all kinds of humiliation and unfair treatment. On July 27, 1979, the review leading group of Anyuan County Committee issued the 'Review Conclusion on Chen Zhuohua's classification as right-wing elements', 'Chen Zhuohua's remarks during the all-wind anti-right struggle in 57 years were rightists, and now upheld the conclusions of the original right, and should not be corrected'. [Conclusions on the Review of Chen Zhuohua as a right-wing element, 1979-07-27. Chen file] turned the original informal conclusion into a lead word with red stamped conclusions, once again pushing Chen Zhuohua underground into a political desperate situation. Perhaps, the soul of Chen Zhuohua is that 'from October 1, 1979, the pension according to the relevant provisions of the State', [Conclusions of the Review of Chen Zhuohua as a right-wing, 1979-07-27 file] This will have a limited subsidy effect on the life of an old father, who is already 65 years old. It is the end of Chen Zhuo Huawei's father in the midst of the hell. \\nWheels of historical progress, after all, can't be blocked. A year later, the same county committee review and reform leadership team made a 'Correction Decision on Chen Zhuohua's misdesignation as right-wing elements'. This document is the last document on Chen Zhuohua's connection with the world, compared to that one year ago. There are two differences: First, in the Correction Decision, an additional word 'wrong' appears before the word 'delineation', that is, 'misdrawing' rather than 'delineation' in the Review Conclusions; second, the last word of the document is 'correction decision'. This is also Chen Zhuohua, the last point of connection with the real world. Since then he only exists as a symbolic life in his own archives, and, from his official archives, it was destined to be destroyed in the folk archives. \\nVII. Concluding remarks\\nThe anti-right movement, one of the most significant historical events in China in the twentieth century, involved a huge number of people and families, with extremely serious consequences, and even changed China's development. Although, some scholars argue that the majority of those classified as right-wing elements (mainly grass-roots rightists), 'are only the martyrs of the political movement and cannot determine the fundamental nature of the incident' [J] (Hong Kong), 'The Historical Positioning of the Fight against the Right' [J] (Hong Kong), 'Twenty-first Century 1993 (6)]. However, it is not enough to understand the complexity, richness and local specificity of the history of anti-right movements, not from the perspective of the majority of individual right-wing elements, especially grass-roots anti-right movements. The right-wing elements of the grass-roots anti-right movement, unlike high-ranking right-wing elements, put forward their own political views [Zhang Yi and the People's Literature Press 2004]. Most of them have nothing to do with political opinions, mostly caused by contradictory relations in work, personnel and life. In particular, they work and live at the grass-roots level, often contact or see the real life of the people at the bottom of society. They can feel more deeply the changes in society, 'Spring River Plumbing and Duck Prophet'. At the same time, grass-roots right-wing elements are mostly small and medium intellectuals. They have inherited the integrity of traditional intellectuals and care The development of the country, attention to the reality, expressed great enthusiasm for the political movements and daily life of the country since the founding of the country Concerned, the leaders who preside over grass-roots anti-right movements have taken advantage of the inertia of the political movement's development, taking advantage of the normal work or the contradictions in everyday life and taking advantage of the opportunity to revenge and classify the believers into the political cold house. In this paper, five grass-roots right-wing files of Ouyangpu, Liu Wenkui, Luo Degen, Ouyang Xiang and Chen Zhuohua are selected to comb up grass-roots anti-right movements in a county, which can compensate for the problems and shortcomings of past scholars in studying grass-roots anti-right movements. From the files of five grass-roots right-wing elements in Anyuan County, it can be seen that: First, grass-roots anti-right movements are more complex and arbitrary than we think. They are also more complex than the upper and urban anti-right movements. It is difficult to comb the grassroots anti-right movements clearly. The grass-roots anti-right movement, most of them classified as right-wing elements have nothing to do with politics, are normal work or life Provoked by contradictions, those who presided over anti-right movements using the political background to achieve the results of revenge. This is also the basic logic of political movements since the founding of the nation. They are 'right and no' [Sun Yujie 'Right and No: 'Qualitative' and 'factional' in grass-roots anti-right movement-in Boxian, Anhui Province, against the right Sports Archives and Oral Materials as an Example [J] (USA), Contemporary China Study 2018 (1)]; III. Grassroots anti-right movement, with local specificity, attempts to unify the description of grass-roots anti-right movements are futile; fourthly, grass-roots anti-right movements, divided into rightists, the path of correction in the new era, difficult and capricious; five, grass-roots anti-right movements delineated The majority of the right-wing elements are ill-fated, and political stigmatization is even more serious. \\nDr. Huang Wenzhi, by analyzing the portraits and quotes of sabotage leaders during the Cultural Revolution period, broadened the interpretation of stigmatization. It also applies to right-wing elements, especially grass-roots right-wing elements. This political stigmatization has brought them even more harm, almost throughout the life of the right-wing, even the right second and third generation. Let the right and his family Sven sweep the ground and have no place for themselves, and it is difficult to head up in front of the people. Most wives are separated and even killed in correctional places. As Dr. Huang put it, 'The main function of (political stigmatization), is to delimit, segregate, and thus differentiate the actors from the ordinary population, thus showing the sense of discipline politically, so that the stigmatized people are isolated among the social groups, and thus subjugated by power and other social populations 'Discrimination, Criticism' [Huang Wenzhi's Portrait and Quotations: Based on Research and Analysis of Xie, Wan, Zheng and Huang Archives [J] China Rural Studies 16 \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\). The grass-roots right-wing elements, Ouyang Xiang, during the 'Cultural Revolution' in 1970, under the extreme left route of the 'Gang of Four', were really unbearable, and killed suicide on the hangs. Chen Zhuohua's mother, wife and children died prematurely, all directly after the political stigmatization brought by them after they were classified as rightists Fruit. The consequences of such political stigmatization are even greater than the stigmatization of the period of the Cultural Revolution. Dr. Meng Qiangwei also describes the tragic experiences of grass-roots right-wing elements during the Cultural Revolution period [Meng Qiangwei: A Preliminary Study on Right Hats Picking in Yidu County, Hubei Province (1959-1964), [J] (Hong Kong), 21st Century 2017 (12)]. For grassroots anti-right movement to be further carried out, it must be examined and analyzed for a long period of time. 'Because the deep structure affecting the historical process, it can only be clearly seen in a long period of time' [J]. The main reason for the problems and deficiencies in the research of grass-roots anti-right movements by scholars in the past is the lack of consideration of grass-roots anti-right movements for a long period"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": " of time. So to some extent, to this day, the impact of the anti-right movement is far from over [Liu Yiqing, Luolongji, 'The Great Right' that has not yet been reversed [J] Lantai, both inside and outside 2013 (6); Mao Qing, 'Uncle Chen Renbing' [J] 'Yen Huang Spring Autumn 2016 (4)]. \\nAt the same time, we should also recognize that the anti-right movement is part of a series of political movements following the establishment of the nation. Professor Wang Qisheng, Using 'Alpine Rolling Stones' to describe the Continuity and Progression of the 20th Century Chinese Revolution [J] Journal of Central China Normal University (Humanities and Social Science Edition), 2013 (5)], also the 20th Century Chinese Revolution With Progressive' The product. Therefore, anti-right movements must be understood in the context of the 20th century Chinese revolution. The anti-right movement is a link of political movements and a product of the inertia of China's historical development in the 20th century. All people, including right-wing elements, cannot go beyond the track of history's own 'continuous and progressive'. Otherwise, they will become abandoned, which also conforms to Fokor's principle of 'discipline and punishment'. That is, 'All this is for the creation of trained people' [France/Michelle Fuco; Liu Beiceng/Yang Yuan Infant translation 'Training and Punishment: The Birth of Prison' [M] Life Reading New Known Triptych Bookstore 2003]. Even this kind of 'discipline and punishment' has the same effect as 'political hypnosis'. 'You hear every day that you are attacking the party, you are the right. Everyone said everywhere, and said it was said at the meeting, and it was also said in the press that statements in the big print have changed, some are still brilliant. Slowly you will feel that you do attack the party, it is indeed the right, at least will be wondering, not confident' [Ji Xianlin Editor-in-Chief, 'Stories without a plot' [M] Beijing October Literature Publishing House 2000]. Liu Wenkui in this article, while correcting the book to reflect his own problems, added two 'right-wing remarks' to himself, namely, 'provoking relations between workers and farmers cadres and intellectuals' and 'autonomy pride and complacency'. Its purpose is to shift the leadership's sight to the right-wing elements, so that Resolve your problems as soon as possible. Judging from the fate of the five grass-roots right-wing activists in this paper, the consequences of the grass-roots anti-right movement are so serious because the vast majority of the right-wing activists work at the grassroots level, although they do not have their own political luxury, but, 'Compared to the brilliant rhetoric of those democratic party leaders and intellectual elites, this is what they say. Some of the 'right-wing rhetoric' of 'anti-partisan anti-socialism' that the people feel immensely, the rule of the Communist Party may be more It's challenging... because this is really the most likely speech to cause social unrest' [Wang Haiguang's People's 'Right' Speech in 1957 [J] 'Yan Huang Chunqiu 2011 (3)]. This paper uses the personal files of five grass-roots right-wing elements, including Ou yangpu, Anyuan County, supplemented by local history, party history and other data, to carry out a long time combing of grass-roots anti-right movements in Anyuan County, covering a period of 40 years, showing the whole process of grassroots anti-right movement in Anyuan County. The grass-roots anti-right movement in Anyuan County also has its own local specificities. In the revolutionary era, Anyuan County was a place where 'left' leaning is more prominent. However, at the time of the anti-right movement, even though, the number of right-wing elements played was also higher, and the consequences were serious about the results of the treatment of the right. Far less than anywhere else. Anyuan County is in a special geographical position. Among the right-wing elements of Anyuan County, many of the historical counter-revolutionaries involved in organizations such as the Kuomintang Party and other organizations. During the anti-right movement, many of the identified right-wing elements did not prosecute them for counter-revolutionary crimes. In Fuyang, Anhui Province, such cases are labelled as 'double skinned' right-wing elements, refuted and sentenced [Sun Yujie.Right and None: 'Qualitative' and 'Factivism' in grassroots anti-right movement: A case study of anti-right movement and oral data in Boxian, Anhui Province [J] (USA), Contemporary Chinese Study [J] (USA), Study on Contemporary China [J] (USA), Study on Contemporary China (1)]. In Anyuan County, the grass-roots anti-right movement, until the 1980s, there were still right-wing elements that had not been resolved. Ou yangpu is a typical example. It can be seen that a long period of time looking at grassroots anti-right movements is enough to 'test past macro conclusions by historical facts' [Xiao Donglian's Talk about the General Care of China's Contemporary History [J] CCP History Study 2016 (6)]. This paper uses five cases of grass-roots anti-right movement in Anyuan County, supplemented with other information, to study grass-roots anti-right movements and combed the process of grass-roots anti-right movements. However, the lack of field investigations such as oral dictation also leaves room for further expansion of grass-roots anti-right movements."}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】Ou yangxianyu Xianyu: 'My Thought Review' (1957.7)\\n(Original: This material is Ou yangxianyu Xianyu in the Geological Bureau to counter the right-wing climax, using the 'review of my mind' form as an opportunity to vent its carved class hatred to the Party. His review is completely a scam and trick. It is simply not a manifestation of rejuvenation. From this material, it is fully explained how hostile to the Communist Party is towards socialism and how firm the counter-revolutionary position is, as the landowner and the descendants of the counter-revolutionaries, the piety and grandchildren of the anti-revolutionaries. He was not only inseparable to the party and the revolution, but he was full of deep hatred for the entire crowd. (Published here is a summary of the first part of his thought review.), \\nOn political positions and political ideas. Some comrades are specifically looking for flaws, exaggerating the facts reported to their superiors. I am very unhappy with these people, and I hate these irregularities most in my life. On the other hand, at this time, I am not very enthusiastic about the party. Differing views have emerged on certain aspects. For example: All important work can only be performed by party members, international students must be party members to serve. I have different views on this issue. I think the CPC should not do this. I think anyone is willing to contribute their own efforts to build a new China and for the better future of mankind. Amount and life. People who have the ability should be pushed up and let him play their talents. \\nSecondly, I have an opinion on the classification of the political qualities of people into the top, middle and lower categories, based solely on a person's family origin, the historical landscape of the past, and not on the basis of reality and the true intellectual nature. This only makes people lose their sense of pride and glory, and have no personal soul. I think my family origin, a stain in history, is just a shell of history. Especially good people say everything is good, sugar is not slag, bad guys are all bad, pants have no bottom, if you want to mention that person, intentionally exaggerated even his extremely small achievements and advantages, and write a complete system before and after the practice, I have more opinion. In addition, I also have some very small opinions about some of the work of the party and the government. For example, I think this policy is correct and timely, but the total purchase figures for grain have grown up. They do not take into account the actual situation of the current farmers, leaving them out of the actual situation. Many farmers are dissatisfied with some places. And even a riot occurred. ...\\n1. In the summer of 1950, I generated dissatisfaction with the Party's ideological sentiment during the summer of 1950, and I think the Communist Party and the Kuomintang are the same. The Kuomintang was a mess and made China mess. The Communist Party also said it was good, did not do it well, and it was also a mess. I neither believed the KMT nor the Communist Party, and believed in my own party. I also said a joke with others. Marx wrote a capital book about a Communist Party, Sun Yat-sen wrote a tri-democracy and a Kuomintang. I would like to create a doctrine, a doctrine, a doctrine and a different party, better than the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. \\n2. In the next phase of 1950's rent reduction and anti-domination campaign, farmers shouted to export the wind and asked me to pay 1 million yuan, I also generated dissatisfaction. I think the movement was too bad, it was too bad, indiscriminately, messed up, and wanted me also to make a million yuan. \\n3. After my bully father (Shovel Commissant), shot down, I saw that some of the facts published on the counts were not true. I think that the same should not be the case in order to kill people, do not arbitrarily aggravate the crime of the family, and do not engage in 'undesirable' things. When I see the publication of such facts in the newspaper in the future, I do not always believe that there is always something untrue, always exaggerated or written. \\n4. In the autumn of 1951, because I was drunk, the letter shouted Xiao Dazhen as a dog leg, when I did not want to confess mistakenly, so the farmer would punish me for the military family to cut firewood, felt the pain of losing class, felt really frustrated, very angry, and generated serious discontent, at the time and put the mood in the KMT. On, I hope the Kuomintang will come back. I thought: OK, if the KMT calls one day, then you will know me, and I'm going to carry out a massacre! \\n5. In February 1955 in the course of the movement of the 411 team of the former Central South Geological Bureau of Geology, I also emerged discontent, the idea of a trust, specifically Hu Feng thought. The reason is: first, when I first talk about history, everyone's indiscriminate bear took me a meal, say what attitude, my tone is bad. I feel a lot of grievances. I thought that I had this historical stain, and even speaking, had to be angry. \\nSecond, I did a cool analysis of many of the facts and situations that people had treated me before, and I understood that the relationship between people I had understood in school was actually false and not entirely present. Schools in different societies, schools, as long as they were true to the truth, could be said. Can be done, society is different, people look at me in another eye, is standing in different angles me. At this time I knew that the communist people were also people who liked a flatter and flatter. For serious and serious people, they not only did not like, are not happy, but instead look at them in another eye. In the future I have to pretend silly, modesty, pretend more gentle than anyone, on the surface to cater to you, and then drill into your belly, disintegrate you, vertically you do not know anything! \\nSince this time, I felt that the revolutionary family was not warm, not affectionate, and I was very unhappy. \\n6. When I was studying in Beijing \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), I was asked not to see movies (Note: In order to watch the film 'Can't forget this matter' organized by the anti-Hu Feng anti-revolutionary group), I slipped out some of the films that were formula, conceptualized, and I did not love to see them. The more important part of this sentence reflects my mental state of dissatisfaction with the party at that time, and it expresses my inner perception of everything in the Communist Party. Movies often turn a person from backward to progress, and finally to credit everything to the party, which I think is nothing more than the role of the great politics of propaganda politics, in fact, I think it's a little cowhide. \\nWhen the material of Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary group was published in the newspapers, I noticed that the Communist Party would use this 'story' to take advantage of the big name. (The original text is written as an example, the name is written as a name.), \\nI am really not happy during the anti-Hu movement's learning phase, for two reasons: first, I'm not interested in engaging in such a political movement, and I think of doing this campaign and asking me to say some questions in public. Second, the movement has not yet started, some comrades in the party are paying attention to me, releasing some cold arrows.

Shortly after his arrival in Xi'an, he made contact with Wang Jiesan, Li Zhuangyou and Liu different, right-wing activists in the Xi'an area, and ignited around. \\nOn April 29, Chu Anping sent Ou zhipeichipei and Han Hongwen to Xi'an, the 'Guangming Daily' to focus on 'ignition' conspiracy in Xi'an is very obvious. The three people actively organized a symposium 'ignition' in Xi'an. They did not contact the United Front Department of the provincial and municipal committees, stressing the need to rely on democratic parties. However, several impartial persons who attended the symposium, introduced to them by Zhang Guangyuan from the NLD Provincial Committee, were not absorbed to participate. They rely on right-wing Li Zhuangyou. They asked Li Zhuang you to introduce some people who had many opinions and dare to speak to attend the symposium. The list of colloquiums was decided upon after several consultations. Of these, right-wing elements make up the majority. \\nAfter the list was determined, Europe had gone to the United Front Department of the Communist Party of Xi'an Municipal Committee to go to a 'cut-off'. After seeing the list, Deputy Minister Kuan Binghua of the United Front Front Department suggested to him that some people had little representation, some representative persons should be added. Europe stressed that the list was repeatedly studied and determined by the various democratic parties, and the proposal to reject the right to reject the right. Deputy Minister Kwon advised him to consult with the democratic parties again. Europe still did not accept this opinion. However, after Europe came out of the United Front Front Department, instead told people that the list of the symposium was agreed by the United Front Department of the Municipal Committee. \\nIn order to blow this gun, Europe and South Korea, and so on to make this fire more quickly, with the assistance of right-wing activist Li Zhuangyou, also made individual visits to the people who requested the appointment to understand the contents of their statements, and carried out mobilization and advocacy work for those attending the meeting. In front of many people, they boasted the Guangming Daily and deliberately slandered the People's Daily. \\nDuring individual visits, those who had no opinion about the party were disqualified from being invited. For example, Professor Zhang Tonghe from Xi'an Medical College, they learned from Li Zhuangyou that Zhang Tonghe had a lot of opinions and had been listed as the subject of the appointment. While visiting Zhang Tonghe, Ou zhipei asked Zhang, 'I heard that your successful trial of 'prefrontal cutting' was suppressed by the Party Committee?' Zhang said, 'Without this, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee, Xi'an Municipal Committee and the Party Committee of the Academy are very supportive of me. I am still running this operation; that is, some of our peers are opposed to this operation.' After listening to Zhang, I didn't talk about anything more, he erased Zhang Tonghe from the list of whom he was asked. \\nThe symposium was held in the afternoon of May 4 and ended until 10 o'clock at night. OUZIPE in this symposium called on the people to 'have something to say. Because it is the whole wind, the main disadvantages, do not talk about the advantages, you dare to say, we dare, do not fear retaliation, 'Guangming Daily' must be the main support for you.' Europe also said, 'There will be no party members today, this is in order to speak freely, so do not ask party members'... Europe also boasted for Chuanping. \\nThis was the most vicious meeting of right-wing elements in the Xi'an area to attack the party. At the meeting, right-wing elements Wang Jiesan (professor of Xi'an Normal College), Liu Miao, Li Shuli (all professors at Northwestern University), Qian Zhujun (Associate Professor of Northwest University), Prince Yun (Professor of Xi'an Mei-College), and others wanton slander against the leadership of the party, the party's united war policy, and the party's achievements in the anti-opposition movement, etc. (For details, please see the Guangming Daily on May 11th and 12). Qian Jujun, a right-wing member, also in his speech It is very arrogant to assert that the party will collapse next year (this sentence was deleted after the meeting). The right-wing elements also cheer and help each other for their reactionary remarks. European, Zheng and others very much appreciate the insane gesture of the right, they laughed and laughed with the right, and seemed very intimate. But it's cold to those who are more just. For example, Northwest Russian specialist professor Li Weilin outlined his achievements in his speech. Han Hongwen said very impatiently:\\n'What does that mean.' Liu Different and Wang Jie Sanjing, a right-wing activist, criticized Liu Weitong, professor of Xi'an Medical College on the spot, said: 'Your speech does not have much opinion on the Communist Party, there is nothing!' Liu Weitong and Li Weilin, and others recalled the circumstances of the symposium at that time, saying that the right-wing elements at the meeting were very arrogant. They were gazing, talking about them, and they were very happy. 'Guangming Daily' Ou zhipei Zhi Pei, Zheng Xiaofeng and Han Hongwen are also very pleased, often intersecting with the right, and toast to everyone at the midway meal. Rightists believe that this is a success. They are very grateful to the Guangming Daily, calling 'Guangming Daily' as 'their own newspaper.' Liu different said, 'Today's meeting really makes everyone comfortable to talk about it. I can't think of today. If the first two years ago, people will definitely say that we are Hu Feng anti-party group.' The symposium was open until more than 10 o'clock. But none of the right-wing elements are tired. Wang Jiesan excitedly said: 'Such a will open again and not feel tired!' \\nAfter the proceedings of the symposium were published in the Guangming Daily, they shocked a lot among people from all walks of life in Xi'an. A number of honest people expressed their deep dissatisfaction and called the NLD Provincial Committee and asked the NLD Provincial Committee if they knew about the matter. And those right-wing elements rejoice when they saw the Guangming Daily. Some right-wing elements in schools called news units in Xi'an, asking why they did not report their 'revelation', saying that the Party newspaper was not as good as the 'Guangming Daily' and that the Party newspaper did not have freedom of press. And the right-wing elements who participated in the symposium were even more arrogant after the meeting. Wang Jiesan 'set fire' everywhere and made anti-party remarks everywhere. Liu Different, Li Shuli, Qian Zhujun and others became the main right-wing elements. In particular, Liu differs. He was active at Northwestern University and became the head of the right-wing elements of Western University. \\nThe mission of the three 'arsonists' sent by the Guangming Daily to Xi'an was completed. However, the people of the Xi'an region did not allow the anti-party flames to spread. Now, in the fight against the right, the steadfast people are stronger, and those who were bewildered in the past are now awake, and all come together to fight resolutely against the right.
