            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【 Attached】Ai feng: 'One Piece of Right Reflections' ('trace of past events' 15 2009.1.25)\\nThepassage of more than half a century, all my pain, humiliation, remorse have been forgotten, is the best way to heal the pain. \\nThe second approval of the city party under the root\\nReferring to the summer of 1957, it is still embarrassing. In the end of May or early June that year, the whole is the climax, I was suddenly recalled 'Sichuan' department, wuling wulling summoned to the city, the station station, the central spirit of the latest indication . Wu Yun: Li Zheng (refers to Li Jing Quan), the central return to the city, the land committee, the people of the first, so call you back to the. The spirit of the Central Committee is that it is bound to show a rally against the right. If the central examination is put down, there are more middle and lower cantons roll in, the shape is more. Central right wing ten atom, that is, ten heavy anti-articles, the first article is the article, so as to pull back the right (right step back to the right). \\nThe next day I returned to the station of the city. My thoughts are inexplicable: the spirit of the Central Committee, what is the highest and the central work of the central government before it is completely different, what is the same thing? I began to think not to understand. Yes, the anti-right way, I have a dignified degree. With the feeling, I don't necessarily want to rip to me, because I am in the Dao from the city, 'New from' Wen Wang Zhiqian one of the piercing, was from the municipal party party party Beating into a countervailing rush, the rush is very fierce, Wang Zhiqian and others are crying for grievances, asking the municipal party party party, and the municipal party party party has something to do. I figured out the truth, went to the municipal office to find out a copy of the 'Tong', the municipal party party party party party party party on the 'according to' to ask each to criticize. Since then, some people of the municipal party party party have been uneven. Both the public and confess to the public, that is, why do they refuse to do so? And the author gave birth to sympathy. is modeled on the famous man Yakovsky's 'fan', just to change the 'people immersed in the'. But Wang Zhiqian this was made a countermeasure. My uneven character set my life-in my encounter with Wang Zhi, I put this 'according to' the beauty of him. He more vigorously criticized the municipal party party committee, which is political persecution. He pushed the municipal party party party party to enlarge the boom and apologize to Wang Zhixian. This,I have since the municipal party party party once again...\\nIf once I just offended the municipal party party party (because of the 'anti-' incident was caused by him to the end of the incident), then another time is offended the whole city party party The municipal party party party. It was in early June 1956. Since the municipal party party called the head of the outlet, I became a razukawa, and many deputies told me that he was very undemocratic, and even had restraints. The direction of democracy. I made a draft for 'People's Day', 'Let's Make Democracy More Fuller'. To change this 'No, is not, can not be', July 5, 1956. This article caused a big wave from the city, the municipal party party party party is the city of all the criticize this text. \\nIn the anti-right, Wang Zhiqian was beaten to the right, and was forced to confess to me about the fact that the municipal party committee was going through. In this way, the municipal party party party party party, to approve the root cause of the undemocratic root cause, sued the provincial committee, Li Jingquanqian that he instructed Chuanqian to recall me social criticism The materials uncovered in the Cultural Revolution have learned: In the anti-right, Li Jingquan's provincial party committee, the central committee of the six vicissitudes against the right, has also become a lot of irregularities, that is, all those who want democracy during the first time of the province. The right. Since 1958, I learned that one of the right-wing people was arrested because of my approval articles in 'People's Day'. He was a former member of the people's day. \\nThere is still one thing that I have been in my heart, feel unable to help people, feel that I have hurt people. Correction I came back to learn that the comrade, who borrowed me to see the municipal party committee, was also beaten to the right, and the fate of the anti-right is unknown. I forgot his name because there was only one side of it. friends to play, also. If I do not cuddle the uneven, go to check the truth, I will not be able to drag a squad of innocent people into the ground... The tolerance of political obstruction, thus. \\nThe unspeakable thought offender\\nAt theend of June 1957, I was called back to the society and asked me to give my voice to support the crimes of the right and to dig into the roots of my thoughts. In a number of thoughts, I have learned that in the Hirlov anti-Stalin secret, my thoughts on the minds of my thoughts, and the new world proposed a great deal of life, Expose the dark side of life, some of my thoughts. Some ideas are not in any way or in private, I just rely on the teachings that 'nothing can be unspeakable', and set up some ideas. I don't know the right of the river, In the three seats of the new publishing circles of the province and the city, he criticized me for proposing a whole set of, anti-, pointing the spear of the attack to the various committees, and so on. 'Sichuan' September 9, 1957, a version of the second edition of the revelation, 'under the anti-Ai feng's 'innovation'; 'People's Day' on September 13 of the same year: 'Anti, is a right-wing anti-. \\nAll of the ravages and attacks are all of the ravages, and because I am unhappy, I cannot convict by words. But there are some people who engage in political clashes, and are convictions with ideology not the same wisdom? I became mainly a 'thought offender'! I went up:, support from the right to attack, from the right, from the right of the city, the right set of core into the sins, it is worth nothing. The municipal party party party party will not agree to criticize Wang Zhiqian as a repudiation, but he willingly lonely, he is not willing to go alone, and he is not. ? To support the right to attack the right, the core of the right, and so on, in late January 1979, the correction of the, also had to bear: 'check the Yi Yi'. \\nTheabove, I have put me into a right, remove my nationality, administrative administrative withdrawal, only 15 yuan of life per month, devolve the management of the village. By the, I put my big grandmother alive to death; the original in the mid-autumn 1957 married man, and I waited hard for 7 years, had to go...\\nOnce again, I want to re-enter\\nBefore I was beaten into the right molecule has always figured out. I was born out of a family, under the ground, the anti-is the new four people living. I'm small to the middle, many teaching and school are underground, can be small to believe, follow, so don't have to add underground, can be called 'root is Miao'. 16 and two southwest serving Irikawa, in the work of a table is good, and is trusted by. In the whole cry, there is a bloc, how can they become the main anti-social anti-social proponents? Isn't it a big water. \\nIn the face of the right, the article of the 'cares for the contradictions of the people' of the Mao Mao, is a photograph of what I have done. And there is a feeling of being blamed. How can we take faith in the world? But it is wrong to think of the Yuanchun, Ge Pueqi and other people who 'call' the people who have to fight themselves into the right, but the whole anti-right rush is necessary, positive. A lot of anti-social anti-social anti-government opponents have been fooled, and he believes in Chairman Mao. Here, I have awakened to the understanding: since my material is limited and captured, the revelation and so on is really reliable? I am deeply educated, so I still believe in the sins of the right. Even solution: In the big one, the people are also free...\\nNo, in the years of my right, I have been humiliated and discredited, but every man in the theater saw Mao in Tian'an City I am still excited to flow. With this, I still believe that the right faction of Yao Xiaoping in the anti-right complaint has been removed from the blame, and thus desperately to take early hats, enter, and return to the original position. has been repeatedly harassed, and still unenlightened...\\nIt was not until 1959 that I had an intellectual setback. One year, on the one hand, it was a big loss, such as the big shoots, people's communes, public canteens, and so on. On the other hand, people like Peng Dequ and others were fidelity and fidelity and fidelity. I began to wonder about Mao's road, a stalin, the left of the road. I was in the big boom in the day and night of hard labor,, eyes, live life beside me, eyes are a thin muscle, Can according to the get the disease, and a sickle, big to get fat ears, do not hang, batch of workers do not work out of the social; All were beaten into the right, the main elements, were beaten and kicked and tortured. To the anti-right, to the anti-right, look at the right of me together, which has the anti-social anti-social proponents? I have begun to hold a negative degree. Here, I also get to be the Mao road, it is possible to rise to the is the system of, it is a rush against the trend of history and the political, people who want to make a rush...\\nRight Jezhoiah, The Breaking\\nIn the West, some of the people living in democratic governance are some of the people who are known to be the government and the natural clout. He is the conscience of the community, and the watchman of the civil society, he is unhappy, and some of the government, policies, policies and measures may cause bad results from his family and social community. Propose approval, analysis, warning. Some of the people who are known to be repudiated from the public, all of whom have a free mind and standing personality, can be supported and worn by big citizens. The government and the can also often get a little bit of interest, to make a complete picture, so that the whole branch is not perfect,...\\nThehistory of the people who know the people of the Great Revolution, have been given to the left. The left is a reformist, not a clout; the right is conservative and vested interests. Mao is used in the opposite direction, I do not know that it is an understanding of the political history of the West, is the need to make a difference in politics, ideology, and culture? The true right, its is with Mao's head of the and those who clinging to the bangs and literary people; and 1957, the 55 rustist of the right (was worn by each other Hat persecuted person 110 people), is the real left, \\nIn 1964 'Siqing' I was removed from the right-wing hat, thinking that the situation had improved? Still living at 15 yuan per month, still being overseen, still mistranged, allocating jobs all over time, let alone re-entering? My cocks really broke the bottom...\\nForced rebellion, the right to make rebellion\\nIn 1966, the Cultural Revolution was at first hand. At the beginning, I was in the transformation of the position-'Tian' was made as a 'tong outside' molecule. 'Tian', is the province, is the province, into the concentration of the molecules of the, there are more than 30 people, among them with the remaining right (capping, not picking the cap), master, A part of the right masterpiece, there are the historical anti-revolutionaries, the anti-revolutionaries, and so on. Most of the rightists of the provinces (670 people), were relegated and returned to their homes in 1962. \\nAs a result, I was beaten up as a member of the 'outsiders', only because my former married people were Hong Kong people, the 'liberation' of Huizhou, that is, to go back to the center of the province, originally working in the provincial hospital. She waited for five years to improve my political problems, and she was forced several times to get her back to her home. She had to go home on leave in 1962 because of her mother's illness and was blocked by her parents, but I kept my close communication system until the spring of 1964. \\nIn the 'February Counterattack' in 1967, the throne again turned me into an anti-revolution, and a little squeezing. All of them have denied the backlash, the position is still unhappy, I am enduring, I thought: I do not create rebellion is counter-revolutionary, and at best it is counter-revolutionary. Only the rebellion can you figure out what is really trying to do, and what the hell of Mao's hobby. Yes, I went to show the management of the main people, he answered the right to pick up the hat can be revolved. The next day I was in the position of a big word,,The purpose is to criticize That is, more than 10 people have long been capped the right wing, criticized the deputy of the administration of politics and law and law and the Department of Correctional Services, and also criticized the big critique of the city, but not Live, do not martial arts, and also call the city to promote a great deal. due to the revelation to,, by the repercussions. I set up a rebellion, and the discipline department ran back home, and the order of life had to be presided over by me, and the order of life was still well established. \\nIn the period of the Cultural Revolution, 'one dozen three anti-anti', caught 5.16 molecules, I was again beaten up, and I was first put into the Dafai, and made me a curtain. It is also the political and legal committee of the political and law-making committee beaten up as a counter-revolutionary rally, and the criticized fixing of the culture. I was caught, Lin Biao's escape incident happened to the. Probably above there are spiritual and social contradictions, and put my class back to its position and accept criticism. I was set to have a counter-revolutionary hat on a man, not old, can be put on (fancy tyranny, how much is it?). In 1974, Li Dazhang, deputy director of the provincial revolutionary committee, Li Dazhang (former province), asked for assignment of work, complaining that the hat has been picked up for 10 years and is still in the transformation. This letter was raised, irritated the political and legal committee, and I and two other people (the right wing of the Xinqian branch of Sichuan branch, the right hand of the provincial political and legal committee), the whole group, was put on the line. Anti-revolutionalist hats, controlled for three years, respectively, were shown by the martial law on three large Ka Yao Street. In this case, I have a problem with the deputy who is in charge of political law and law and who is criticized by me, as well as the repudiation. I'm going to go to him, and I'm going to find him. I want to get rid of the material, ask for rehabilitative, I go to find instead to hide. \\nI saw the rumbling rain on the Cultural Revolution, but also saw the purpose of the whole man. Mao, the government, and the people are all playing in the hands of their own hands. His law is deception and violence (group violence or more violence), fully exposing the very essence of his wrestlers. 'Father is not dead, not dead'! \\nPeak back to the road, back to the river\\nIn 1979, I was corrected back to Chuanqu, the first to become Yongchuan, Chengdu and other cities of the station and the people. The first five years of the 80s is the most comfortable, most fulfilling 5 years of my life. I have a lot of people who want to return the lost youth, working day and night to work, village and school, especially in the first year, I have a draft every day, and I have a lot to call: I can't do it again. Because there are more than one layout. I do not get a lot of new, unraveled, a lot of people, social and. old colleagues are doubtful: the old boy 22 years, can be a man? I want to look at him with the line: I can not pamper the man, can be good for a multifaceted man! Some or eye-catching or rustling rush, some and are in the back: Ai feng is the material of a man! \\nSince 1986, I changed to Chuanqu 'democracy and legal system' moderator. Each issue will be published in each issue of the manuscripts of judgements or captures. Each issue is published 'Citizen Letter', I have or Home Answers. Therefore, there is no big shadow in the political and legal circles of the province, and there is a reversal in all. Shanghai 'Democracy and Legal System' Zhi appointed my special invitee, and a comrade of the Ministry of Justice wrote a comrade about this edition. In less than five years, I have been a blind law to hold the law, in the province's public security, courts, law and law department, I have a wide range of people. \\nSince 1990, I have been reappointed to Chuanqian New Research Institute, the core journal 'New Dept', and changed to research new management. I made the 'New World' a lot of research, and I made a number of research articles. Some articles were covered by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Master's 'New Year of the Year', one of which was completely reformed In 20 years, the research of the new, the provincial government Soon, I was hired by professor of Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences and became a new institute of Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences. The students approved by the Home Education Committee were awarded to the graduate student. In this group of graduate students, some have been admitted to Ph.D., some have been put into the southern day, the new day, and some are distributed in...\\nI published a new article and a new piece of work, and three of the Master's Research. Some of the works of my and have been repeatedly affected by the central government, provincial government and social science. In 1998, he was also appointed to 'Sichuan new', at the end of 2002, fast, 70 years only to rest. \\nThe system does not change,\\nIn my early 80s, and 6.4, my and my gave birth to some deepening, is Mao's people. , rise to the system to negate the。 The system does not change. It has not changed, it is not the Mao, and Li Qiao, and the necessity of suspicion and negation of the need for anti-right rush, rises to the extent that it is an abusive attempt to persecute the known elements. Every system of cantons, the public knowledge of the people, so if Mao Xun lives in the generation, is either jail, is jail, and he is an old man-and Mao's life is very little old. ..."}

He has published a collection of works. Making people, he and his works soon like a meteor, a decade has almost been forgotten. Looking back to Wang Zhanqian's life, you can find his dreadful life, 'Wenqu', 'New people late', Guo Lianghui and so on to find his flawed life. \\nWang A zhan is the nephew of Ke In 1943, Ke in replacing the butterflies into the main 'elephant' Zhi's waiting, the old nephew Wang Zhan summoned busy. Wang Zhanyuan soon debut under the name of 'Azhan' in the third year of the second phase of '', the first work 'spiral', revealing his writing skills and talents. 'elephant' per month, each issue of 20 words 200 pictures, in the near years, Ke Wang Zhanqian and another assistant young children have to complete such a huge workload. thought, 'elephant' in the zhi has become the social, cultural, literary elephant of the Chinese and foreign people to study the. Wang Zhanqian is doing the work of the same man, in the 'Elephant' in his work, and raised his work. \\n' Wenhu' is the bed of Wang Zhanqu Zhuo. Resistance to Japan, Ke Wang Zhanqian and young children to his 'Zhou' work. 'Zhou Yun' was suspended. Wang Zhanqian went to the master of Li Jianwu's 'Wen Yu' to work for school work. The Shanghai publishing company of 'Wenxu' and 'Zhou Xuan' is a large Japanese surrender to Shanghai publishing company. A man who has a lot of film in all of the quanzi, is also the three people of Zen Zheng, Lee Kin Wu and Wang Zhanqian. Azhan's culmination in the 40s and half, he in the middle of the in the middle of Wang Zengqi to start, in Mao Dun, Bajin, and other famous 'On the table 4 small。 Li Jianwu,\\He is very useful,Xiao,,I also he in the 'Wen' on the table of the West'. Li Jianyu can be the second man of Wang Zhanqian, with Wang Zhanqian, Wang Zhanqian received a large number of famous writers in the works of the school's famous masterpiece. In more than a year, he published three small episodes: 'The Village' (March 1948), and 'Late' (February 1949), 'Closer' (April 1949). Wang Zhanqian's works have been rewarded by former writers, and his masterpieces are lined up with his masterpieces. 'The Village' is included in the 'New Edition' published by Yun Ming Yao Store; the tenth episode of the 'Wen Xuan' of the 'Wen Xuan'. The sea famous Wei Jiecheng, 'late' due to Shanghai Chaohao Publishing House afraid of the present, Wang Zhanqian Ming Ming Ming, published by Wang Zhanyuan Ming. There is a collection of works by Yun Ping, Yun Xi Ruo, and Yoshan, etc. Prior to this, in September 1947, Qunli Publishing House published 'The First', 'The Restoration of Humanity', had received Wang Zhanqian's short story ''. Wang Zhanqian's little is mostly derived from people, with heavy zhejiang features. \\nTang Tao, Ella, Xu Qiao, Yonghu Yonghu, Tang Yung Yu, Tang Yun, and other people have forgotten their fellow people in the 40s, his article has a snippet of Wang Zhanqian's text. , Wang Zhanqian's friends are Yong Yu,,. In his article, 'I was in the cultural life publishing house and Barkin and Rancy, 'Juvenile objects', 'I was in the cultural life publishing house and Bakin and Rancy, 'Juvenile objects', and. The Duke's supplement 'Wen', Ah A zhan and Tang Tao 'Wen' supplement, are all assistants. Yongyu, he is wandering Shanghai, and I live with me. I have four small young people together, a cup of tea, a box of incense, sea sky, up and down ancient and present, a chat is more than half a day, both arrogant, and I do not know the heights thick. 'In the back, it's really romantic.' That was the year of youth, and the achievements of the past had a lot of untold results. Wang Zhanqian's three short stories made him a little writer. However, Wang Zhanqian has a wang fruit and is also in the narrow and empty years of the year, and then the quintesssence of the masterpiece. \\nIn the second half of the 40s, Wang went to Shanghai 'Xinmin' (the predecessor of 'Xinmin'), as a school. The liberation of his 'New People's Night' as a man, the master of the of the weekly magazine. He also has his works in the book, but more works have been made, but more works have been published in the collection. \\nIn 1957, the old man returned to Wang Zhanqian's 'dare words' was the whole public.

Ke Yun once fought the whereabouts of Azhan, who is also living in Qinghai, and mentioned his nephew in the letter of his friend. Li Jianwu Wang Zhanyu, ten years ago, said Azhan: 'A man of hope! Can you say that he is not going into another Wang Zengqi today?' \\nThestory of Wang Zhanqian, famous female writer Kwok Lianghui Wang Zhanqian, I taste the imprint of a period of green and yong moon. In June 8, 2014, the former deputy of 'New People's Late Yao', the old man Yun Lin Yao made a table of 'The Most Beautiful Writer' article, describing the interaction between Wang Zhanqian and Kwok Lianghui. In the second half of 1947, Kuo Lianghui, a man with a background to the new people, worked for 'New People', and she was placed at school. Kuo Lianghui and Wang Zhanqian people are just like so, the old man, the old man, the old man, the old man, this is looking for Wang Zhanqu to ask him to Three mu Yueong, Wang Zhanyuan short encounter with Guo Lianghui to go. The story is finished, in the spring of 1998, Guo Lianghui as a 'famous female writer' to Dao Dao, she went to Shanghai, proposed to return to the 'new people' ('new people late'), see Former old colleague. Lin in the article depicted the story, words and lines, I feel, is Wang Zhanqian's life for ten years, there is a lot of friends and friends:\\nScattered seat, Shadow Remedies. And she quietly hung me again: 'Azhan nothing?' Azhan is her real old colleague old friend. \\nI felt suddenly: 'He's not there anymore. In 1957, he was sent to the right, sent to Qinghai to reform, and died in the death of the death of all four decades.' \\n' How about Azhan...'\\n' He is very happy, unlike my old man, he dare to dare to dare to dare... that every sentence can be turned to the right.' \\nShe was silent, gloomy, smiled and smiled, smiled, shammed to the owner. \\n' Azhan is her real old colleague old friend'. It is probably also a solace to the wow of the soul and the unknowingly wreaked Wang Zhanqian. \\nPAGE \\nPAGE 1"}

Is the reference to 'coexistence and mutual supervision' incorrectly? Because 'coexistence and mutual supervision' is an equal plea of the parties, etc., it cannot be treated equally with an unequal party. The former co-ordination and the democratic clandestine are the cantons and the grabbed lines, and their status is different; the common ridicule is big, and the democracies are not big, how are the small ones overseen? is a contradiction, if the period coexist, under the circumstances, mutual supervision is not a solution. \\nJudging by the things to go, the democratic faction can only mention the finished product proposed by the Communist Party. For example, a total of people put forward a single document, the democratic faction will change the word on the document, like Replace the word 'with the word', 'I' to 'everyone' and so on. Democratic tribes can only construct, they can't make any effort. They don't want to do anything, and the democratic tribes are in a position to help them, and they are accused of helping them. Therefore, they coexist and supervise each other over time. hat is not snapped.

How democratic parties play a role Be sure to coexist during the period, supervise each other, how to do it? also need to solve. \\nThe role of thedemocratic faction is fully abiding by his role, and he does not want to make construction work, and he wants to do it. It is necessary to understand the feelings, to grasp the material, and no longer to go hand in hand, it will aggravate the remanence of the democratic parties. My family is a worker, how the direction of the family is built, and I will all want to work together to study the governing party and protect it together. Naturally, the status of the democratic tribe also needs to be changed, whether it is possible to see how it can be lifted out by sitting on an equal footing. \\nIn practice, the establishment of intellectuals, the Democratic League, the Democratic League, the Democratic People's Party, the People's Work, and the Ninth and the Third Democratic Party will join together to set up political clerks The people of the revolution are the people of the revolution. At present, some of the nationalities of democracy are different, some three or five, and some hundreds of people.

I was guilty of teaching the Lord, the new shape of the incomprehension, I have a sentence of 'stewed cow knife', but I use a cow knife, the fruit is not lost. It is completely necessary for him to be involved in the first five years and the third year, because on the one hand, he called for work and cooperation. On the other hand, rich and anti-revolutionary work, the public rally out, engage in a collection, with the same man by the foreign affair, the social leader and his family is only one, and he is covered by the master's family, if he is not repudiated, the social protagonist The building will not succeed. And what about me? 1955 is also the first five years of the third year, the eve of the family of the family of the social, is a , the fruit is not to lose. I have laid out the 'law' that my family is settled, and he is a man who is an abusive man. And it is not a pity. Then by the Bureau, in 1955, he called out, four outsiders were summoned, and the central government announced that the bureau was sure to be. Therefore, my repudiation is a trick. \\nIn the column of the master is a total of package, its package can not, generally can also be used to get the main. But the is set to be a xuan, the more the protagonist of Stalin, the more it is the master of the society, the more the, the more it is, and in the I'm going to be.

He knew that the people wanted democracy and freedom. I see today's ', put', that is to say, unleashing democracy, freedom, and 'putting it up' every day.

If I do not 'put,' I will not change the 'doing less, less', and less to 'do less, less', I want to 'put' to 'put' Solution. \\nLast time, there were three pieces of loss: 1. The national culture that affected the five thousand years of China, so that everyone could not go, friends could not go to, the same It is a life that is not identical.

Wang's wife of a certain Wang (real name Wang Qi'an, whose name is still living in place, and his children's face, his real name), was caught by the officer, dragged to the empty house, and the soldiers stood outside. Twelve young girls were also raped. \\nIn the northwest suburbs of Shen, there is a Japanese called '581', Japan surrender, social order, some people Supplies, such as leather shoes, sweaters, futons, etc., carry back to the, there is also a vapor pull some of the products. Xu Jiji of my village lives in the village. One morning, he tried to get cheap, he went to the village west of the village. a soldier, Ji searched his body, turned him up, Xu Ji Kenshede, went back to the back, but he was left. He was very distressed and stood under the willow. Not much, the soldiers and find a soldier, previously the soldier with a finger Xu Jiji, meaning he back to the back, not old. Before you come up, Ji, the Xu Jiji hit the whole village all over the village. That year I was 10 years, that horrible wowl that my heart would jump out. One man in all the villages dared to go to rescue, and his family did not dare. A half a small has a sound, the village people dare out, the big nose soldiers have gone, go to see Xu Qiji, has been beaten bloody, long ago dead. \\nIn the northern suburbs of Shen Dao, there is a to the west of the river, people in Shenghu city call it Bei Qianhe, that all call it two Dao, I'm under the Kanzi village people call it Shaheyan, winter Dry river ice, people close to the ice. In the winter of 1945, there was a Dagu road, near my village, the old man, sat the old girl. Tucked a pier officer, the girl was raped, to finish the job to grasp the tires. The old cry crying: 'My girl is spoiled, grasping tires, can go? How come home? I have been a little Japan for 14 years, and by the old hairy, the rake girl...' It happened to be the police road, Ben Dare not to control, but the old man cries, one of them is called Xu And the cop of Kyiichi provoked him, and went out, and he smashed the leg of the officer. Sitting on the ground, you can't stop the slap. Another policeman Yuqing: 'Where can you go? It's so hateful!' He was also sinned, and he was very happy. \\nHowever, in 1952, the liberation of Xu Jingyi, Yuqing two people pulled out, and pulled to the big platform outside my village, kneeling, around the neck, there were 'prisoners' Three characters of the big brand, criticized, people to again. \\nAnother man, a Mr. (I asked for his name), this year 80 years, the last 50's admitted to the Ha Department of the Communist Youth Department, joined the A total of. His wife was co-school, and he was a cohort. In 1957, he was removed from his nationality because of the atrocities committed in 1945, and his wife was repudiated. Mr. Mister's old companion so far has a palpitation, once the history of remembrance of grievances, he will not be remiss the old man again, fear of reopening the history of the remembrance of the offender and the woman, because of his The children are all family members, together. \\nThe most typical and well-known are the vice-chairman of the Central People's Government of the Central People's Republic of China, Vice Chairman of the Southwest Executive Committee, and vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the People's Republic of China. Because of his suspicion, he was added to the crime of 'anti-rebellion' and the right hat was added to the crime of 'rebellion'. Dead. \\nMany of the anti-right people have been caught in the 'rush' because of their atrocities. It is only because of the case, I know exactly how many people have been wronged. \\n( III)\\nA whole generation of people who witnessed, unraveled things, unraveled people,, seal the mouth of the people, the enterprise to cause humiliation and haunting of the people. It seems that the history of the history has been blamed by the demise of the people, and it seems that there are atrocities that have been rampant. Is the whole national rush and discouraged. However, it is futile for enterprises to use violent means to force the people to lose their lives. Its fruit, its rampant force increases and stimulation. In the history of the Qin Territorial Emperor, and even the cultural revolution, who have lost thousands of dead soldiers and small soldiers who have lost their own people. Because of this, human beings have a human conscience that cannot be subjugated by any violence, and no mercy or desire can be deceived.

Period, its educational ideology, school and teaching the shadow of deep. First of all, he made a great deal and heights, and he often called 'children like the father and brother of the man'.

To find the common people to climb, understand their feelings, and whip the whip and go. Some people told that this person was a rush, and the ordinary people bowed: Ah! Fortunately to the Anda, why don't you give me early? He went to the house to go to the house, and some of the sentiments made it immediately to solve the problem. This is very much, privately, I don't know things, all know, no longer dare to be tiger, so the officials of the lower are in awe. On the Ping's clothing, Chang Xi, Dao, a table talents Qin An children's brother (tone), Because of the past, the shoes are shoes made by its lady. The true work of the Father and his work is deeply affected by the workers and the ordinary people. During his term of office, he did something useful in addition to performing the general public service. One is to host the publication of 'Tianshui', zhi work order ('Tianshui Zhi' folk version). In the order 'Gan on the river, Qinzhou on the heavy, and the tianshui that was the former Qinzhou straight and south of the also, landscape show, lush forest, People, since ancient duo people, cai, Yuan Fu Xi culture ancestor, Yu Rongge has, Wu Gong, Ju Zong Xue Xue Xia Jiang, Li Wang Jue, Wen Yun Li Ling Yiyi, Zhong Like Yin Daquan, and humble style. To the name of the gossip, too often in the platform of the gossip, Taihao, the Tomb of Ge, the city of Duling, the site of Du Ling cathedral, also not enough for people to hang out also... The bitterness, the bitterness, both the law and the speed of the process, forget its bad order. Twenty-five years of winter scenery Taian Li. Second, in mid-October 1936, 20 female comrades, such as South Emblem, Cheng and Kang, and others, and some of the people who were unhappy, and some of the people who had been made, were handed over to him, identified. All judged the people of the people to go home in situ, and how clear the hearts of the people of their humanitarians. \\nDuring theperiod of resistance against Japan, the Father struggled to devote himself to the defiance of God. In 1939, the father was sent to the central government. I joined the in the period. The second branch of the Nanjing Dept Department, from Kai-kai, was a foreign military officer of the matter. In June 1941, the Ministry of Political Affairs was a deputy, June 1946, also heavy mortar fifteenth (). One of the dearth is one of the people. The soldiers are almost completely illiterate, the soldiers, that is, the mechanized soldiers who are called by the students. From Hubei, Hunan to Sichuan. By the branch of the special, is the soldier and the good, official Bai Chongxi Guan, Cheng Jiao. The factions of the people are lined up, clear and dark, to save the power to do a shield, all should not be put into a rush, fighting often in the outer circle, there is a real big mock. It is also just a stand-by, doomed. A lively Chinese culture, the father presided over the monthly magazine 'Zigo'. The title means to bring down the Japanese emperor's Lord, stop and seek peace. In 1941, in the heavy Gan zhi donation, the table 'Mr. Gan Ying Gan' and other articles; 1945 in the 'The World in the Shape' One article. In 1946, with the idea of the father to dissipate the sorrow, nai, the time of the quantum. \\nAt the end of 1948, the father was appointed to the Office of the Civil Affairs Officer's Office, Gao Qiao Yao. The people are repulsing against the politics of the people, and in each of them. In the liberation, he will have no doubt as to his political affairs. is disgusted, tired of his career, wanting to go home to old. People who want to flee, all people who want to flee, the way out, the people (Qing and the United States, as the commander of Taiwanese), Zeng: the last time I went to Dian, you went to Dian to fight against Japan. He has returned to the power of heaven, better I go to Taiwan together to work together. He gave it a gulf. He also called him to go to Taiwan with Bai Chong Hei. The Father thought, I am a people in the Northwest with thin strength, one by the mountains, two people, and can go and what, only hope to disarm the field. Bai gave him a secret letter, asking him to send him to Bu Fang. He was drumming and waiting for his foreign aid to come. The Father is ridiculous, but it is not good to push it. In August 1949, he sent a letter from Bai Bu Fang on behalf of the official's office in Qianzhou, in the northwest of China. He intends to retain his father and arrange for the public office to be less than able to do so, but it was not possible to travel by the Bureau. The father has a hobby, four boxes of origin close to a thousand. Most of the history, there are some literature and some foreign languages. Such as 'History', 'Yizhi', 'Twenty-Four History' and so on. There are a few This crown Anritsu words,, all famed, is also doing a good thing. Can not be the day, the first wild to row the mountains down the sea to attack the state. Yao Bufang has long escaped, deputy officer to head to Hexi to flee. To Ye Ye, I do not know how to get news, send father people, Qiqian mountain to find the love, to Jiuquan. Father in the mountains day, not shadows, had to go to Jiuquan sex. The Ren has also escaped, and the Public Office's Tao Chi-chee (deputy officer), ordered to take the order, the public office, Peng Ding, and the father is also a pioneer. The commander of Ichino, Wang Zhenghuan, took over him, the policy, and noticed that Xinjiang's can work together, can go home without hesitation, and still treat people. The Father told Wang Qiao about his feelings, and for many years in the foreign years, was also big, willing to go home. The commander of the king knows that he is a Ganzao people, and he also gave him a special mandate, with the liberation representative, went to the place of death and resistance. The Father went away, but the descending did not work. Motobe was liberated. \\nIn September 1949, the father of Jiuquan returned to the liberated province. It was a year when he came to Chishu, Father. The Father has been steeped in politics for many years, but without sacred. My life is all dependent on friends, the house is rented, some of the house is borrowed. In December 1950, the northwest command appointed the father of the northwest room (the decree includes commander Peng Deqian, political commissar Gan Siqi, etc.). The father and father officially became a in the liberation of the people. In the five years of the room, he is the writings of the Mao, En, Lieh, and Si, and 'Mao', political affairs and policies. Second, self-examination. is an account of history,, self-thought transformation. Because the father was 'wenwu all' of the 'great knowledge of the ocean', and adhering to the pride of sex. In the atmosphere, there are many people's approval. Third,. Anti American aid in the North, the United States emperor has been I The father is the use of, overtime work at night to complete the work, and receive the table. The manuscripts are handed over to the headquarters, and to the Zhi Qiao headquarters. Fourth,. When everyone was appointed with him, they were revolutionaries. However, according to the policy, like a man who is his own, has to try to meet the requirements for three years in order to get the 'revolutionary man'. In 3 years, you have the brand of 'light' in the home. Five is teaching. The highest level of culture is the father. In 1952, the Ministry took him to the Department of Political Affairs, the Ministry of Political Affairs, and taught the culture, and taught the (generation, Ho), a year. Cheng, 1953, second class,. He was very excited, room director: 'I'm on the good, do not need to work well, I don't feel I dare, I don't dare, is canceled.' Director: 'is on the quantum, not only do you teach a good reflection, winter cold you go to school every day, the classroom is on fire, classroom feel warm like spring, everyone is dying you gongli, and your has been sent to the command headquarters, some of the rush has been used, some of the other comrades are unaware of, and you work affirmatively and drumming.' On the other hand, he sent him back to his home, and the local government made good news to the social community. , in the room,, reinventing ideas, fetal bones, reacting people, working hard, people to serve. It is not easy for the people to do some work. In 1955, the room was evacuated, the father of the into the provincial people's committee. \\nTo the affairs room, the father made more efforts, and some social activities, such as attending provincial government and provincial people's congresses, ideological understanding improved quickly. Zeng master shen to Tianshui and private business people's social reformation, his work and love,, and work. He felt deeply under the times. In 1956, he laid down the sixty-four lines of 'Tianshui private reform work'. Zhong Zeng: The education training of long, the people will not be able to take their minds. I got the in the bake and once again took off the master. He walked to the main avenue, a step to transform the private business and business of Yan Shang Guang Yun, in the new... is also a bit of his own, steeped in. In July 1956, the father joined the People's Revolutionary Committee and became deputy director of the provincial people's revolutionary society. He turned out the 'New Generation' (English), 'The Spirit of the People's Generation'. Many people quashed 'Wizards'. \\nIn 1957, exhibited a fierce and fierce, call people to magnify,. In the release, some people the famous Sichuan Liusha River's 'grass articles', even defiance is a big poisonous grass. Mr. in the whole seat of the abstracts is 'for the 'grass article', in the text (): If I am the author, then I will make the following interpretation of the essay in 'grass': She, a pier of light, stood alone in the plain, with high fingers, and pulled her out. But if she died, her waist would not be swallowed. (My understanding is: it is the spirit of the character of the song, the spirit of the truth and death). Two, the vine: he clove, climb up, climb up... flowers in the shoots. Cloves were killed and cut into firewood. He fell to the ground, pampering, wrestling another one... (the solution is: anti to build his happiness on top of the pain of others, or it is against some people's steepless, the people beat up.), Three, the cactus: she does not want to use the flower to the owner, covered with bayonet. The master expelled her from the flower, nor did he drink water. In the wild flower, in the desert, she live, breed the woman... (meant to hold the original, isolated). Fourth, Mei: in the sisters, her love is the most. Spring, flowers with beautiful laughing citation butterflies, she put herself quietly with the winter snow, butterflies do not deserve to kiss her, just as the flower does not deserve to be a snow. She laughed laughed the most beautiful in her sister. (meaning not humble, Ting Yuli). The common saying, the words of words, love, the understanding of the people, each with the ground, to the true enlightenment, can only be the people. No one wants to 'snap the hat'. There was no backlash, but his own bumpy road was laid down. The people's day 'is what' social rush, the direction of the rush, blows the anti-right corner. And the numbness of the people are sober, and they are talking to them. He is the most typical of them. In the small,'social' table some views and construction, most of them all the unjust, and the ritual is very good, in the big. Well, so long as he made a big deal, answer the 'Gan' on a big deal: 'Anritsu People's Day' 'What is it?' , He listed a bunch of charges, one night, vaguely confused, and did not understand, the father suddenly became a famous right-wing. The critique of the month, the father was suffering suffering suffering from pain, the most curtailed understanding is: to remove the rightist Anritsu's public, stop working, send to Dunhuang cotton. And the father, the sickly and sicky body, he was plagued. And the figure of the Father is imprinted in my boss. \\nHe knows that it is the most curse of me and the Father. No, the old and sick father can not bear that heavy power. 'I have anti-social anti-social prowess', 'I have anti-social rebellion', 'I have a clear confession', and so on. And the people are in that age, in the transformation of the system, he will live again in Zunli, the little people, he carries the, and he is on the ground, and he stands in the ground, until ,Only。 He looked up. On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the father people to play his own vegetables, only: 'You eat it, I eat it is also a wave'. Out of the, the most jumped into the water well, a living, probably to show innocence! He finished his own journey of life. Fall 1958, 56 years old. Truly: the world is vast, autumn and rain; I fame like a fame, what is the merits? In the Cultural Revolution, the family was robbed again, and all documents and other items were copied and paid for the flow. I have also been subjected to political force for a period of time. \\nHeaven and earth, sun and moon back In the eleven three of the eleven to seek, anyway, the sky again out of the light, people like Mu Chun. Until April 8, 1981, the provincial committee agreed to correct the Anritsu and the right to withdraw the original characterization and division, and restore political name. I am not happy to receive the notification, the father went into the 'Ganqu province'. \\nIn 1936, Gansu province Jingtai people, 1958, the northwest of the hospital (in the northwest), Department of physics, in Guanzhou II teaching. 1983 into the seven middle school in Qianzhou until retirement. In 1996, he was taught in the Ganqian province, and his affair was thrown into the 'Ganqu family'.] \\nPAGE \\nPAGE 2"}

Nanjing was invaded by the Japanese emperor lord, the people of Zhejiang and Zhejiang Yizu fled to,, and Sichuan. It has also become one of the places where many people are gathered. Small cities with less than 14 people, soared to more than 30. \\nOne day, I had an unhappy woman, and she was a little woman. She is a famous composer Qu Xiqu. I do not know where she is with her mother. But she lived in my house for more than a month, most of my mother and her mother and daughter had a ticket to get a heavy ticket.

For example, 'can be the autumn incense' in the song: 'can be the autumn incense, she has a big sister Dad, two sister, Qiu incense every day can only sheep on grass, shepherd...'\\nResistance to Japan, she also sings 'Yam', 'The sword to the devil's pier', '918' and so on. I was also under her pottery, and I had a song of anti-Japanese songs. Her good is also a peculiar,Joy,Joy to see the shadow (I get the original black and white film,To there is a slice)。 I was also in her shadow, and I got up to Beijing. In the video she went to see, the doo was upward and provoked against the Japanese. I was very impressed with 'Midnight Song', 'A River Spring Water Flows' and so on. \\nIn the midst of the resistance, the Japanese began to take my Ozukata,, and Kawasaki and other places to fry the wild. On February 4, 1939, the ravages were torn by Japan. On the day I got the police, my mother told me to go to Ren Kecheng (also an elder), home defense shelter, and she herself was guarding her home, and she looked at her grandmother.

The school has moved to a dozen more than 10 from the city. \\nI live in school, but on Sunday to go more than 20 roads, and many places are wilderness. One time my sister sent me, I did not go down the road to the jackal, and watched a bunch of jackals whirling. My mother, and immediately I stopped not going to go to the German. Shu Ding takes the home to Shuikouji Temple. It is just the central daemun to the heavy, with its gulf to the Anshan, Suikou Temple is only a stone of a stone. I was admitted to the Central Daequ Middle School for one year. The school is a boarding system. I became a boarder and came home every Saturday. It was not that whatsoever, the mother turned his home back to the city street, but the family had rented a room for rent, and had to rent a house in the Xu family. Duan, life than Ping, go home on Saturday, mother I go to Street (now in the North Road), to eat Wang noodles, to the big three yuan to eat crispy buns. Because she knew that I was happy to eat. Family life is unabated. Every year only live on the tenancy income of the 60 Stone Baogu Valley, which is divided in my name. Baogu is more than the bounty, years are not enough, can only Yin eat, by borrowing the day. She eats very well and paid less. Fortunately, I was at school, I was eating with public haunting, and I was also free to pay off, just spend some of them every year. The days were until 1944. \\nIn the winter of 1944, the Japanese aggression hit the Mt. The mother had a part of the clothes, and he owed (I had a hundred yuan of the was back to send to his family), and I and my grandmother, and the sister four people went back to his home. I had to walk to Ann, a total of three days. Grandma was old, and I could only sit on a steep. To the Ann is walking to Puding, Ran only on the slide bar (that is, with a bamboo cane in a bamboo stick in a bamboo like a seat, by to the shuttle Soga is the home of my five father, five peers have died prematurely, only five pebble and her son Jin and new (because of the five bets and the golden family, the name Jin), female Ann Ruiying. Because I was close to my land, so I went to Soga. Five people are very good, I very high, deliberately put four rooms and a I got under. It was the first time that I returned to the place where my Father was born. I am also happy to walk in addition to the work. I go to the famous 'window hole', go to, go to my second brother Anke Geng family. By the beginning of 1945, the school had gone, and I went back for the second time, and completed my most year of high school. Mother and grandmother, the sister has been living in Soga. \\nIn the summer of 1945, I lost my high school. And because the bouncy of the family was more troubled, I returned to my mother. Soon, because my friend Zhou Jin told me in a letter that I could arrange accommodation in the test test; it happened that my new brother's wife, the brother of the sister-in-law, was also working hard. My mother, I go to the heavy, I once again went out of the mess. I was late in the test school. How much has been admitted to the examination, only one is left in the enlistment. It is not optimistic in my eyes. It is my examination of science and technology. Only to Qinghai, Jiaotong University, Wu Da, Zhejiang University, etc. But both, can't go home without a school exam. I was in a heavy test test. However, there are only ten people in the group, and there are thousands of candidates. I thought that if I couldn't take the test, it was not the 'bottom' of all the names of the 'bottom'. \\nAfter the exam, I was in the back of the day, and I returned to the news. Fortunately soon, I took the second place to take the second place into the system. This I spent half a year of zero month in the daemun department. One is because of the Dao Zhou only I half a public, the second is because I am to the heart of the famous brand, in the second half of the year will not complain, back to home, then go out for examination. \\n, anti-Japanese has been more than a year, I returned to Soga, the mother also gave birth to a great deal. The mother's body is based on, not fat, not thin,, still a black, benevolent smile, eternal is the natural. But she did something, I forgot. One thing is that she changes to the practice of mainly filial motherhood, and the Lord went to the school of Soga Xiaobu. The original is a small broken, little little life. She knows that the Lord is asking for a solicitation, and he has enlisted the Miao children of more than twenty vicinity of Zhouqu, and he waived him. Put the first small finished small. I borrowed five or six mountain roads in the Soga Street. The mother is holding to school every day, and he is also serving as a number of chengcheng. \\nIn 1989, I returned to Soga, that day coincided with the collection, I don't know more than 50 people know I am Gao Nan, he extended his thumbs out: Universities are really good people.' \\nOne is that I have people living in my home. A man is called yong, a woman's name is Ho Yizu, is the old man. 'Lang Dai,' he is a 'lang dai riot'-is the first time the Communist Party of China's subterranean, lost, the mother took him under cover, and he was taught. One is a sister married, gave birth to a boy. My sister has been in my home for more than 20 years. More than 30 years ago, she has not married a man. Her mother is very concerned about her problems, and many matches have been successful, and more than a year ago, she became an affair. Originally there are 30 young people of Henan origin, surname, in the anti-Japanese soldiers, flowing to, mother, youths than, put him into the home, to help some Slowly, he and his sister became familiar with the understanding that he became married, but also the mother's heart. Three things are big, some small, but imprint the mother often used to flooded 'innate,' the mother's chest of the mother. The mother supported me out to test, broke the ban of the family, rallied to the ten stone bag valley, gathered more than 100, sent me to Hangzhou, who knows the, became the eternal. \\nI joined the department of Zhejiang University in 1947. Liberation of Hangzhou, 1949. I added Nino southwest service, and I added the work of liberating the state. In November 1949, I work in the construction of the takeover department, cultural and educational takeover department. At the beginning of April 1950, in the Beijing Central School, my nephephews from the to, I knew that my mother was very good, she greeted the liberation and liberated the department. In 1951, I am the central school,Received a letter from my mother,Letter main,She knows that I work in the provincial committee,She is very high; I told me,inform her to go Lang Dai Yao city and all walks of life people's representatives of all walks of life, but by thou bandits many, Xun law , land reform is underway throughout the province, and I have sent letters to her and the committee. Her letter was mainly to encourage her to abide by the policies and decrees of land reform, and the demands of the people are most likely to be complied with; the letter of the Committee is that the family is a curtailment of the policy. My mother sent a letter to me, and she accepted the agrarian reform arrangement. \\nThis is because I went to Qiannan to engage in land reform, mutual assistance and cooperation, I and my mother were in the line. Until 1956, I went back to the provincial committee, and the young people of the province. One day, suddenly received a letter from the first of the city, the letter was a mother, she was sentenced to sentence, detained at the first, hoping to be able to take my side. I was sent to more than 20 people, including Miao, Buyi, Hui, Yi and other multi-ethnic young people in Qiaozhou, and I was going to Beijing; I had to be born for more than a year by my wife. The woman Anna went to the spotlight. I went back to Beijing, and my wife complained to me, and the mother was very high, and the woman was named Anzhau, to show that my whole family was able to go. \\nIn 1957, I went to see the mother again. By the beginning of 1958, the sheep Ai had a man, and the mother was in the sheep, and needed some food and clothing items. So I went to him some food, some cotton coat and cotton. Then the message was sent, and I don't know whether or not he received it. I have also sent letters to the Sheep Ai Yam, who either did not answer, or inquired about this person. In 1958, I was made to the right and arranged to Zazolin. Just in the Zazolin period, Dagi was in the summer of 1962, suddenly there was a person looking for me. is on the plant site. I think that people are a sister. If it were not for her voice, I would not have lost her. She is a piece more than the big, people thin but very strong young woman, she I don't bother, but also waist, back also, typical is a thin and small old woman, In her defiance, I felt the torture she had suffered in politics and life. She sued me about the situation of my mother being tortured in the early liberation of the soil, and her husband, who was in charge of affairs at my home, was also made. 'Two Landlord' died. She went back to her home of Xiuwen. She knew I was in Zazo, and she looked at me. That is the 'sleepy period', I live a month only 18 yuan, food is quantitative by Lin Yi control. I will help her, and I will send her only one twenty yuan. I went back to the provincial committee, and I went to the Golden Sands to teach her, and then she was again. \\nFor more than a decade, until 1978, my 'right' was corrected and returned to work in the city. In 1980, I entered, once again, the sheep Ai, he officially wrote to me, the mother had died in 1960 in the sheep. \\nMymother's 'sentence' and 'change', I have always had a lot of doubt: what 'sin' she committed, what 'law' did she commit? I found six courts before I knew the root of his sentence: one was a man, the second, the other, the rebellion, and the third was a gangster. My understanding is that the mother is not a man, and that her only child is in the cohort, much less to do that thing. After collecting some information, I filed a complaint with the Provincial High Court. My shin won the support of the provincial high hospital, he made the Shuicheng Central Hospital to check. By 1989, the Liuhuishui City Special People's Court ruled that her mother's sentence was convicted and declared her guilty. The original three people who died her: a person itself is not to do the bandits, was killed by the group in 1950; a person is also a bandits, the people are very large, in 1945 were caught by the group For those who demand death, the group of grandmothers are murdered; one person has a whole lot of people. The matter of the mother and the rebellion, as judged by the former, was the birthday of his nephew's daughter. Friends of the 'anti-' can not be And the haunted banditry is 'mole'. The confession of the original judgment, the name or abduction of the mother himself, is nothing but a copy of the man. People die cannot live. I have to rehabilitate the court documents of the snow, and I can only go at home, and the Zhaoxue documents of the court silently confront the mother, and can only solace the heavens. \\nMother's life, is both ordinary and extraordinary life! \\nThelife of the mother, is the life of the man who pays, and does not ask for the life of the community! \\nMother's life, is a big life! \\nThe return of the mother is the request of the wife and the. I am an old man of 86 years. It is also a 'teaching material' for the children. He is the heart of the weaker and the weak. Innate to the world, and the world. \\nAndrew cong\\nMay 2012"}

The landlord of family origin, I make a living. In 1936, the liberation of the Chinese and Chinese people began to work in 1937. He was appointed the second the first political director, the Communist Party of China (CPC), the Communist Party of China (CPC), The deputy of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, deputy of the Tianjin Municipal People's Procurator's Bureau, the People's Inspection Committee of the Political Affairs Institute of the People's Inspection Committee of the People's Procurator (10). The right molecule. \\nAnru is a mingled into a pier of his own molecule, he is not in the middle of his attack, and in the last ten years. He described the rhetorical rhetoric of the anti-social and anti-social proponents, and used to shelter the anti-revolutionaries. Its main counter-words are as follows:\\nFirst, anti-central, defiance, and attack\\nThe big enlarged period, the social right-wing people contempt for the Gao Dao incident is a clan sectarian, Anru is unconsciously: 'I hung my heart.' It is to replace the method of defiance of the central party. In April 1956, he read the article 'The History of the People's Political Affairs', he attacked the central government not according to the 'chapter', he said: 'The chapter' is very beautiful, but A pity is a stationery, there is a line.' He rebelled his life, in the midst of his life: 'How much? is not a living method, there is a counterproductive, it makes sense to be irrevocable; 'It is too vulgar, and it is not good.' He 'is a lot of eclectic forms, eclectic, eclectic, and close to good.' \\nAn Ru An article, some of the documents in the He did not agree with the analysis of Stalin's work in the document. In the paper, 'The people and the people and the people and the people together pointed out that it is the leap of the road,' is the new one of the central cantons. People Worship. \\nAnru A total of 20 times Dagyu Stalin's approval is not in accordance with the 'chapter'; the Central Committee of the Communist Party has a core, is immature. My private aid is 'no man, heaven and earth'. \\nAnru curse the revolutionary comrades and department are 'human objects', 'human face of the West'. His anti-rhetoric and deeds have been criticized among the anti-right people, and also in the shame: 'I have seen more and more of this year the dense of some people,' to borrow his hatred. The life of the seven or more of his contempt is corrupt, very chaotic, and some of the Gaoqu sections 'the dancers go to Beidaihe for summer summer, and the haunting life of the haunting people.' He is the old part of the 'retread (dance), Li Zicheng's'. He did not dare to hold on the original, he dared not to make a rush to the, 'everything looks at the central eye.' Cheng is 'good for his body', 'Yong Yong Hao', 'only'. \\nSecond, the attack, the political, anti-social reform\\nAnru was in the midst of 1952: 'It is not possible to do the politics of democracy.' The defiance of my is a BAO, made a: 'Beijing West Si Bau Jiu Street representative. Beijing is so, others can think!' In the anti-right, he confessed that there were outsiders among the caveats in the hospital 'is not in line with the policy.' He is defiant at the political level, 'The taste of the cures is very heavy, the people's life is not too hard', 'people's life is difficult', 'the abnormal death in society is very heavy', and 'the darkest' , the most democratic society', 'a place where people are not.' \\nAnru is taking advantage of the legal system to attack the reform. Defiance I take the policy instead of the law, the law can be kept, there is no law to abide by, even the court can not come up with the rule of law is 'to tolerate the law and the freedom of the law', the enterprise is the rule of law Limit the revolution. He is too much, it is a fussy, a mess, is the fruit of 'more', the illusion of 'curbing' to cancel the revolution. \\nHe opposes 'agrarian reform'. He turned out to his landlord's family, and he wanted his family to 'take care of', 'If it was not for me to make a revolution, how could you take the village?' Among the anti-right people, he confesses that he has a blame for the landlord's family, and he has always questioned whether the documents, the cantons, the landlord's domicile, and forcible people are true. Not only did he blame the landlord for 'what bloody sins that squeezed the people,' but he had a 'merit' for his revolution. With his own example, he was able to 'mess up' and revolutionize the revolution, and was the 'merit' of the landlord's family. In 1948, he honored the 'Geoscient' article of the right-wing homelands, until the anti-right people were 'ideological'. \\nHe anti-' three anti' 'five anti'. In the rush to cover the harbouring prisoners; Tianjin unlawfully abused the family stealing workers, and the use of a raincoat case,: 'This first hit on the business and business people,'; The enterprise is using the position of pay for inspection, to arrest the criminal elements, grab his hands, limit the bangs of the unravelling, and he cannot succeed, he will not be able to do so. The Department does not work'. The anti-right faction began, and he gave his statement: 'in the revolution, life is protected', and the right, 'everyone endangers himself,' expressed deep sympathy for the anti-rhetoric of 'everyone endangers himself'. \\nHe was anti-' anti-'. In a great deal, he shouted grievances on behalf of Hu, and the root of his arrest may not be sufficient. So far, there is a public verdict pronouncing, it is not in accordance with the law. Sentencing is comparable. He scorn 'rebellion' wronged the good man, with the rebellion in the rush: 'catch special catch, do not wrong a good person?' \\nHe repudiated cooperation and deeply hated that cooperation 'cannot protect private interests'. In the spring of 1957, he went home in the impressions: 'The death of the dead, words of distress. There is also a living method for those who make the dead, and those who are unhappy. Cotton shining, August 15. The light cut does not fight. in the raw blood does not play a role'. I sent people to check, and some are totally fabricated and distorted. \\nAnru, and the history of the 'anti-traitor' and 'anti-special', 'have been forced to confess many times', 'many false' and 'dead people are very eye-catching'. are sown '', 'must have fruit', total is to 'eat fruit'. \\nThird, harbouring anti-revolutionaries, protecting the family, wronging good people\\nIn 1946, Anru was arrested by the people's government when he appointed his father (the bureaucracy overrides the landlord, who used to attack the people against the people). The use of, shoot, to 'shine' his father (death due to illness insurance). In the same year, his sister, who worked as a sex man, was tortured by the people's government. He died 'very well'. He went to the village to check the matter, went home, and repeatedly looked for the cause of death. Ren. Until the anti-rightist, humiliating me, 'My sister was killed by the bandits.' \\nIn 1952, Anru was the Tianjin Municipal People's Procurator's Office, who used to shelter the rebellion, the rebellion, and the anti-revolutionist Jinfeng (Ann's placket). In the liberation of Tianjin, Tonghua Anzu Chang, mixed into the Tianjin city outside the bureau work. In the 'Three Reverse', the government was arrested by the government for refusing to confess the historical crime, Anru Yun immediately sought the city, the inspection committee, the people who were unhappy, and the wife Chang Yi (rebels), to The Public Prosecutor's Office sued With the signature of Anzac, he asked the court to unleash the Jin Feng and pursue the apprehension of the court. The Foreign Affairs Bureau did not agree to the release, and again, the inspection committee approved and arrested again. , Ann once again, with the signature of the, asked for the release of Jin Feng. Most, even blatantly, the government of the city and the government of the city, from the grass, and the Supreme People's Procurator's Bureau of the Supreme People's Procurator, to stop it. \\nIn 1951, Anru was harbouring Li Qiao (right-wing), a historical anti-revolutionary, who had mixed up with the Tianjin People's Procurator's Bureau. Li has served as the official of Major Yumin Minqu, the 'Directional Society'. In Chacha, Anru also admitted that Li 'has become a counter-revolutionary', but because of fear of Li's feelings, he chased and chased. \\nIn his case of deception against tenants, he not only did not protect the legitimate interests of the tenants, but the anti-tenant law was raised in a case where the director of the Dacheng Hing Hong Kong was deceiving tenants. Public rebellion, resulting in the conviction of four people in one year's imprisonment. Even more absurd is that the tenant Kim Shouquan was a former '' in the name of his brother Jin Shoukun, '' into ''. Anru gave his consent. Yao fruit, 20 young people living, Zun Kuo's identity as '' was raised and convicted. \\nIn 1953, Anru went to Henan to check the wangchuan case, under the name of the Central Comrade, and did not respect the intention of the provincial committee to check the political history of Wangchuan, and was biased. Letter, the Lord, Ding Wang Chuan is framed by beating, and there are sectarian chiefs such as Henan Provincial Committee. He did not clear the truth, and had frustrated some good deeds and good departments, wronged comrade deer, and freed anti-revolutionist Wang Chuan. \\nAnru was born of a landlord family, who received the education of the. The idea of anti-cry is deeply rooted. In the climax of the national resistance against Japan, he became involved in the revolution, but he did not change the backlash. The revolution has committed his own interests, ravaged his family and discarded his woes. He became more hateful and the people, and went into the mud pit of the rightist anti-social rebellion. \\nAnru was criticized in his anti-rhetoric and deeds, and he was defiantly opposed to the group of contempt for his stewardship was 'public', he was 'forced confession', and proclaimed that he was a 'hard bones.' Not afraid. Some of the top ten accusations of the President's defiance have also spoken to the right to speak to themselves. Many times, his degree of haunting, conceding himself is a right-wing, he made seven times, confessed a number of people, examined his thoughts. But the crime of harbouring anti-revolutionaries continues to prevail. Most of all, in the face of a large number of things and ravings, the crime is low. \\nInaddition to their nationality, the root of the foregoing, administrative revocation of the original, supervise, and help in life. \\n16 February 1958\\n PAGE 4"}

He does not want to do that, you will, do not, on the line, let me go, I'm going to go, I, you also have to pay attention to security, and I don't have anything to do with me, I'm afraid you are too trustworthy, easy In the accident, he put his hand on my shoulder, as if he taught me to rest assured, and as if he pushed me to go. , you're afraid, I'm very cautious, walk and full, you forget, I see your day. \\nIV\\n, send me the fourth largest infrastructure to help the harvest, each small fraction in different lots of finished a plot, put the bundle of valleys back to the road, waiting for the Pull, and then move to the next area, the road is a pier, the ridge is a pier, fill the canals,, the land becomes a road valley pull away, then it is the original, the road becomes the land, the land. , harvest more, is easy, than the flat dig row more, but early touch black, plus, also very tired, Razuhr whistle, people sit down in place, snooze. \\nThat day was snooze, suddenly singing, is the 'song', the sound is low and thick, as the ground, Xu and wrestling:\\nCavity-\\nBlood has boiled\\nOnce you know, it is an Zhaojun, I sat on a bones, sat down on the ground, stopped, beside the wicked and sat many people, we finished drinking The bucket of water, just under the ground, I walked, looked back to the crowd, supported the upper body, lying on the slope, and then approached, and looked at his eyes. It is a revolutionary song, people are more than heart, are just the ears. \\nLook at me, he touched his mouth with his index finger, signaled, photographed the ground, I sat down next to him, put a hand on my hand, I was silent. Sat, nothing, heavenly and earth,,,,, western slandering autumn Blown the rag garbage, light gray flat, straight, that, there is a sense of being buried alive, also want to sing a song, but I sing. \\nHe is a valley, Valley Zi land, if not too late to pull away, he was blown away, his lap slept on the, playing a yawn, squatting to me, pocket out bags and small pieces, starting to roll one side, eat this evening mess paste, add potato. \\nEat what is the important new every day, the eternal man is happy, he is also delighted, roll a good, touch the arm with his fingers,,,, An zhaojun back On the shoulder, pick up, the person rolls a good one, their mouth, out a piece of the circle, squint eyes look at the day. \\nDay, is a large blank. \\nThewhistle of the laborer was caught, Antang took a moment, still, it was strong, that little shaking, I felt once again, a fierce flow, that hands were all over. My whole body. \\nAnd I will come to him again. \\nFive\\nAtthe beginning of March 1959, I was the police of the province's public security, and I went to the 'Ten Years of Achievement Exhibition' in Qianzhou, and finished back, but a year. Period, because of too many dead people, have been dazzling, 'home' can I, was sent to another one--Jingqu River. \\nIn the summer of 1961, a group of people was pumped out by the Ganzan Provincial Bureau of the Reform Bureau, and went to me to help the summer harvest. Among them, there was a lucky surviving person called 'Wenqu'. Formerly liberated, to fight the war, to stand up, to the public security. In 1957, the call of the, the big magnification, the batch is 'tiger whip on the sheep', so it was sent to the right wing, I know An zhaojun Siu Junis dead. \\nHe did not know what it was to think about it. The people who died every day were going to get a little more than one minute, sending more than 1,000 people to Gaotai Mingshui. Only less than half of the people, the amount has doubled, with the mouth, less than half, originally set a day 12 city, only 7 city, on the eat on the Lives! no matter, autumn crop have closed, all by you lying on the kang, buried people every day to pull the plate of the compound circle, which is dead people, pulled out of the, he Go, nothing, instead of using the big. \\nWhere is he An zhaojun Siu-jun? If he is in the bright water, die faster, he, the family is very curtailed, has not done, to wipe the comb every day, dip a cup and drink the water, just wipe, dip, wait for people Hands down the belly, he wants to find a place to sit down and eat, no matter what a spoonful of water, are a spoonful of the manoeuvres, people are lying on the kang. He does not go into darkness, and in the outside the ground, sit on his back and watch the sky, and there is a waiting man to sing a song, babbling, he does not know what to sing, he is a sat to death. \\nWhere is the man buried? He, buried? powerful digging pit! Pull out, in the field. \\nSince December 1960, sent a job, began rescue and repatriation work. Then, there was no more than a thousand and one hundred people. Repatriation is also not easy, many people have been left out of their homes, many people have been removed from the public, and received, beating it up, and in October 1961, retreated for another year. \\nVI\\n20 years ago, 1978 the right was 'rehabilitated', rehabilitated, rehabilitated work, called '', I went to the, I went to the Dajiangzhe department to teach, one to Qianzhou, went to a fourth junior high school, an's wife Rong, she had been married in 1965, children, unknown, she had gone to find an Zhaojun in 1962, to Jiuquan to know ,. \\nAt the end of 1978, I was borrowed to work at the Institute of Zhe Research Institute in Beijing, and in that three years, I was experiencing the climax of a group of people from all over the world. Victims of grievances and falsification cases, in the public security department and other ministries, 'group of people', under the window of chess and the general small window, hoping to get a pity. The fair and positive, which has a lucky surviving person, called Zhan Jianyuan, was originally the workers of the new printing, wearing a 'molecule' hat, 1957 anti-right, there is a policy: There are right-wing speakers among workers who are not called the right-wing, called 'molecules' (because the workers are revolutionary and rightist). He has a pinch, but the hats of the men are not among the workers. On the right, there are men and women in the society who do nothing, fights, thieves, are all called the 'rush', the right-wing rehabilitating, the rehabilitating of the right. Suo Yun, to Beijing to seek justice. \\nHowever, his material, still got back to the original position, I was in the Academy of Social Sciences, asked me to talk about the method, in a small group of people under the Huhu, I got it. For a long time, he was repatriated from work. He was deported from his work, and the dead were very close, and the most dead people, including Ana Siu Jun, were in front of the Dacheng. 200 meters below the first sandy. \\nIn 1982, I returned to Jiaozhou, and one day, my colleagues in the department, Taught the history of Zi Bin (also the right wing, 'old man'), ran away. , he wants to resist, fight the Ganqian Provincial Committee approved the dig of the complete human bones, do and teach utensils. The matter is secret, but the people of the hospital answered in advance. The people are paid according to their workers, and they do not have to excavate, but only under the first sand in front of the Dagyu a day, they got too much to ask for correction and change to pay according to the pay. And the people of the people, he is a man, and he is a man, and he fought, and he will be public. To the old ears, however, the anti-can not afford, the thing, people have fun. \\nIt is likely that the skeleton face, there is an Zhaojun, but the face tired bones, and can be fainted, hero slave, martyr, old man, That guy? Even if it is an unbounded gene archaeological family, how can you know, which skeletal surface has been 'the blood of the cavity has boiled'? Even more, has long been,Some people want to know。 \\nSen Mori white bone with a tomb, was forgotten by people, blown sungrass in the wilderness, by the usefulness of the, was remembered, Soaking water, pochmark refers to, this general rhyme. \\nAll of a sudden, the history of blood and fire have retreated to the horizon, annihilation in the shadow of the forgotten, and those who have so far lost me, drain me, I firmly hold and Everything you try to get right, but also seems to be oblivious, have turned into some unrudible pictograms, also have fun to figure it out. \\nTheonly one that left behind me is a star and a half in the fierce rush: his boss, his boss, his handshake, his cold shadow, his eyes, and the loneliness. Song, he has his site fast-the chase of the willing, that to the will of zero to pick. \\nFrom the there is some! I understood the word 'Zu' in a full range of lonely people, and I felt that it was and the family of people of culture, no matter how thin it was. Even imagined objects, it is all about survival. \\nAn eye for more than 40 years, I do not know where he is, Antai and Anshi? Do you get his father? If there is an accident, he is forty, and I bless him deeply! But he can know that his father is a true man worthy of his pride. \\nPAGE \\nPAGE 6"}

Japanese Kou surrender. Do you want to get into the north? The people of the North caused a deep concern, and the United States, whose name is to help China and liberate the people of the North. It's really unknowingly abhorrent. I am a child, to the work of the, left a deep impression in my heart and hate. I also set the life of my life, in a total of the best of my life 17 years. \\nIn the Shenghuan municipal insurance, the Jiayu, I Xie, some of them are prisoners. During the period, he proposed to protect the family, the government answered His request is only a matter of criminal law. \\nIs it really like the one? So what is the whole place of the north and the great places, whoever goes to the rampant, is an officer or a soldier, and prostitutes, and does not do it. How can it be? \\nIt is afraid of the people who use the apparatus to create artillery and slaughter people. That first, rare to Japan to fall device? and; 'buried all those apparatus, and they were in the midst.' is really a rhetoric! \\nSo what is it? All things such as cattle and sheep in the middle of the day, with fire, and what? How high is some people in the middle and the outside people, some people? The woes caused by the people of the North are really 'exhaustive' and are unabated. \\nThevillage I live in is a natural village, in the northwest suburbs of Shenghuan city, there are more than 100 people. I am not fortunate to be spared in the village. The wife of Wang × (named Wang Qianan, whose name is still living in situ, and his children's real name), was caught by the officer, dragged to the empty house, and the soldiers stood outside. Twelve young girls were also raped. A woman whose family has been torn, is too humiliated by the matter, and the family can not be outspoken, nor will it be. People are not known. \\nThe Japanese take the people in the middle, and the people in the same way as the cattle are not as good as the slaughter people. In the northwest direction of Shen Yao City, there is a Japanese, called 581, the noodle contains the Japanese invaders all over the plunge. In the place, the death of the people on the death of the people. It is the Japanese who plunges the West of the middle people, nor is it that you have a bouncy of the family, do you want to make a lot of people? You are not in the hands of the people to take their own cousins, and do you turn into fire every day to you, to help, or be in the midst of aggression? People who die in the middle, Shen Qiao all know that the is not a scorn, nor is it the contempt of the scorn, it is something that exists. \\nIn my village, you know the people! Xu Ji lives in the village. One morning, he wants to be cheaper. In the northwest suburbs of Shen Yao, there is a Japanese called '581', Japan surrendered, social order, some people '581' products, such as shoes, sweaters, futons, etc. . Xu Ji in the village west of the village Liuzhi station , Shiguku Shin was gone. Xu Jiji is distressed, standing under the willow. No one, which is to find a soldier and find a soldier, the previous one with a finger Xu Qiuji, meaning he back to the, he is not remiss. Before you come up, to Xu Jiji smashed, the Xu Ji hit that called the whole village. That I was 10, the horror of my heart was going to jump out of my heart, very scared and very hated. There was a man in the village who dared to pull forward (rescue), and his family did not dare. There has been a half a small sound, big nose soldiers and go, the talent of the village dare to go, Xu Qiji has been beaten bloody and flesh, has long been dead. \\nIt was in broad daylight, also went away, and people were killed alive, that is the 'huge aid' of the (total), of the Churatsua's office. \\nIn the northern suburbs of Shen Dao, there is a to the west of the river, people in Shenghu city call it Bei Qianhe, that all call it two Dao, I'm under the Kanzi village people call it Shaheyan, winter The river is also on ice during the dry period, and people close to the ice. In the winter of 1945, there was a Dagu road, near my village, the old man, sat the old girl. Tucked a pier officer, the girl was raped, to finish the job to grill the tires. The old cry crying: 'My girl is spoiled, steeped, can go? How come home? I have suffered 14 years of small Japan, and I was also affected by the, more than Japan's howling, the traitor girl, and the police did not dare to take care of...' It happened that the police came to the roadside, Ben I didn't want or dare to control it, but the old man cried. One of the police called Xu Jingi provoked the crying, and then went out, as the officer's leg was hit. Sitting on the ground, you can't stop clapping. Another policeman Yuqing: 'Where can you go? It's so hateful!' And then the officer died. He is also the subordination of his deeds, it is sinful, and it is a great pleasure. However, in 1952, the two men of Xu Jingi and Zu Yuqing were pulled out and pulled to the big platform in the field of my village. There was a big sign of 'prisoner' on his neck. To criticize the, the people are going back in again. (May 2010)\\n[ Note: Ai qingshan, born in 1934 under the Kanzi, liberated into Shen 112 (manufacturing), workers.

To see the words of the rehabilitative, 552,877 people are only 5,000 people who are 'real' right, 0.09%, and by 'Dahua' hit people, More than 99%. There are also people who have picked the right hat so far, only Qiao Bo, Anping, Lin Xiling, and so on; while the official announcement of the right, more than 55 people, are not correct, and have been 'controlled by the right'. ', is likely to be more than 100. If this is true, then the people who 'Dahua' are more than 99.99%. \\nHowever, among the more than 55 people of the right, not everyone can wait until the ordinary day. Many of them died before rehabilitation. And among them are sick, of the tired, and the dead, and many of them die by themselves. \\nAnd in that year, there were many people who had themselves. I was much more uncomfortable, some weird, numbness. But there is a person's self, I left a special impression, eternal forget. The people called Ao Nai. \\nIn the summer of 1962, the right-wing elements who were sent to the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, were mostly concentrated on the outskirts of Beijing. People, in the 'three' in the 'three' to build a teacher, waiting for the arrangement of management. \\n' Three years of natural damage' of people who die every day, live under the 'three years of death' in each other's rightists. It is with the shelves, such as the tiannian; has been sent to the Taiping, it will be buried, and actually surprisingly live, such as Hong. With him, 'I have come to the front of the 'ghost', but the king refused to receive it, but to return to the unfinished sins!' The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau is a better than one of the people living in the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau. It is a great favor to send some rightists to the people who have taught them. Everyone understands that if the central government has a policy of '', the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau will not have the right elements so 'wrestling'. \\nHowever, 'there is no more irregularity', and the 'center-tribulation system' is not only the return of right-wing elements to work and establish a high degree, even a three-year period of teaching. Nor is it announced to be dissolved. It was a boiling heart all over the ice cellar, and it suddenly got up. \\nBy looking at the future and the way out, the rightists concentrated on the hee degree of sentiment is low. In 1964, the frenzy night of the, the original Beijing Dao The brave gulf of the North Sea jumped up, and made the precedent of the right 'from the people' of the 'people' of the river. Rabbit dead fox sad, lack of self-brave 'with' dark fall, I do not know how he died his day. \\nIn 1966, some right-wing elements, who had transformed for nearly a decade, not only did not want to return to their position, but suddenly broke the 'left' thought tide by the unprecedented 'Cultural Revolution' It is also rampant in the river, and the supervisors of the right-wing elements have been unleashed, but rather, it is a 'dissipation of resistance' incident that was the second 'anti-resistance' of the right. \\nThing is caused by 'big copy'. \\n' Three' concentrated 100 right-wing wing, is the whole 'highest level of culture'. However, the level of management of the police is mostly low, and the educated right is disproportionate. Special is the 'outsider' of the right, the management of the police also. For some days, the police will all know that some right-wing elements will soon return to their position. What is doing is the policy of 'management', putting the main force on improving life, only hoping that some skinny bones are like wood. The 'live skeleton' quickly regained power, and get out of the public security bureau. \\nThere are three more than the 'living' of the right: see more, more of the work, and more. The right-wing luggage is not big, the box is very heavy, it is the most obvious thing to be a very different referee. Every week and holidays, 'three' some hold most of the, see the ancient and modern Chinese and foreign literature famous, many people see the original version; some people singing, small, Chinese or foreign writings; some People gathered together in groups of nonchatters, astronomy, geography,, history not involved. Some 'cultural activities', the censorship is not stopped, because it may not be possible to reform, nor to provoke it, and then, even if you want to make a difference, it is also the level. \\nInto the 'Cultural Revolution', great emotion: first of all, the group of correctional departments of the original 'people' were too kindly and 'revolutionist' left, a group of unknown Tenkochi thick and pretentious 'fist', 'government'. The second is the disintegration and disintegration of 'fixing', 'right to the right' policy, which divides the right and divides the right, and the 'anti-transformation molecule', and 'mid' molecules, and rely on 'molecules'. Take 'middle molecules' and isolate a handful of 'anti-transformation molecules'. The deployment of the first round, is to copy the right wing of what is all looking at, but also with the gao rong, pulling out the typical people, criticizing. \\nA 'small', the first one is Ao naisong. \\nChapter II, 'anti-' with\\nThere are a lot of people, there are many people who turn over Bazak, there are studies of ancient and dialect, there are, there are, The pretentious madman in the 'family revolution'. Many people's masterpiece 'all public' sex, not confidential, look at it; only Ao no is not secret, but in addition to the person who knows, in general, is not willing to people look at. 'molecule' up, is 'pear' on him, to see what he is. \\nThere are no trees in the world. Some deployment of the part, naturally, there are 'molecules' revealed, is the hands of some foreign language or small people, to avoid 'not clear', all secretly hide. He was buried in a plastic cloth with four of his 'sad world' on the night. But Ao Nai's biased unbelieving, he also has a measure of the his own work is a big bright, unthinkable, not only do not want to hide the, I do not want to do it. Do not. \\nOne day, we all went down to live in the waiting area, Mabe left behind the 'molecules', in each dormitory turned the box, a big search, Ao Nai Hou's , Part searched away. \\nWe return to work, quilt quilt, the burden was dissolved, the box was pry, in addition to the hairs, and the words, books, mostly unwittingly, The heart is very unhappy, but also nothing. Only Ao Nai, he ran to his own boss, and he ran to his own boss to ask for a solemn. The practice is tantamount to the tiger, the change, which is possible? It was the night, Ao Nai quietly hanged himself. \\nFortunately by the middle of the night to solve his hands, saved the next, this section sent people to see him day and night, not only seek death, to accept criticism: a batch of ' The two batches of 'resistance to transformation, people'. \\nWell, what is Ao Nai? It is worth his life as a sacrifice, and what is it that he has to do with him? \\nI was concentrated in the summer of 1962, and Ao naisong was only in 1965. I and he used not to talk, and he was not in one, only know that there is a lot of people, flat silence, not much, 'with the window' not much, take work home every day, do not work, do not Thing. Until his manuscript was searched and he was criticizing, I was only told in the mouth of the 'critic' that he was in a 'little love' of a 'butterflies'. And his answer, only 'are all things, don't believe you can go to check' a sentence. 'Criticism' is mainly the 'blame of fighting anti-transformation elements', and it is impossible for anyone to really go to the outside, and it is that 'criticized' is the 'critique' of the 'crusade'. Ao Nai's 'anti-transformation' will not be gone. \\nAo naisong and I really got acquainted with him. He was in three years of his criticism. In the winter of 1968, the 'five seven school', all people including police, inmates, teaching people, young workers moved to the north of Tianjin Qinghe. I am a right-wing religious triumpher. Three points have one grape, one peach, one fruit. In the summer and autumn of 1969, I was assigned to guard the grapes, and Ao naisong was assigned to guard the peach. Not apart, I often pray to each other, the 'good goods' guarded by each other. Ao Nai good sound, singing, singing, singing, singing; I also good music, lala violin, coupled with me The degree of indifference. Through the many times the intersection of Didi, I his life and the '', only to understand. \\nThe third chapter, Lang Cai girl, born a\\nAo Nai Yee is my famous film artist, Mr. Ao Ao Hung Lao.

Ao Nai by the family's shadow, Xiao good Wen, classical deep, better sound. \\nIn 1955, Ao Nai Beijing daemun, that is, the assignment of work, the awaited, suddenly suffers from lung nucleus, and is already in the medium term. His father is old, and his mother has a sick and old bed, he will rely on his father to look, now he is also sick, the mother is not able to increase the father's pity, the bargain fruit, but to shen Allocation, go back to Changzhou's grandmother's home to go to the rest. \\nHis grandmother's family is in Changzhou, there is an old-fashioned wooden house, it is not very good, open and comfortable, he is waiting for him. Changzhou is a beautiful and rich rice, his grandmother's house is a small river, often in front of the sails slowly shifting, clear river water,; beside the house has peach plum fruit, Tranquil, is a good way to go to the disease. The old grandmother is old, but it is very healthy, and very hard, she has to eat the eggs every day, and he often gets to drink, plus a little nephew to catch, and often have a beautiful live drink. You can live very comfortable. In that month, lung nucleus was not incurable disease, one side has Remi seal, P.A.S., the special effects of his grandmother's care, his body is good day by day. \\nLife is not to go for a walk in the morning and evening, at home during the day, and occasionally chat with aunt cousin, the days do not beat. \\nIn front of his house, is a road leading to the village, every morning and midnight, he can see a group of naive small hip-hop in front of his window hip-hop, jumping bouncing Go. Little boom, generally only 89, ten years, but he is in the group of children, a girl with 15 or six, clearly more than his children, there is really a 'rally' . She is a small boom, the age seems to be too big, she is an old man, the age seems too small, he her companions walk together, also can not be seen in the words of the old man. She loudly loudly, her voice was sweet, and she looked at the window. By the love of special, Ao Nai inevitably pay more attention to her,, he does not have to see, sound, you can judge the girl is not in the group of children. \\nOnce he is on the window to see the girl, Grandma is just going to go, he's grandmother: How do you get a girl and a group of dolls together? Grandma told him: The girl named Lei Lei Lei, this year 16 years, her father is a grandmother's nephew, counting, with Ao family also, can be considered a cousin. In her three years of waiting, because her mother was sick, the family had to rely on her 'female' support, had to get her younger brother on a pussy, a long delay, then delayed a good year. Nowadays the mother's disease is good,, fruit sister than his brother's class is lower than his brother, no more. And her father, who was to turn back to the disease, was seeking him to help him for his mercy. Nai, remembering his grandmother's home waiting, is a very small girl often go to play, I think that a shaking is big, can't get out, laughing out of the grandmother, he wants to see Is it worth creating a little girl. \\nThe next day, Grandma actually took the lei rai. She got a little bit, like the early life of the old man, with standing, first bowed a 90 degree bow, heavenly: 'Ao Lao, I'm stupid, you my old man, can be born to my Yah!' Ao Nai Laughing: 'I called me Ao old man, I am not your cousin? You call me the sea brother when you are young, call me the sea brother!' He is the small name of Ao Nai, and the people of the earth call him, and few call him Ao Nai. \\nNoodles close up, he Lei Lei is a beautiful girl. She is true, sweet, kind, clear, sensible, with all the girls of the family and the girl under any vulgar words. She eyebrow eyes, like peach blossoms, facial features and shows, a laughing wine, thick and black. Her life was very shy, a word of answer, a, sat down,,,, only hands on the knee, the waist rod was very straight, a pair of uneasiness, but still Can not cover her beauty in the natural, and it is very clear, not low energy. \\nThegirl, Ao Nai Yao is very interested in her, answer, set out what is waiting for every day, what are the qualities. Grandma laughed: 'Oh, you can make her work up, you will have merit! No, you also have to pay attention not to get tired of yourself!' He was the beginning of the day, and Lei Lei became his boss, and every day he went to him. \\n' Do not get tired of yourself', Gui Ming Lei Lei, Grandma, guess that is sick. Or it may also be that her father is going home to the disease. It is a little familiar with some of the eagus, and Lei Lei suddenly got out of what kind of disease, but he did not bother her, he was suffering from the lung nucleus. A girl, which knows what is called the lung nucleus? Wait until she understood that she broke her eyes, and she was afraid: 'Is it a disease?' And she was sick, and she was dead. Wait until she is clear: the disease is not an incurable disease, has a special effect, not dead people, she jumped up, really can talk about God, overflowing words. In this, she often sabotted eggs and new vegetables. Nai knows that her home is bad, with her brother and her two people, euphemism. Yes, she went down to touch the river, did it, sent to him. \\nA big boom, a little bit of life, Ran is not to blow ash, Lei Lei's work, soon on the same class. Noodles, Ran also have their own efforts. She was done according to her work, and she had fallen once, and she was not. He is going to wrestle her intellect, using her knowledge and understanding of people, to get back all the lost woes, and the level of knowledge that she has in the same year. For half a year, the work and knowledge of Lei Lei have a great deal. She not only talked to her brother with the sea, singing and singing, and, he borrowed a large number of small people. But her kind heart cannot understand what evil is. She does not understand that the Japanese people make a lot of people, what to send troops to attack in the middle, but also the people are fierce; she does not understand Cinderella's sister to be jealous about her marrying the prince. In her mind, all the people in the world are like her parents, all like the heavenly and talented, like a grandmother and kind. It is her sea brother, who has a golden eye, is not a beautiful man, but he is the heavenly and earth, unaware, nothing, is the most abusive of her people. She hated all the things she wanted, and she knew that she taught her everything she wanted. \\nAnother half a year, she became fascinated, but he can borrow her, have to go to the city. \\nOne day, Lei Lei finished reading the '·', very loving love: 'I really admire, she dares to go to Chester.' 'Also admire Chester, he dare to accept.' Lei Lei against him: 'If you are Chester, do you accept the?' Nobu: 'I am unhappy. If you are, you have the courage to go to Chester?' And Leirai answered, and he answered him with a kiss. \\nOne year, Lei Lei's knowledge, youth, love is quietly in the bottom of the heart, mature. That year, Lei Lei 17, was 22. \\nNai Shun sued his grandmother about the things he had to do with. Grandma Ben was very happy and expressed his full support. Grandma went to his parents to raise the curse, and he was unwilling to ask for it, and answer. Having obtained the fangs of the family, he will make things semi-public. The next step will only wait for Beijing to get the consent of the Beijing side to legalize the matter. \\nAt the beginning of 1957, Nai Yao had been in Changzhou for a whole year, and his lungs were recovered from the hospital in Changzhou. It happened that he was waiting for his father to return home, because his distribution had been postponed for a year and could not be delayed anymore. He will return to Beijing, on the one hand to accept assignments, while also legalizing marriage. \\nInChangzhou, one night, Lei Lei Yao Nai Yao finished the luggage, just in the room of Nai. People close to each other, crying and laughing, parting, unfinished mountain alliance oath, unshakable love. Leirai hugged her elder brother, and in his ears the lowlands. She was able to get a good husband like him, it was her blessing, and she felt very, very happy. But she felt happy again as if it was, once she woke up, everything was empty. She feels that today's distraction is his permanent. He is unbelieving, his parents are all known, do not turn back on his marriage, waiting for him, must be a happy life, the future. \\nAll night, the people also slept, the whole night of love, their hearts boiling blood all out. Dawn, Lei Lei sent to the road, she took out a piece of hand made, 'sea' word cloth bag, egg and branding, there is a girl fire and red heart...\\nAo Nai Yao returned to Beijing, the first thing is to give his parents a little more than a year to their parents. The mother is looking at the lush, know her beauty, kindness and diligence, beating her little will be very happy with her, since the son himself has her, has any meaning. Father Lei, the culture level difference is too different. Nai: culture is the West of the day, can be euphoria, He Leirai, the ability to accept the knowledge of the, is a white, can be the latest and most beautiful. The mother is married with the heart of her heart. Nai: Under the 'Law', citizens have freedom of movement. If the government actually does not allow legal couples to live together, what is the people's government? Again, if the mouth is not, he will notice that Changzhou goes to work, even if the village teaches. Father degree so, it will no longer be counterproductive. In the evening, Nai Yun with a very happy mood and a happy letter, she told her parents who had already been unfortunate, his marriage, at least in the family has been legalized, can also He was officially married, and she was most waiting for her to obtain a legal commitment. \\nIt is a good thing to receive. The first thing is to go to the police station: the wife's family is in Changzhou's village, is it not allowed to get away from Beijing. The answer from the police is: As long as there is a marriage and a place, the family will allow the female party to get away. The second is the school to get the department, by the school, and put his work in the capital. \\nThecapital is in the Yonghegu Noodles, houses are the ancient building of the Qing Dynasty, the place is open, quiet, is a good way to go. Ao Nai lung disease healed, work, wife can heart, really three joy, hesitation, one. At the beginning of his work, no heavy work, work is not busy, he sat in the office of a cover a letter, his spring happy, his mood is happy, his work dilemma, Life, the days are sweeter than honey. Leilei is the first time to love, but out of her true, letter to the life, she longing for a happy life, how her husband cares to eat and live, how to make a haunting effort , in order to get a job, she even 10 years and 8 years, the thing of not having children was tested. \\nIf there is a sudden earthquake, his marriage must be beautiful, life is happy, and the future will certainly be bright. \\nThe fourth chapter, the Ten Quake Earthquake Really\\nHowever, the 10 earthquakes that did not make a mistake, they did not move to the ground with the lord of the people. Zu 960 square of the land of the land, turned over, 55 know the people of the, that year was forgotten in the history of 1957, Ao Nai A young man who went to work to work, but out of his devotion and his fidelity, the people mentioned the intention to change the work of his own, and he was caught up with a 'anti-' Big hat, the right, waiting for the grasp. \\nAo Nai first was the spring, flat step, pick up a pier,, and half a day in a pussy with a torn of 18. The sudden uplift, so that he was sober and awake in the sorghum. He did not pay much attention to politics, he also knew that politics was horrible. He knew that he had a great deal of political manoeuvres, he could not get a solution, and had a future of his own again. Sick in bed of old mother, father and brother shining, naive and evil buds, years too old, too tender, unaware of heaven and earth thick, not knowing the bumpy of the journey of life. If she sails, she is not going to sail with her boat, now it is misfortune to fall into the water, suffer, and nothing can pull her down the water, and he will not be able to pull her out of the water. The pain is painful. He has a letter, saying that she has been caught up by right-wing elements, and has a future in politics, and goes anywhere today. Not known. Therefore, he cannot bother her, not harm her, and can't get her blossoming buds in the middle of the storm, and a thousand sentences, that is: everything that has been left has been fooled. This life and the world, like the old pier, the haiqu, but the relationship can only stop here, now can only be her sea brother, can no longer be her husband. He drummed her hard work, seeking a piece of her work, and looking for another piece of cooperation like...\\nBut the letter, a girl who is only 17 and a half, is how much understanding is it! First of all, she doesn't know what to call the 'right', let alone what 'political future' is called. She only knows that she wants to take everything to the best man in the world, but she is not asking her anymore. Shan Menghai oath, vowed in the ear, but once he returned to Beijing, with a job, he could not see her young and young people, and he was a young girl in the village. The thing that she was most interested in on the night was indeed down to her. She was crying, and she had a letter of love and concern to her heart, and looked forward to him not. Even if there is really anything to suffer, she also relentlessly with him, Paul will never heed, never repent. \\nReceived the letter, Ao Nai Yee really ridiculous. His little god is too childish to blame her own lack of understanding. He again wrote her a letter, saying that everything could be called the right: with the rush, the right is the anti-revolution, and the anti-revolutionaries are treated in the village. Is aware, understand. There is a political future, and the future is that we can no longer work in the capital. Today, it is likely to go to the village or to work for the work. Therefore, he could not be tired of a woman like a transparent crystal glass like a sinful together, together at the very bottom of the society, so that he died at the bottom of the society. \\nTheletter came out, and soon got a reply from Lei Lei. She: As long as her brother is not looking for a borrow to get her, she is not afraid of anti-revolutionaries. Her most intriguing thing is one in Beijing, one in the village, can not live together. Since there is a future is lost work in the city, then she greeted the sea brother back to the village, and people together, self-reliant, and the world. She has a controlled counter-revolution in her village. As long as the old man is not guilty of doing anything wrong, they go down to the land and make a rush out of the New Year, and the people of the village do not disagree with him. He made things clear, she was set to go to Beijing immediately, and before he was called upon. \\nAfter reading the letter, to. Ao Nai Yao really admire the pain of the girl. Look, she was eating a weigh and her heart, did not get the sea brother, was dead and refused to go back. \\nThe day afternoon is to the front of the fire station to the Lei Lei Lei to pick up the back. To the small in March, Lei Lei first laughing, is crying. No matter what it is, she has only one sentence: As long as she is unhappy, she will always talk to him, even if he or a prisoner. She expressed her heart, she asked to marry immediately, and also: as long as people are together, drinking water is also sweet, eat porridge is also fragrant. \\nHer degree is so much, the family is very feeling. However, according to the marriage law, the woman also takes 18 weeks to get married. She is only 17 and a half, and she is only 17 and a half. Moreover, he, Ao Nai Yee, has been killed by right-wing elements. He is waiting for his treatment, and it does not know exactly what kind of reasoning. According to the best estimate, it is to devolve, go to the field or work, according to the most estimate, that is to remove the public and send to teach. On the bones of the bones and eyes to propose to marry, even if the woman is qualified in the year, it is not appropriate. \\nSince the woman's degree is so devoid, under special circumstances, the old lady made a special decision: no time, crunchy not to go, the marriage again, no notice. A family hiding, laughing, rushing food and wine, a wedding party, a lot of bitterness-this scene, really 'lumpimps blowing'. \\nMr. Ao Onhonglao works in the 'Zhongyao' society and lives in the dormitory of the Ministry of Culture in Fucheng. \\nThe house was demolished long ago. It's an old-fashioned residence with a staircase outside. Not Ao home is a set of three bedrooms, in the housing is generally narrow, the face is big. 3 room, the old mouth of the old, not slippery, 4 pieces together live one of the largest, little babysitter live one of the smallest. Since it is married to a bride, even if it is very rushed, very hasty, can't the bride get in the place? is the old lady little babysitter to discuss, little babysitter in the customer's sand on the night, her small house, is a new house. Ao Nai 'to sin' waiting for 'care' at home, the honeymoon period of the newlywed Yan Yan, has a heavenly. The most intention he did, was not to send him to teach. However, the 'Case of Testimonials' published by the President of the Root Family on August 1, was not 'the highest administrative division', and it was not too much, as long as there was a rally, and the table was better. , I picked the right hat, back to work again. Therefore, the sense of fear of his people is not very fierce, which makes him heartless, it is just like a lacquered swallowed new marriage, a little bit! \\nTheheavenly, a does not want it to go to the noodle,. A small jeep, to stop in front of the dormitory, the police, called the house of Ao's house, took out a with the Beijing Municipal People's Government's big print of 'notice', to Ao Nai. \\nEverything is in the middle of the material, so the whole family is panicking. Ao Nai's words were self-righteous. His parents, wives and younger brothers complained to him, carried the luggage and toiletry under his family long ago, and stepped out of the house under police escort. The sadness of the, the pier has a sense of sorrow, but it is a very disgraceful thing, so Ao Nai Yao is first with home, once out of the incident in the material, the whole family The first is to pity, do not panic, do not cry; the second is not to send off, only to go to another place to work. Now that things are 'unfortunate' today, all people at home can control themselves. Leilei Dao's waiting, piercing her eyes are overflowing, but biting the mouth, there is a work, the table is very. She seemed to want to hold her husband, but a hand was caught by her mother's death, and she could only send her husband out with eyes. \\nAo Nai out of the house, walked down a ladder, walked to the corner of the two ladder, suddenly, on a torn heart-lung call: 'Brother sea, you have to take care of ah !' Ao Nai, only the rai lei stood in the corner of the three ladder, dispersed, the flow of the surface, clearly was the control of the rebellion and the rebellion. At a glance, it is Ao Nai's lifetime to see Lei Lei's most glance. He dare no longer see, nor can he bear to see This scenario, is the, the stone heart, also do not want to rush, unraveled. He knows that as long as he shouted her, even as long as he shouted her for a little doubt, Lei Lei would definitely get down. To avoid a laughing scene, Ao Nai made himself with the largest self-made force, just looked back at her, glanced at her, fiercely raised the heart, raised the, speeding up the pace down the ladder , I fear too little jeep. \\nHe looked at Lei Lei, until he had a glance. He was afraid to see unexpected scenarios, he could not control himself. \\nIn 1966, it was a 'historical history' that was copied in Santo. As a small piece, very fluttering, very lively, not like my's rough and clumsy. To the story of teaching, may not be able to reach, or do not know how to get away, the manuscript has been torn, and he was 'sinned' in his case bag. \\nThe fifth chapter, Lei Lei is the village\\nIn front, all people, including the head of the committee, who sent Ao Nai Yao, are not thinking of the right-wing elements who 'I contradict and act as contradictions for the people.' Actually, the Public Security Bureau is like mud cattle into the sea, have to go back. Ao Nai is also with all the rightists who have been divided and repented, and really intend to be a man again in the howl. He is the base of lung disease, and he is suffering from anal anal disease, and he will be sick. It can be imagined that, like his weaker and weaker people, have to get a little bit, and how difficult it is. \\nTheyoung people who have been taught today are also very much imagined how they live and how the rightists who have been reformed in the years. Near, I went to the Beijing city of the teaching center,, teach people to sleep is a bed, eat rice, white noodles, room, fan, dressed well, teach Period to allow a marriage, Yun Yun college entrance examination, wearing slippers to work, to the site is also Yang Yang, a pair of lingering people, compared to the 50's teaching house, has been a paradise, . The 50's teaching house, eat is noodles, and can only eat half a lot, bed stink, stink, stunned, one to sleep twenty or thirty people, one person only 30 rice, body Clothes broken, than the flowers are not as good as, even less as a prisoner! It is a group of unhealthy food, clothing, many people are gao kn"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "ow the molecules, live up, to be 400 kilos of soil, one day to do ten square earthwork! \\n, Ao Nai to transform himself, return to the position, the lust of the Lord, biting teeth to overcome all the difficulties, in the table is outstanding. During this period, he has always kept his letter. Lei Lei adheres to his words and is unswervingly patiently waiting for the peace of her husband. It is for a period of time. It is 'makeover', but from late autumn 57 to the early summer of 62, it went for five years, reinventing the right-wing elements for four or five years. You can also 'transform good', because of a matter to lift the teaching, return to the position of people also have. \\nUntil May 24, 1961, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau summoned the Dacheng in the subordination of the teaching staff, and every divine cult announced the teaching period: the shortest half a year. The most three years; but there is a note: the previous days are not counted, all count from May 24, 1961. The teaching period was announced, the people under the table were disguised: four or five years, it was not easy, whether it was not counted, what is the truth? The government is legal? However, in the years when the rule of law is not sound, 'I am the law', everything is a man to count. Regardless of the intent to make a mistake, it can only be done, nor can it be changed. \\nAo Nai is not guilty and is regularly eaten for 3 years. He took a sip, and she informed Lei Lei of 'good news'. Anyway, there is a 'pan' is not it? \\nI have thought of out in Leirei. In the autumn of 1956, Ao Nai Yam Leilei set down the affair. People in the village are 'Lang Cai girl, born one'. Zeng, Ao Nai Yao became the right wing, became a teaching man, the mouth of the man became 'a flower and a bull was inserted into the cow', some of them took her earlier, so as not to be affected by the rush, some of her elephant, she beat the drums. But all the '' of some good people, all the '' went back. She is only one person, except the sea brother, she does not marry. By 1964, Lei Lei had been 25 years old. A woman who has long been in the village has already done a long time ago, only she is still waiting for it. She knows that, at most, one more year, her brother is about to go back. Due to her many times, she is deeply convinced of the policy of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau. Any right-wing family home in the three major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin will be forced to stay in the reform, even if the teaching is lifted. Only home in the village, go home. She fell into the darkness: lucky himself in the village, otherwise, the sea brother can be saved! \\nIn 1964, the village is doing four Qing. The village where Leilei is located, the old village, the old village, have been beaten into 'four unclear', first stepped down. The new branch and the village are the old people who have returned to the ministry. The more beautiful he came out, and the more beautiful, and 25 years did not marry a man, he made her bounty. He knows that she is waiting for her haiwang brother, and all know what kind of person she is. Or he also has the news that Ao Nai is about to gather in Changzhou for six months, and he will take the policy of 'first hand'. On the one hand, Leilei's father and then exert its power under the name of 'media'. On the one hand, it directly started, forcing her to 'rightists to clear political circles'. Leilei was unwilling, rebellied; but her father, 'arm and thighs' went, did not answer, no answer, but also had to answer the fruit, and he had no answer, and he had no answer to her marriage. Not to protect her 'illegitimate' marriage. I was performed in the village with a sorrow of people. \\nAoNaiju's younger brother Ao Nai-zhu was in Changzhou's home. He looked at the village and took a variety of ramirai racks to her 'husband's house'. Leilei cried and shouted, but she was even sympathetic to her, but rather her sputum was obsessed, put a lot of people not marry, miss the anti-revolutionary revisors! \\nSince 1962, rightists have concentrated on the rivers, allowing the family to receive once a month. and special table good、Home in Beijing,You can go home to see。 Ao Nai-hou went to the Hehe, and his family was in Beijing, and he was also treated by the humanitarians. Ao Nizhu, Changzhou back, brother recounted his eyes. His intention, is to want to make a quick knife, brother to miss the rai, lest the old back of the heavy burden of thought. I have thought of a great brother a lot of news, poor dazzling. First, he can not understand whether Lei Lei can survive in broad daylight to the 'husband's family'. Second, he lost the only spiritual pillar, and he himself had the courage and strength to live. But he has a belief, that is to put himself out of the life and death of his own life and death, all people know. He had come to three years of teaching, and the Public Security Bureau did not let him out. He had nothing to say, and he left only 'to put a little bit out'. \\nHe was thinking, and he did it. From 1964 to 66, he made use of the work of the abusive, sadly sadly and sadly put a true story. It is a pity that the Xizi is called by 'elements' as a solicitation, first of all informing, receiving and receiving, is criticized, to be unaware of the whereabouts. \\nThat is his life. As soon as the manuscript was copied away, he hanged day and night, no longer wanted to live. Once again, the second spiritual pillar collapsed. \\nThe sixth chapter, the other stoves,\\nI finished his narrative, is a very good man's material, and drummed him to start, and go down. I am not a writer, I am also a man, I answer what I can to help him to complete his work. With my support, he picked up once again, and he made his devotion with his whole body and mind. He uses everything to sneak, one drop, get more real, more investment, also more wonderful, more level. \\nIn the winter of 1969, Lin Biao-huibu first, the evacuation order, I taught some right-wing elements for 12 years, in addition to the few 'gigu', were sent to the Handan. In addition to the transformation, most of them were picked up hats, lifted teaching, most of them were sent to Shanxi's reformation position to 'control'. I and Ao Nai and more than 20 people, also do not know what the reason. I have the privilege of being left in the Qinghe, and live in the 'North' of the 'North', which is a former prisoner The place of the is not now, but it is still called 'North'. \\nNorth before, once lived in a lot of people, now only ten people, empty houses. \\nAccording to the set, 45 people live in a room, Ao Nai himself a empty house, a person lived, know, also have to stop. He can eat any kind of affliction, and the house of great winter has fire, and he can endure it. I know that the reason why he has to endure the cold and hide everyone,In addition to the isolation,More main reason,Is that he can get up the house,With his whole life his part 'sang'! \\nAo Nai silent words, personality, a person in the room more, rarely chat with people, is a good man, what things are the first people I think, don't bother your own gains and losses. He made his own, proclaimed: 'My, I have something to go out only, as long as I am on the line, I fix it myself.' But it is the old good man, but also 'molecules' can't be tolerated. I do not know that he is with the 'My bit is not in the',Is a critique of 'anti-retrofit counter-current' waiting for him to be caught up. There are not many people who do not talk about, in addition to the in the middle of the, only a big old coodle cattle do not mouthfully and mouthless. People used to be a landlord, not to the words, is a typical 'people's defiant', is also one of the beachers of Baizu Pei, every time, there are no crimes, by him holding the bag in front 、Fist。 Ao Nai people blame, fingering his eyes, he can't do anything, and not to the fire of people, have to woo together. He stood out, and he said, 'Ao Nai, do you know what you are? Suffering thee, whoever commits a crime, is a third-class citizen; they are brought into another. Third class citizens are only equipped with tipans, not worthy of a rush, the third class citizen's seat is in the Qinghe. Do you know not? '...' He's a little bit, very smiling. No, Ao Nai's acceptance of the criticism, this is more silent, and fewer people have gone away. \\nThe 'singing' of the 'singing' of the Hasube became again. I have become his good friend. His manuscript is that he made a chapter and I read a chapter. The 'new version of the little' is only to Ao Nai Yao was sent to teach to stop, on the one hand is that he has a lot to go down, on the other hand is also because he can't go on emotionally. He is too unfair. He is like a real girl Lei-Lei, she is too unfair. If you look at it, it is a rai rai. For she cried and cried, and disobeyed her. But she is a weak person again, and in front of the Dao's 'politics', she resisted and used it. 'How can I bear my heart and hurt her again?' Ao Nai Hands, Nai Nai Won I. \\n' Why don't you let her die?' I'm out of mouth. \\n' Oh yeah! Her innings, even if he died, her death was almost as dead. You really know, how can I think of a step!' In this, he became sick again. Don't get to the little again I see. It is also a pain that he has to get the hole of the West is not worthy of me, but also he has to put the Lei Lei to die is also a pain, it is he again I see, even if it is a simple solution. \\nThe seventh chapter, the future is elusive\\nThedays also have to be found in 1972, and the Cultural Revolution has been working for six years. If we count from 1957, history has gone for 15 years, but The government approached the right-wing elements who had been imprisoned for 15 years and had been 'put out' according to the news. \\nIn addition, it is no longer a ghost, and the right is removed from the hat, the right is the right wing, according to the abusive image of the government, and 'the contradictions of different sexuality.' The rightists of 'my contradictions' actually become the political rancor of thieves who are 'contradicted by the people's paradox', and those who go to change, are the '' of the law to understand the problem. \\nMany right-wing elements who have been wearing hats and rescheduling their table, once they have picked their hats, stay in, wait for a change of sentence to 'jail sentences', and do not see a way out at all. is born of a dignified differentiation, a man's own mastery energy, adversity wrestling, wrestling; a man succumbed to the situation, take away the road of defiance or even sink, himself. \\nAnd among the people who take it, one is a hard-ridden, crumbling resistance, go the way of escape, or steal through the borderland, to overseas, to the bottom of the dilemma, or to flee to Xinjiang, Meng, do free wandering, a day is counted as a day. \\nThere is the original outside of the British, Hong Kong has a wife married, solve the and children to go, Nan steal over the border, the fruit of the boom was prevented beat his legs, caught back,. He has a russian russian writings of Enles, his wife is a Tibetan clan, has fled to India. He is trying to smuggle people into the country, and the case was arrested. You have a new Peking University, fled to Xinjiang to live on the flint, the years to be detained because of his identity, the most escorted back to. It is good that this man is good, and it is too heavy to fall. \\nAnother man is, know the 'arm is not thighs go', in what can't be done, just want to do a person's manners, put all your energy into the matter, Their own place, the people left nothing, but also in this way to seek the most common way out of their own. \\nThere is a 'bright day' magazine,Use all the,Sneakly in a small article,Site rest,Sitting under the holiday, Put yourself in the tool room, only like '', dead 30 years can have a publication, that is, 'God's innocent and bitter people, in 1984, his little published, A total of 5 volumes 150 words), Naturally, there are few people who can accomplish their mission in a consistent manner, and less can really do it. \\nTo dissipate people, due to different degrees, so the table out of the imagery, but also by people, can be varied, no wonder. noodles, but also can be divided. The following is a little bit of an example to see. \\nThe first man, became an 'alcoholic'. \\nThere is a squad of right-wing elements, the original is the Beijing Municipal Cultural Bureau of the branch Department, the first to the, West revolving, Tui Ya Ruya, Dao Tang, par, rush is a Sprouting, pouring down also phase, has the heart of the fetal bone in the. But 10 years of, right hat picked, he also 'fetal bone', can even be 'before judging people': he lost his family, everything is not interesting, only the thing in the cup . He is not alcoholic, drinking only one small glass at a time, a lot about. But every meal must be drunk, 3 meals will not be drunk. The cheapest two wine also to 1 bottle, he drink 1 bottle 3 days, drink 10 bottles per month, to 17. words, seems not much, but his month of work, a total of only 27 yuan, 17 yuan drinking, eating, pumping, daily necessities, and so on is only 10. There is nothing to do. When he did not steal, he did not go, his parents had gone, his wife was married, in addition to being subdued, it was a dead object. Yes, his coats of material, go out on one piece or go out directly with him-in the village of Zhouqian, there are many people who are also 'easy'. \\nBy the 70s, his clothes had been a thousand 'windows' perforated, just afraid to send them what they wanted. There is a minimum, but the hobby of 3 cups a day is not easy. In the morning, a bowl of rice porridge, half stinky tofu, also have a drink. \\nTherice paddy to be harvested has a thin ice, but he wore the garment of the cavern. The two also have a good day. That morning I was sitting on the position 'every day',Suddenly scratched the north,The sky was cold。 And he sat by my side, wearing a quilt. Coming to work, he stabbed me: 'Can you borrow me 5? I want to get a cotton vest. Today, if there is a cotton, I can only hide in the room, I can't work anymore.' I: 'As long as you really get a cotton vest, I'm you five, don't you. No, you can take it and go to the wine!' He swore by faith, saying, If I take the wine, I am your slap! Under the 'every day', he took me to his 5 fast run to the supply station, not a hard work, one hand a bottle of two ran back. When I look at it, he is not a cotton vest, he smiled and heartfelt to me: 'My cry called 'cotton', is worn on the stomach. As long as I put on '', I'm not cold, I can work out...' He is carrying the unraveled Wei, wait until the policy of falling, he died in the Qinghe. \\nThe second man, is the 'color ghost'. I, too much, too thin. Because the old husband of Kong also 'color food also', a normal person, has a desire to eat is normal, the abnormal is that it is more than ten to twenty years to change the right. More young people have entered the middle age and marry. In normal marriage, then they have to go out. \\nFewer women, only a few people in the field, the women who are trapped in the village, according to the policy can put the bounty in a 'contract worker', per month Diversified work. More than 60 yuan in January, can be held, once there is a child, it is not. Therefore, there is a small family out of the purpose of 'household', there is a lot of money or even three or four 'good', become a public secret, some people refer to her, even her husband has to take a single eye One eye. In 1969, Lin Biao made the first 'evacuation order', concentrated a large number of 'two changes' from Qinghe to Shanxi, leaving his wife in Qinghe. is another part of the home 'loneliness' and strokes 'wild', or can't afford the 'wild bee wave butterfly' and 'lost', there are many people in. \\nA research institute project a month only 27, but every month to send 10, in order to get sneaky 'Spring Degree', 'I am the child of her!' In addition to this, there are those who become thieves, as well as criminals. , is in the 'see no way out' situation, each person's love of the fragile part, it will be. \\nItis inevitable to become sad and miserable, and most embarked on the path of 'self-destruction'. \\nIn the reformation, because of the reasons of the and more people have gone, but also mostly strange, whenever someone himself, do not find a seat to put a roll of dead people in place Even if the burial is done, during the 'Cultural Revolution' period, he wants to summon the middle or the big boss, and the dead will do a routine critique. \\nTheway of self-esteem is based on people. More than usual is hanging. Generally, the middle of the night sneak ran to the open space of the room to find a crooked neck to put himself on the branch, wait until the next morning, already stiff. Some people run out of all its, a bottle of wine, a pinch of cake, peanut rice tofu, sitting in the river, eating and drunk to the river, jumping to the river, dead also do 'ghost'. Than 'out of the box' is 'touching high'. 25 Fu Jingjintang Gao Road, which has a section of the Qianqing River, pole is a cement pillar, there is a climbing with a worker, the general people don't climb, but is located on the shore of the Chaobai River , is a triangular pier, as long as it is an adult, most can climb up. One day, until someone climbs the tower, the man has climbed high, and no more. All of a sudden, and everyone knows that the man is going to take his own hands. But some people dared to climb up the tower to save each other, because it was not good, it was to be the same as his own. The only method is to shouting under the tower, with good rhetoric, some unabusive rhetoric. Ran, everyone knows how high it is, and his empty cheque will not be. The quilt, everyone embraces the quilt, under the tower, to [from the man] to fall without falling. However, he did not know what the role of the 25 people who were high. The man's hand was stretched to the gao, by him to the pagoda, the people became a fiery, only a fire-colored fire, the whole person immediately became a fireball, the bear burned with ten points. Most became a little larger than the ball of the fuzzy lump left on the tower, while the road actually had any shadow, until the next day, the sent people to remove the ''. \\nIn the month of that year, too many people, people in the Qing River, there were no blame. \\nAo Nai good sound and composer. At the end of 1972, he took a new song. The song name 'Bu operator', this is a song, said:\\nNot a rush,\\nSeems to be preoccupied. \\nFlowers and flowers fall their own,\\nJun (finger), Lord. \\nGo also to go,\\nHow to live? \\nWaiting until the mountain flower cut off,\\nMo. \\nThepier is the Song Dynasty Taizhou (now Zhejiang tiantai), a songdae called rui. Rui word Youfang, very talented, can be good, Tungu, color, Taizhou Taishou Tang Zhongyou is also very heavy on her, often recruit her. One year, Zhu Xi, the Avenue, Patrol Zhejiang South, he and Tang Zhongyou had a conflict, he had a contradiction, he had a fight against Tang Zhongyou, and he searched for his 'sin', he caught him up and tortured, forced her to recruit Tang Zhongyou. 'Unpositive' line. Under the law of the Qing Dynasty, officials are not prostitutes. Officials to procure prostitutes is not a crime, but 'prohibited'. Rui Ran was flogged, Xia Chu, mired in a lot of months, dying, not yielding, not confession. She was in the hall to disobey, and did not make a word about Tang Zhongyou disadvantageous, Zhu Xi also took her, so the name was even more. Shortly after Zhu Xi went away, the sentence was brought to death (word and business secretary), to resign, and she was unabated by her. The famous 'Bu operator', is she in the temple of the and so 'Mingzhi'. \\nWith the glorious charm, with the glamorous charm, there is a faint of sorrow, but also has the spirit of resistance to violence and persecution. He implicitly accuses feudal crimes, and there is no shortage of the rest of his grief and humiliating life, the resentment, and the vision of a free life. So soon, the first love of the 'Bu Operator', will soar the population. \\nThe story of Zhu Xi persecuted Tang Zhongyou, most even to the emperor's ears. . He is in the choreography: Tang Zhongyou Tang often Zhaoku Rui sang At the May 16 banquet, Tang Zhongyou's Qigao missionary to 'Bu operator, not', by Rui sang at the feast to help the wine-that is,, the pioneer is not. \\nThe 'Bu Operator is not'. Song Dynasty's 'Yi Zi Zhi Zhi', the meticulous '', and Shao Guizi's 'Snow Zu' and so on. She is talented, people are very boneless. There are other pioneers made in the 'Sen Zi', 'Tung Guanji', 'Ancient and Present Female History', 'The History of the Woman', and the Qing Dynasty Xu Yun's 'Yuyuan' and 'Pear Blossom' 'Xian · Biewu first out', grid and taste 'Bu operator, not' are very similar. \\nRegardless of the head 'Bu operator · not' its song of grievance, clearly is his own 'at this moment' mood, We have long had the idea of 'go'. It is a pity that I only pay attention to the beauty of Qu, sang it, to pay attention to his words. There are many people who have been saddened by the Qinghe, and he has played the role of 'speed up'. After the month, by the state of the situation again changed, to him under the heart of the world 'again'. \\nChapter 8. His self-title is 'martyrdom'\\nIn March 1973, there was a news of the, I was in the north more than 20 people, all want to go to six points to the West Village. \\nSix points, West Village, is the famous 'Guan Village', because of the 'Cultural Revolution', 'Mao Thought Class', there is a Kuo, to use torture in good faith The whole person is famous. In the 'Mao Thought' each division of people go to build Since there is a piece of 'cool people' in the, according to the 'two reformation' of the political elephant can be good? Therefore, people are dismayed, they are afraid of the news is true. \\nI was assigned to replace the class and live in a house with fire. In the kanzai, can live a person in a fire house, it is not the 'special'. \\nOn March 27, is February 23, it is already spring, but the day is very cold. The ice of the river was daytime, to the night, and a thin ice in the morning. That night, I was boiling the beans on the cattle, and Ao Nai was suddenly picking up a large plastic bag looking for me. He took out a big plastic bag of powder, a pack of green vegetables, half a bottle of oil and a small package of monosodium glutamate. In the month of that year, the oil boiled powder to eat, it is already a delicious taste. And I washed a pot of water, and boiled all the powders and vegetables he took, and a basin, a pot of eats, and five people to eat. Cooked to, plus oil monosodium glutamate, I put all the oil and spiced noodles I add, people sat down, one side to eat powder, a blind chat to six points to go of the message. The house of six points has been vacated, and it is the thing to go. Anyway, I was the old man I had most talked about, and I had a lot of talk, I also went to my heart. \\nIn that month, my stomach was very good, eat everything very fragrant, and a great amount of food. But the night Ao Nai did not eat much, at least I ate much. Eat the belly, is very late, he stood up to go, suddenly he took out a 'Jiang' I: 'You send you, stay miss it!' is a fine print of five, thick, set a lot, I'm on the people half a month of work, flat he To, with cowhide wrapped well, easy to touch. I have a good sound, lala violin, with the same also joyaki, special with a western-style pier accompaniment. Today, he suddenly sent his own festive West to me, and Ming Yun is 'stay in love', what does it mean? Suddenly I woke up, and I stumbled up a word: 'What are you?' I thought he was not covered up, but faint: 'I want to wrap, stay it.' I was dismayed, stunned, and he said: 'Wait again, look at it. He does not accept us, but we want to bear himself. Not to you, the face of the, not live as dead, I also thought of to myself, but thought of an old mother, under the young girl, got to have his own rumbling...' He laughed: 'I'm not one with you. My old mother has gone, and my wife has been torn by others, and my old father has a brother, and I want to serve. In the world, I have got anything, but also what can be done, I can rest assured to go.' After a word, he does not seem to want to talk to me, and pull the house to go on his own. \\nSuddenly the thing was born, and one night, how did I sleep?. I am thinking against the backlash that he has clearly told me that he does not want to live, so what about me? Going to Himoto? No. The fruit of the complaint is not to send people to look at him, to prevent him from self-provoking. And a man who wants to die, is not able to see. Ben I am his trusted friend,, my friend most also lost. It is a greater pain. Well, is it not to tell him about his other good friend, and everyone is trying to stop him? Think again, is not. He can accuse me of his intention to die, and make it clear that I am the only one he believes. He believed I was not going to complain, so he revealed his meaning to me. If I go to complain about people, people who do not go to the abusive complaint,, the fruit is worse. I went to the ground test all night, and the most I made was actually: I don't tell, I don't know. Since he died in heart, he was careful examination, his death was his best stay, then he went to his best way to go. \\nThe next morning, the next morning, it will inform you to play, dragged as a tool. I put the West to the place where I put it up, Ao Nai Zi made three times with his own own, and he went to a concentrated place. He greeted everyone, and he put his luggage on it. He did not sat and dragged, and he had his own hands, and he could go to six minutes of the West Village. \\nIt is reasonable and reasonable, I also have doubts, I know who he wants to die, also thought that he was waiting to give me a permanent accusation. \\nInfront of his name, there Ao Nai, everyone where he went, everyone answered: 'His cousi is in the tribulation, and he has gone first.' But when I come to the village of Nishimura, I will not take his shadow. Before moving, go to the West or see friends, it is also possible, so we still have doubts. Wait until the sky is dark, not his shadow, I would like to see things bad, but I can not, only the next day again. \\nThe next day, I and many people went out to find him, and I looked for his friends, all looked at him. On the third day, I went back to the north and found his whereabouts. You are called Li Yande, is a very loyal Qizhou people, he was designated to stay in the North to feed, I return to the North, first go to him. He: 'Everyone moved away to,In the afternoon four or five Ao Nai back to take a trip, West,See the wine。 He gave me a bag, and asked me to deeming. I want a plastic cloth again, and I put my plastic bed to him.' He deming is not the right, but a 'spear', that is, the 'people's crooked offender'. Thief is a thief, good friend of the West are stealing, Ao Nai Xi is no exception, but is very '', friends what things, as long as with the word '' does not stick with the word '', he Also to be. Using his 'spear' identity and his character, Ao Nai Ji often turned his little favor and became a good friend with him in order to hide his manuscripts in case the manuscript was copied the second time. I want Li Yande to take a look at the package, and he hesitated to take a look. There is a seal, I play a look, the face is his small manuscript, there is an inch thick. I looked at the manuscripts, turned my hand over, the dead of Lei Lei, all I looked at. That is,, his little is finished. The 'master' of his manuscript is the 'master' of his manuscripts. Before going to six points, he avoids the '' to find a ballast of life and move the manuscript out, but also in reason. Got to want to die. I again Li Yande: Ao Nai, go to that Li Yande used his hand to a finger at the pond, and my heart immediately went away. \\nThere is a large pond beside the North Grapes, which is the former grape pit, with the deepest six meters. When the grapes were unearthed, few people went to the wilderness. Ao Nai Ji a man to go to the what? I rushed to the pond to find the cauldron. But on the rayaki of the Ikekishi, by his own. The crawl on the frame, a wrap, above with a grabbled grass:\\nFriend：\\nExcuse me, I'm going to take one step first. \\nWhatmust be clear is: I am self-sustaining because of my loss, political reprimanence, and even more to six points. \\nI'm not waiting for you. The lake is too cold, and I want you to get out of the water, I am unbearable. In I think of a piece of law: you I receive the wait, as long as you pull a little bit on the line, you can not use the water. No, the moment, the soil is shaking, digging the pit to fight, very tired. I can't afford to my friends who dig into the pit. I specially wrestled you with the two bottles, but I am your consolation. In addition, there is a bottle, is a friend of my clothes. \\nI know that the taste is also very bad. I have a lot of your wine, but my strength is not enough. \\nI'm crushing, leaving a great deal, for a remembrance. \\nI have a cotton coat, there is a cotton coat, he wants to be big, cotton has been very, must be used. Sweater, fur, shoes, can be. It is better to inform my family to go back. Tubes are not very much value, but it is going to be. \\nThe most, friends who fend up, before the bunch, don't forget to drink. It can send you to the world. \\n, friends, all grudges and grudges, all have, they have. \\nAo Nai\\n1973.3.28.

Then, I can't take up 30 or 50, but his hands have three hundred to 'Zhou'. It is not an easy task to borrow from him. He is Shakespeare under Shakespeare Shakespeare's Sherlock: To borrow from him, first take the West mortgage, borrow 10 interest, maturity, collateral will be collected, he has the skills to collect the collateral Go out, he loaned out 'Ben'. No one, if it was not for the road, he would not borrow a high interest from him. \\nAo Nai's boom came out, and the caretaker's Ren fell to the man.

Ao Nizhu hurry up to go to: 'My dad is sick, something you and me.'

It's just that someone knows a little bit, someone knows a little bit; some people are eye-catchers, and others are the way. \\nIn the beginning of 1999, published by Henan People's Publishing House, Mr. Nai Yuan, there is a chapter of 'Death', which is the death of the people in Qinghe. Mr. Yo Ao naisong. \\nThe article of thedeath of Mr. Ao naisong is the fourth article, if it is arranged in the first order of the list. The previous article is my, the first cry table in the 'present ancient Qi' Zhi and 'I am in the political' in a. Another article,hee in the 'Towards Chaos' one piece attached to. \\nIn the summer of 1997, I invited Wu Yao to 'The Present Gu Qi', the whole colleague of the Shizhi Society, to talk about the painful story of the death of Ao Nai Yao in the middle of his death. Comrade Shisha and Comrade Shu Shu Shaokui made a great sense. I must make it out for him to make a table. \\nI am not familiar with it, because I am the end of 1964, the two major right-wing clandestine, while Ao Nai is in 1965 The right religion, I and him are all 'three', and he will be unfamiliar with him. I have all gone to the Qinghe, but I am still not in a few minutes. Therefore, I'm simply dying Ao naisong.

I can tell him first about Ao Nai's pain story, and it is also a consolation for the dead. Therefore, Mr. gladly in the middle of a busy busy day I have made a lot of pussy, Ao Nai Yao is the right and the self-pitched. I use small letters densely to the original, there are more than 6. \\nMr. Geneki's mediator, coupled with some stories and materials, I made a short article called 'The Martyrs of Self-Martyrs'. The article is in the form of the story of Mr., using the first person, 'I' in the article, is completely Mr.'s mouth, so special add a pair of people, called 'big my story'. \\nAfter thearticle was finished, I tortured a magnet to send Mr.. To know that he does not know how to in the document, the original is how the original, he has to see. The article was published in Issue 6, 1997. Unfortunately, the article only highlights the self-prominence part, leaving the first half of the sentiment parts of the whole. I sent to Mr. Zee, he looked at: 'The article is not bad, the article is also very raw.' In April 1998, 'Hundreds of Years Tide' published a 'hundred years tide boutique series',To me,I will put the full draft of the manuscript to him,Received the published in August of the year I 'The political drama' is in the midst. The manuscript is also a little bit more than the 'present ancient Qiqi', but a lot more than the 'present ancient lei love that paragraph,Basically retained。 However, the bad thing is that Mr. Qiao did not know what reason it was, and biased to exclude the deputy. is originally the story of Mr.,In the people see,In the article 'I' is not Mr., is I more.

Mr.'s reason is that it is impossible to get it when Ao Nai Hou sat in the early hours of March 28, 1973, beating his hands by the pond. However, it is not possible to solve the problem, that waits around quietly, there are any outsiders, and he has a full boom that can slowly steal his woes? From the analysis of the situation, I believe more than a lot of people's narrative, it is likely that there is a 'group of' ingredients; and what I am, is my 'manuscript', not the original.

On the fan of Ao naisong, he did not know that it was an epigram, which he came up with himself. is: ', can only get out of a man's waiting,, line is okay.' \\nIn 1969, I was taken to the right, and Gash, and the people were taught. Unfortunately, my table did not pass, so it was able to go. The clear-cut lines of the right make it impossible for the 'Government' to grasp. exposed to the water, is a piece of table set and a square table set, I'm. \\nThe people of the table, their. The square table has me, I, my former, who lay on the ground in 1989, there are six people who lived in 1979 by means of political interrogation, life for the purpose of generation. . There is Wang Jing, the highest IQ and hardest bone among the right. Hudu Lake's purse bone, every day looking at the sunset, waiting for the death, also have lost the pride of Wang Jing, without a word to see the, you can go to the fire of three homes, and get started.

The first person to be unveiled is Guo of the table set, the old man of the ballet garden. A small play in the chest of ink. He who was unveiled, was Ao Nai. Ao Nai is a real right, people trust him, he knows a lot of curbs, his unveiled, yunqiu, tianqu, haiand so on, also to me again. is a small collection of the real. In words, he gave the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the negative of the Cultural Revolution. He was actually doing the underground revolution according to the 'how to do it'. \\nThere are waiting, accidentally also save a life. If the is not 'evacuation', it is a dozen and three anti-dozen in the Cultural Revolution. And the revelation of Ao Nai, he went to the torment. \\nAo Nai Yee himself. Before the Qinghe broke up, I saw Ao Naihou doing his ideological work in Wang Jing. Mao was really sincerely trying to correct the bad woes that he wanted to rectify. Engage the reverse right. I letter, Ao Nai is really believing in the night, people believe that he is willing to believe, Ao Nai forcing himself to believe in the law. But Ao Nai Hou has been forcing himself to believe the words. \\nItis the pain of saying that the face of what he did, the most eonizing moon of Ao naisong. He has the law of his own. Remorse is the most enduring of those who have deceived themselves, and those who have conscience. \\nHe could not change it, and he did himself. \\n PAGE 25"}
