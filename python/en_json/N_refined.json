            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached 1] Yubei Hou: 'South Ding to go, big flag does not fall' (2016.11.12)\\nOlder people are afraid to boil the winter. In the early winter of Zhengzhou this year, it is strange, cold air like a little wife, not to appear, but still take away a highly respected old man. \\nHe is the carrier of the Yu Army of Literature, Mr. Nandin. \\nMr. Nightdin's curriculum vitae looks like this:\\nNanding, formerly known as Ho Nan ding, Bengbu in Anhui. CCP member. Completed at East China School of Journalism in 1949. Previous editor of 'Henan Daily', editor of Henan province, professional writer, chairman, secretary of the group. Consultant of Henan Federation and Writers Association of Henan Province, chairman of the Committee on Protection of Literary and Artists Copyright of Henan Province, Fifth Committee of China Federation, 7th and Eighth People's Congress of Henan Province. Published works since 1950. 1956 Joined China Writer Association. Published novel episodes 'Inspector Ye Ying', 'At Sea', 'Defendant', 'Tail', essay essay essay 'Watermark', 'Selected South' (upper and lower volumes), and the Nandinese Book (five volumes). \\nBut to learn more intuitively about Mr. Nighting's experience, you can use the words written by Anhui writer Hu Zhufeng to summarize:\\n'South of the 1950s, working in literature; South of the 1960s, in life; South of 1970s, in the wind and rain, South of the 1980s, carrying the banner of art and art of the Central Plains...' \\nSince 1991, Nandin retired as Chairman of the Union, and since then he has been the immortal day of his pencils. \\nAnd now the big star fell, Wen Xian West, Mr. Nandin past bit, will become the material of people of the Minyois people. We may wish to use Hu Zhufeng to summarize Mr. Nandine's key words, beaded into lines, memories of Mr. Nandine's life two or three things, to send condolences. \\nMr. Nanding was originally a Bengbu, Anhui. He was 18 years old together with 30 students from East China School of Journalism in Shanghai to work in the Henan Daily in Kaifeng at that time. Two months later, he had not had time to write news, he was led by old comrades from the newspaper to Xuchang rural areas to participate in the 'anti-domination battle'. \\nIn February 1950, after returning from the countryside, he was selected to work in Henan Wenlian creative team. 'What was creation then? What to write? Do not understand.' Mr. Nightdin recalled. \\nFortunately, at that time, the creative team came to the famous poet Xu Yuluo, and then came from Shanghai to Mr. Yao Xueyin. It is in such an environment that slowly follows them to write things, and from here on the road to writing, Mr. Nightdin said. \\nIn 1953, Nandan went to Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory to experience life, and in February 1955 published the famous short novel 'Ye Ying' in 'Yangtze River Arts'. \\nThe novel uses sophisticated conception, clean, detailed and practical language, vividly depicts the young workshop female inspector Ye Ying in order to lofty ideals, dare to be more true, positive work noble image, showing the new spirit of urban workers. \\n'Inspector Ye Ying' at a moment caused a strong reaction among readers. It was reproduced to People's Literature in August of that year, and the People's Education Publishing House also compiled it into high school language textbooks. 'Ye Ying' became an idol of the times at a time. \\n'In 1956, the National Young Writers' Congress discussed the author's short story, when I was very cattle, and my 'Inspector Ye Ying' ranked first.' In that year, South was only 25 years old. Later, every time, the old man was still proud to remember the situation. \\n'I have experienced all the political movements since the founding of New China, and I played different roles in the left as the right. Society is a big director, let you be what you do!' When Mr. Nightding said this word, only the practice and transparency of life, did not reveal a silk. \\nBeing beaten into the right, devolved to the Dabieh Mountains for transformation, was the beginning of Mr. Nendin's life. \\nIt was a period of old days. Day after day to mountain mining, Shimoda work, 12 years, Mr. Nan ding did not write a thing. \\nDuring the torment, the elderly are not enough for the outside humanity. But the writer Sun Muqing wrote about such a detail in the Literature Old Man Ho Nan ding. \\nIn Zhengzhou railway station, every time from here and then return to Xinyang Xinyang County right labor retraining, Mr. Nandin can't help but shadly. On one occasion, he was painfully and painfully removed the only money on his wrist-a Shanghai brand watch, looking for cigarettes for two packs of gold leaf cigarettes. The top of the worthless sale, to the old people at the time, but is the inner consolation. When a bite of smoke spits out with the breath of the heart, the poor heart is healed. \\nMr. Nightdin said he had smoked since 1953 and had not put it down again. Sun Muqing said that Mr. Nanding's cigarettes are not small, and he smokes very nice, very natural and elegant. \\nPerhaps, the old man smoked at the train station at that time, he didn't say so much. \\nOut of Mount Dabieh, and went into Dabetsu Mountain \\nMr. Nandan, 39, was relegated to the Nanyang West Gap during the Cultural Revolution. \\nIn the deep depths of Dabiesan, came to the 'right' Ho Nanding, Sanmin called him 'Ho Tai Pot' (brother), the local dialect, no distinction. 'Ho Tai Pot' sat on an equal footing with the mountain people and became a family of sunrise and sunset. \\nThe life of Mr. Nightdin was still well, but his mind was completely different when he was 28 years old. From this deep mountain road, there is a family of three people who home, Mrs. Zuo Chun, daughter Xiangyang. Optical name, it is full of poetics. \\nThe small water team unveiled the three houses of Kamakura, and gave Mr. Nan dingg 'Kan Ta Lei' a study room. In the mangang Funiu Mountain Road, since the bus, the car is flying down the slope of Kamakura. After Mr. Nanding settled here, dedicated one stop: Ho. \\nIn 1993, Mr. Nightdin was 60 years old. That year he went to Xixia for a meeting, there was an elderly man, no money to buy a ticket, and walked 70 miles to see him. He is the production captain Wang Yun summoning at the time of the devolution of Mr. Captain King saw his face, rushing, and only one word: 'Want you, come to see you. Do not eat the meal at the meeting.' Finish, turn around and go. \\nIn the spring of 1980, when Mr. Nandine was committed to creating and maintaining a good creative momentum, the second meeting of Henan province was held again after 26 years, at which he was elected vice-chairman of Henan Province. \\n'Perhaps by nature, I take this vice chairman into a position, and I want to make a point.' At that time, Mr. Nightdin saw many places created large literary journals based on the publication of novels, and Henan's novel creation was weak, and he strongly suggested that Henan should also run a large journal. \\nSoon, he named 'Mangyuan' for this issue. It is the creation of 'Mangyuan', for henan literature germination and growth in the future to provide a broad world, and also laid a very important foundation for the rise of the Chinese Plains. \\nIn August 1983, Nightdin was appointed chairman and secretary of the group of Henan Federation. In the late 1980s, 'Literature Yu Jun' was born, and the Chinese strength of Yujun, such as Li Peifu, Zheng Qiying, Tian Zhongho, Zhang Yu and other heavyweight writers, were transferred by Mr. Nandin as chairman of Henan Province. \\nCircle people analyze the reason for the rise of 'literary Yu Jun', can not open Mr. Nandin this 'Alpine'. All say that literary people are light, Wentan has always been a lot. However, people who know the inside know that Mr. Nandin is very caring, treating and supporting Henan writers. In his eyes, only the talents and merit of the writers were left. All he thought was how to create conditions for them to come up with good works and contribute to Henan's literary career and the new Chinese literary career. \\nEveryone thinks that Mr. Nightdin can unite all writers, can care for all writers, no matter how defiant this writer is, and whether he is close to himself or not. \\nThis is of great practical and educational significance to the present altar. \\nWriter Li Peifu said he founded Henan's first large literary publication 'Mangyuan' with the slogan: to run a literary land, pull up a team of literary and Henan army... he did it. Until today, the development of Henan literature, the construction of the team, and this 'tree man' is inseparable. This is the 'flag' we need to remember. \\nWriter Zhang Yu said that he was talented and gracious, and I myself believe that several of our middle-aged writers have grown and progressed from learning to be a man. He is the big tree of the Wentan of Henan, the old example of the Wentan of Henan. \\nWhether it is 'flags' or 'big tree', the later's admiration to Mr. Nandingh has been as high as the river. At a literary salon where he attended, he remained silent when the attendees gave him a tidal praise again. After all of the speakers here, Mr. Nightdin smiled and whispered with his humorous tone: 'What are you saying?' \\nFull of consternation, not waiting for everyone to slow down, Mr. Nandin had the lyrics of Zhang Kwok Wing song 'I':\\nI always love this I, happiness is more than one way to be happy, the most honored is the creator's glory, do not hide, live for my life, without ink, standing in a bright corner. I am me, is a different color fireworks, the sky sea, to make the strongest foam. I like me, let Vivian develop a result, lonely desert, as full of naked...\\nNowadays, Mr. Nightdin is gone, but he still leaves us with the fireworks of different colors. \\nEditor 丨 Yeon\\nAuthor Jin Shuihe Reporter (2016.11.12)\\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attachment 2】Zhao Fuhai: Mr. Nandan and Literature Yu Jun \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\)\\nIn the early\\n 1980s, literary and artistic circles just woke up from the 'Cultural Revolution', dipped people's minds 'critical seventeen years of literature and art' toxins have not been washed clean, hero characters must be 'gaoquan' creative principle has not yet been criticized, literary creation subject is still suburban themes, peasant Village theme two categories,' 'Scar literature' caused a shock, 'The position of love' surprises countless readers, and has a youth-themed novel to explore whether Chinese youth through the 'Cultural Revolution' is a confused generation or a promising generation? In this context, Henan Wenlian initiated literary workshops, listened to the voices of everyone, organized a 'style' activity that had long been lost in the literary world. The specific leader was Mr. Nandan, who was then Vice Chairman of the provincial collaboration. The first literary workshop, in the name of the new issue of 'Mangyuan', brought together nearly 40 amateur authors from rural areas, factories, schools and institutions in Henan. In fact, this is Nightdin's organizational preparations for the formation of a literary army of Henan. In the late 1980s, when Nandina loud raised the slogan of Literature Yujun, the backbone of the Henan Army came from the first literary workshop known as 'Whampoa Phase I'. Literature Yu Jun fights with Hunan Xiangjun, Shaanxi Shaanxi Jun, Shanxi Jinjun, Jingpai, Haipai, Baiyangdian, etc. \\nNan ding Anhui, Shaozhuang came to Henan, his bone and blood and blood and Central Plain culture entangled together. From the East China School of Journalism in 1949, he has been co-editor, professional writer, vice-chairman and party secretary in Henan province, he did not leave Henan, has always adhered to the literary front. Since 1950, the works have been published, including short fiction books, the defendant, the tail, the essay essay book 'watermark' and 'South' (upper and lower volumes), and the Nardine Book (5 volumes). For Nightdin, I learned from reading, attending literary classes to admire his personality charisma, which stems from Mr. Pang Kaji, the former editor-in-chief of 'Runway'. \\nOn that day, I listed a reading list of Jiaji. After reading, he said, 'Henan writer, you want to see Nandine. That day, 28 years away, was a summer, I helped in the 'running flow' to compile the 'bud special'. Go to the bookstore to buy 'replayed flowers'. The book collected the works of Shao Yanxiang, Liu Binyan, Wang Meng, Nandine and others. 'et al.' had all been beaten as the right, 'replay' is the affirmation of the people and works that were originally classified as the right. \\nMoney says: Eat eggs, do not have to see the chicken with eggs. That was his own modesty. I superstition Kaji, he's a senior editor and critic. In the early 1980s, reading heat swept the Chinese land, Jiaji let me list the must-read titles to him. He stressed the works of Nighttin, and of course I want to see myself. I saw Nandine in the canteen. He didn't eat much, but cigarettes were pumping one by one. First, are you a teacher of Nightin? And he sent a cigarette to me, and said to me, Jiaji blew me, and you learn well with him, and follow them. Following Yang Qian, the former deputy director of the editorial department of 'Running Flow', he went to Xihua farm to reform labour on a right-wing farm. He co-organized a 'blackboard newspaper for labor reform' with Li Qing, who was also the right-wing deputy director of the Zhengzhou Daily. Nightdin said: An editor-in-chief of a provincial journal and deputy director of a provincial capital newspaper, co-organising a blackboard newspaper. The two of them were 'main businesses', and the blackboard newspaper was amateur. A few days a few days, correctional personnel and correctional officers and correctional prisoners were competing 'Honestly transform, seriously do the blackboard newspaper seriously'. The right will be written in his labor reform, Li Qing will publish the 'Taiping Heavenly Kingdom' written in his labor reform, followed Yang as editor-in-chief of The Runflow magazine. For the first time, Nightdin did not speak of herself, but spoke of two right-wing parties. In the literary class, Nandine 'wide variety of harvest, focus on supporting', held several workshops on student works, to Li Pei Fu, take a 'celebrity consultation', ask the commentator to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of his work; for Zhou Yi, please edit the specific guidance, open his work workshop, and Nendin encouraged him to say: good language, can grow big Hand pen. Guide Sun Fangyou to form his own style to work: to Li Changhua's long article 'Sedan Legend', Nanding hands-made modifications. All student works, he must read each article, each reading must have specific comments attached, including typos, speech disease, he personally modify it. Nightdin said: This is his normal job, and we have to speak at a meeting, and to read the manuscript to make comments. His 'normal work' is moving and memorable, but the most reminiscent is his opening lectures, celebrity lectures, group style. The best thing about Nightdin's class is: Take a nest, and you're here to lay eggs! Nandine in the provincial union, provincial education college put the nest for us to 'lay eggs'. In the meantime, Nightdin invited celebrity to 'charge' us again. When graduating, Nandin again group let us get out of Henan 'style'. \\nThe 'lower egg' of two\\n Nandine says not only the image, but also bold. He does not talk about industrial topics, rural topics, youth themes. He said, don't be limited by the subject matter, what to write, how to write, is your own business. The class cheer, a spring breeze, a light rain, moisturize from factories, organs, rural authors, just out of the 'Cultural Revolution' shadow of our open mind, free of hands and feet, free creation. \\nNan ding invites everyone to 'charge' Li x, Yu Heding, Wang Dahai, film director Xie Jin, Chen Huaikai and so on. Wang Dahai talks about reading, for example Stonda's 'Red and Black', and 'Red and White' that we never heard of. The most vivid is a foreign prose 'Happy Yellow Handkerchief'. That's a moving love story. The sea is sitting in danger, sometimes standing and preaching, and sometimes tears, we resonate with it and tears. Chen Tao speaks on the elements of the creation of drama films, and approved 'layman leading the insider'. Director Xie Jin speaks on the human nature of the American film Soul Broken Blue Bridge. Human civilization should have 'abstract inheritance', and humanity is superior to class. That is, Xie Jin, 'Where is the Poison of 50 Films' in the Cultural Revolution, among them his 'Early Spring February' and 'Stage Sisters', the poison of the two films is 'humanism'. He speaks about humanity, surprising us, because we engage in literary creation, the mind to clear more things than inherited, such as 'class sex', we have always been a god and face 'humanity.' For half a century, literary circles have criticized Feng Ding's 'Heroic Impulse Theory'. Feng does not mention class sex, but talk about humanity. Criticized Shao Tsuen Lin's 'Humanity Theory'. Criticized Zhao Shuli's 'middle character theory', the middle character theory speaks about 'humanism.' Having criticized Qin Zhaoyang's so-called 'broad path of realism', he is naked anti-class. For half a century, literary creation saw the 'human nature' to be stunned. Xie Jin not only speaks about 'humanity', but also says that humanity is higher than class. Refreshing, the soul shakes. \\n28 years ago, the teachers spoke at all times, and the students listened to the time. So everyone 'eat, drink enough, go out', 'breakthrough', published works in other domestic literature journals, became the 'consensus' of the literary workshop, Zhang Yigong created the novel 'red candle of tears', and then won the National Novel Award. Li Peifu created 'Endless Morning', 'Red Grasshopper, Green Grasshopper', well received. Zhang Bin's 'Willow Leaf Peach' and 'Yang Hua Like Snow' made headlines in publications such as People's Literature. Li Keding's 'Pimple Mother's Complaints' and Yang Dongming's 'Grape-Picking Lad' are also published in People's Literature. Li Changhua's long novel 'The Legend of Sedan' and Sun Fangyou's Chen Zhou series novels have begun to be issued in several major domestic publications. Henan writers, a group rushed into the Chinese literary scene and made the literary community look at it. \\nNightdin group let us go to 'collecting style', starting from Henan Zhengzhou straight to the southwest, then Shun River down, to East China Shanghai, popular twenty thousand miles road, a line of 14 people by train, take a car, ship, walk on foot. In Kunming, Yunnan, into the stone forest, the Heilongtan, find the monuments of the Xishan, see '500 miles Dianchi rush to the bottom', eat authentic bridge rice line; in Sichuan, Deng Emei Mountain, Suhong Chun Ping, Baoguo Temple in front of the Baoguo Temple, saw in Dujiangyan Erwang Temple more than 2,000 years ago, water conservancy expert Li Bingjing proposed 'water Lee is the lifeblood of agriculture, the 'eternal theme' of agriculture. When I saw the 'Three Kingdoms' to please Liu Bei Zhang Song planted crooked neck pine trees, trees as human ugly. Deng Bai emperor city, standing Liu Beituo solitary 'A Dou', thinking is that uncle Liu from the 'Taoyuan three' soldiers guard room, eventually Wei, Wu, Shu tripod, history does not take the will of Liu as the transfer, eventually the three kingdoms to one Jin. Baidi City is the Yangtze River on the Qutangxia mountain temple, is generally climbing from the county, and we due to the boat anchor, until late, Zhi Bai Di City is left alone, a pedestrian rush to, the middle of the night, dangerous place, hand climbing. Temple owner Ouyang saw, said Baidi City from no brigade writers, late at night more rare. Henan people sincerely, in Chengdu Du Fu Cottage, Du Fu cry Kongming: 'The division did not die first, so that the hero tears.' Chongqing mountain city night splendid, thousands of lights such as the galaxy falling into the world. The most moving is the red rock, is the hero imprisoned dross cave, the viewer a solemn expression. A 'Red Rock' could be adapted into theatrical, dance, critique, film, peking opera and other literary forms, and thought of Li Runjie's allegro book 'Two Gun Granny', popular throughout the country. It was a time of burning passion, an era of heroes. In Shanghai, the preferred place to visit is the 'Commemorative Hall of the Communist Party of China'. \\nThree\\n such 'style' opened the atmosphere first in Henan literature history. Everywhere the local co-chair, novelist, poet, surprise and admiration. When we come to Kunming at the rainy season, the poet Yan Ji said: Kunming's climate is cold and summer, rain is winter, Kunming winter has come to the spring breeze in Henan, we will group a group to experience the culture of Central Plains. In Chengdu, Gao Ying, the famous writer who wrote 'Dage and Her Father', came to our residence, and said loudly: the South is good, Henan literature has risen! When looking at the poet's Liushahe River, he commented that 'collecting style' is a traditional practice. Now, we should have the guts. After all, we have been imprisoned for ten years, ah, South is not simple. In Shanghai, with Fei Liwen, chief editor of Shanghai Literature, said: There are manuscripts left for Shanghai Literature. Shanghai people also love sweet potato flavor. \\n'Egg', 'Charging', 'Wind'. Nandin carried out literary training and integration of Henan writers 28 years ago. When he became chairman and party secretary of Henan province, loud raised the slogan of literary Yujun, in the late 1980s, the Chinese Chinese and Yujun Zhang Yigong, Li Pei Fu, February River, He Xiangyang, Zhou Tongbin, Sun Fangyou, Li Erh, and so on at various stages lead the country. And the two literary lectures in the Yujun conducted three provincial cooperation presidents: Zhang Yigong, Zhang Yu and Li Peifu. Therefore, Nandin is not only the meaning of Henan literature, but also Chinese literature. \\nIn the second few years of the 1980s, I was directly led by Nightdin. Usually get along, everyone is casual. No matter old or old in the unit, they do not call Nightdin's duties, but call his name directly, and he also answered it. Nighttine, Nighttin, Nighttin became a cultural symbol. (Literary Freedom Talk 2009 Issue 2)"}

The defamation check was 'flipping the box, violating human rights, violating the Constitution'. To organize a confession to him for a review, admitting that the struggle was indeed wrong. He also actively pulls up dissatisfied people and joined him in attacking the party. \\nNimsin unscrupulously attacked the party's cadre policy. He cursed us to 'worship old cadres blindly, worship party members blindly'. He thinks that the selection cadres are 'very good, nothing is good', and that the use of him is 'like a cattle' and that he is 'excluded by the sectarian'. He said that the political liar Li Wan-ming was able to climb to such high positions as a result of the party's blind worship of party members. He also insulted workers and farmers and said that 'industrial and peasant cadres are massively incompetent and rely on their qualifications to eat.' He shamelessly dressed himself as a 'warrior' to attack the leadership cadre of workers and farmers. He said that the image of workers and peasants in the film was 'worthless,' and he himself admitted that 'holding a belly grunge to the workers and farmers cadres.' \\nNimsin has also consistently hated the revolutionary discipline of the army, distorting freedom of the press. He constantly claims to people that 'the army is not free, the army is special' and that 'the army has more rules and regulations, and the ideological constraints are large, cannot be arbitrary.' He hated that the Xinjiang Daily and Military Region newspapers did not publish his statements at the intellectuals and literary workers colloquium, and did not publish his paintings that deprecated the image of the People's Liberation Army, saying 'this is a restricted press.' \\nMany comrades revealed his true face at the meeting. He was a landlord, capitalist family origin. Before liberation, he was the team leader of the Sanqing team, compiled the school's publication 'Sea Breeze', and actively develop Samqing team members and monitor progressive students. He was praised by the reactionary authorities for his reactionary activities and became a member of the KMT in 1948 when the National Party merged with the Three Youth League. Before fighting against the rebellion, he often provoked dissension with some politically unclear people. Nynsin has been hiding his many reactionaries before and after his liberation, and many comrades questioned him: Are people like you really fighting wrong? Comrade Zhai Zhian exposes: Ning Xin peeks his own dossier in 1953. One morning in November 1955, Ning Xin took the opportunity to crack into the protection section, opened the locker, and stole six kinds of investigation materials about him. People angry geology asked him: Who is turning the box down, in violation of the Constitution? (The Liberation Army newspaper, August 24, 1957)\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"}

After liberation, Niu Jianxia left for me to work with the Southwest Salt Management Bureau. At the same time, he was arrested and sentenced to 11 years in prison for corruption and major political issues, and his mother threw suicide. \\nNiu Jiazi is a descendant of a reactionary bureaucracy. Before liberation life was extremely privileged, he called for a slave handmaid and lead the parasitic life of a bureaucr After liberation, he hated the PLA very much, believing that it was these people who destroyed his 'happy life'. When some PLA lived in his house, he remembered the story of the killing of tartars on 15 August, and he wanted to use this method to reach out to the families and kill the PLA living in them. \\nAfter attempting to mix into the army, he entered the theater team of Yucai School in Chongqing. In 1951, the Theatre Unit was suspended and participated in the experimental drama troupe of Southwest People's Arts College. The motivation for participating in the revolution is that there is no other way to go, and only then there is a way out. 'The cause of the revolution can also be used as a tool for becoming famous.' \\nNiu Jiazi participated in the revolution, with a unique class hatred, hatred I was responsible for comrades sitting in a car. 'Before liberation, my car was better than this beautiful mile,' he said. This time the Repertory Theatre team went to Zigong to perform. He specifically called Xie Mingde (small group members), to photograph the residence he had lived before liberation, leave it for a memorial, and see if those people were living. \\nFrom an early age, Niu Jiazi has been contaminated with a strong bourgeois individualistic thought. While still studying at school, his father taught him: 'Individualism is the nature of man.' And for example: 'Several people eat a plate of peanut rice, and we must all choose to eat big. But when a person gets a point, they eat the little ones first.' Therefore, from an early age to develop delicious lazy, extremely selfish vices. In the revolutionary team, he was very despised for labor and did not want to lift things, thought that it was 'inferior' to do it. He also believed in destiny, saying: 'A person's good life, no effort will be good.' He went to touch his hand to see if he had a future in theatre. His life creed is: 'Like to live a corrupt life, don't get up in the morning, don't sleep at night, all day tour, eat and drink.' 'There is wine today drunk', 'boat to the bay head natural straight', 'the sky no road'. But how can it be achieved in a new society? So he felt that after liberation was not as good as before. \\nIn 1952, his father was arrested for embezzlement and major political issues and sentenced to 11 years' imprisonment. As a result, his mother committed suicide, and he was more hateful to the party, but he was disguised well in appearance, deceiving the trust of the leaders and the masses, and became a general member of the regiment and anti-activist. At the beginning of the liberation, his real face was exposed, thinking that the time had come for revenge and hate. On the one hand, together with other members of the small group, ignited the masses and fought to attack the party.

In a letter to a man, he said, 'There is only one idea now that is to prepare for the central (?), Contact me anyway, I hope to disregard a war! And I personally spared no effort.' \\n...\\nAt the beginning of the liberation, small groups made estimates of the political situation throughout the country. Think: 'The Communist Party is unlucky!' 'The world is going to change!' Niu Jiazi said: 'Now intellectuals have not gone with the Communist Party, workers are troubled, and farmers are not happy to take the road of cooperation. Most of the Communist Party has become corrupt, and the Party is not in a position to do so. The corruption of the Communist Party is first, and the wind is secondary. This time many fundamental policies need to be changed, democracy and freedom should be expanded, and literary and artistic policies should be changed. The contradictions with the counter-revolution need to be transformed from a contradiction between the enemy and me into a conflict within the people America's Fast has rebels, and world communism is at a low tide.' ...\\nChongqing right-wing speech selection series fifth episode /internal document, for reference only for the reference of leaders, do not externally and reprint' September 1957"}

The right can be corrected, not the right can't rectify it, so they have complained that they all came into the labor force because of the great anti-right movement, hoping to be in the ranks of the right, and even fought to wear the right hat. After a long break, except Xu Bingquan has passed away, I don't know how to deal with it, the rest of the colleagues have received the brilliant gift of the Party to restore their honor, resume their duties and restore their wages 20 years ago. As for youth, nature is not recoverable anymore. \\nIn 1957 or 1958, according to three years, re-education through labour should be lifted in 1961. The release of re-education through labour is no longer called a re-education through labour force, but it cannot leave the unit without permission, the economic treatment is unchanged, and political treatment is to change the name 'employed person'. By 1966, the seven persons in the Technical Section had been detained by the dictatorship authorities for a total of eight and nine years. That day, at least half an hour before working time, I rushed into the office, in a hurry, because I needed to complete the design and drawing of the sand mixer as soon as possible. The general picture has been drawn, I open the drawing and thinking, looking at a part, think about what else needs to be done. \\nSix other colleagues have come successively, and a busy day is about to begin. At this time the tweeter on the outside pole suddenly sounded the broadcast: 'All the people gathered at 8:30 to the auditorium for a meeting.' \\nWhat is the urgent thing? \\nIn recent months, the Cultural Revolution has been in full swing, exposing the 'three villages' and criticizing the 'Yanshan Night Talk'. The louder the slogan 'angry whatsoever...' 'Destroy...' 'Sweep everything...' The hat of the 'cattle ghosts' flies, do not know who will fall on the head one day. The leaders of Beijing, including Deng Tuo, Wu Han and Liao Mosha, have become anti-party gangs. It is hard to understand that senior cadres of the Communist Party such as Peng Zhen, Luo Ruiqing, Lu Dingyi and Yang Shangkun became reactionaries that usurp power overnight. \\nAlthough the re-education through labour unit is closed, from articles published in the newspapers, these groups held in proletarian dictatorship cages also predicted that China's 9.6 million square kilometres of land would have set off a political storm, with a menacing momentum and a fierce degree of intensity as opposed to 1957. Right motion. \\nIn 1957, Mao Zedong opened a knife to democratic parties and intellectuals in order to preserve one-party dictatorship. Now, the party's top leaders and founding fathers are intending to protect the widowhood dictatorship. \\nThe immortal fought, and the people suffered. Millions more will be put into jail, and tens of thousands will die. \\nThe more sensitive people seem to see the impending disaster and the slim personal future. Examiner Li Xinggui died by electric shock, electrical maintenance worker Lai Peirong took poison, technician Xu Bingquan tried to commit suicide, and Li had committed suicide with a knife (after rescue). In a short period of time, several successive suicide incidents have added to this place of re-education through labour. \\nTwo arrest conferences were held in June and July. Seven eight people, including Yu Hongxi, Zuo Xiang, Zhu Yuanshan, etc., were arrested. The Sichuan Fire Machinery Factory was killed at a time, and everyone was at risk, and the atmosphere of panic and disturbed was growing. \\nI was not desperate at that time, but also had illusions about Mao Zedong and the Communist Party. \\nIn May, I and Li Shihui went into the marriage hall after three years of love, and her marriage leave expired, she only returned to Shaping Farm in Ebian County, Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province. I also look forward to a better future. For the stability of small families, I decided to rely on technology to eat later, no longer care about national events, but also to stay away from politics, just want to spend a peaceful day with my wife. I have not done anything that violates the law, and I follow the rules and cramped my tail in accordance with the requirements of the Communist Party, nor will it be my turn to a big political storm. \\nAt 8:30, more than 400 re-education through labour were forced to remain in places of re-education through labour and continue to undergo rehabilitation in places of rehabilitation, crowded with the 'auditorium'. \\nUsually such a conference is presided over by Zhou Yigui or Zhang Yuxin, Chief of the Corrections Unit. Today, Wang Wei, director of the workshop, was replaced. Often it is factory director Zhang Zhichao speech, today replaced with people who do not know, is said to be the head of the factory working group. Regardless of who he is, people try to kill me for fish and meat. In exchange, they are the police officers of the labor reform team, the tools of the proletarian dictatorship. We are 'second-class citizens' and dictatorship objects. \\nThe meeting began, and Wang Wei said loudly: 'Today is the assembly of 'anti-transformation elements' Niu lihua to arrest the criminals Niu lihua! \\nI then stood up, and I didn't know when four heavily armed men appeared behind me, escorted me to the side door of the 'Auditorium', did not read out the arrest warrant and did not let me sign, but inexplicably ruthlessly handcuffed me by an armed police force. \\nI stood at the door of the auditorium, closed my eyes and breath a long breath, calmed my emotions, then opened my eyes and looked around, a place where I had suffered mental and physical torture for seven years, where I used to endure the grievances to be understood and appointed. Research technology is looking forward to the opportunity to work for the motherland, I used to prepare for it Two physical and chemical labs place, it's going to say goodbye. \\nI am worthy of my heart, to the people, to the country. I'm going to go out of this door with my head high, not to lose my head, let alone whisper. \\nSuddenly, Correctional Officer Dai Fuqing came to the side. He weighed me up and down with his innumerable eyes, and I drove my eyelids and looked at the ground when I met with his eyes. \\nAfter about two minutes, I saw him walking towards the armed police, whispering what he said. After about two minutes, the armed police came in front of me and opened the handcuffs with a special key and loosened two buckles, and then I realized that both hands were already swollen. \\nI looked at Dai Fu Qing, and he turned around and saw his back slowly moving, moving, gradually moving away. \\nPassed my armed police ordered: Go! I turned left out of the narrow lanes next to the auditorium, to the main road in the factory, not far in front of a middle jeep. \\nI did not slowly walk forward, looking back, four armed police with guns tightly followed in the back. They were not on the shoulders of guns, but rather with bayonets, a Japanese devil into the city in a position. In addition to the handcuffs, Wen Weak books born in their opinion seem to be martial arts extraordinary rival, I hummed with my nose involuntarily. \\nWalked, opposite a familiar face, usually no interaction, but each other knew that they were re-education through labor workers. He walked more than a meter away from me and sent the word 'take care' with the movement of airflow and lips. I did not let the vocal cords vibrate and answered the two words 'rest assured.' The sound is small but I believe he can hear it. Unfortunately, I don't know the name of this hard friend, but remember just as if he was a turner who has not seen him again for more than 40 years now. \\nOn the inside of both iron railing and with military green canvas covered by a strict solid car, driving only ten minutes, the car stopped. \\nI got off the car and the sun outside was a little shaking eyes. Look up, the car parked in a relatively secluded alley, facing an iron fence door, went in the door for a moment, escorted my armed police opened the handcuffs, I had two hands carrying a small luggage roll standing. Two people come out from the inside, in the next communication room to check in the handover procedure, and then drink order: go! \\nThe two men dressed in police uniform did not carry a long gun, it was unknown whether there were short guns, one in front of the road and one in the back. When I left Ningxia Street Detention Center in October this year, I deliberately counted a number. From the entrance to the penthouse, I had to go through eight doors, which need to pass through the two doors of the kitchen, the security is strict and amazing, it must be difficult to go to the youth. \\nLater I heard that Ningxia Street really ran away. The unresolved prisoner (which should actually be called a criminal suspect), was flexible in mind, agile movement, bold superman. He was put forward by the armed police at the detention centre, standing under the wall and waiting for interrogation, saw a bicycle and a hat, a movement of spirituality, put the hat on cover the bald head, pushed up the bike swinging, even several doors, and no one asked. It was said that when the gate came out, he was also said to have nodded with the guard on the station. Bye! Successfully went with impunity. \\nI went to a yard with the dry police who led the road, which was not small in size, about 40 meters long and more than 20 meters wide enough to accommodate a thousand people. The three sides of the yard can see the red brick wall of more than 5 meters high, with the grid on the corners of the yard a watchtower that is higher than the fence. \\nHigh walls within the sun, quiet lake, can not hear a hint of wind and water, the bustle of the provincial city actually has such a treasure area suitable for meditation! \\nFour bungalows vertically arranged in the right hand direction, probably the prison house. The iron fence gate in the middle of the building is facing the open yard. The police officers took me to the door of the second building, on three steps, along a meter-wide roadway, and on both sides of the roadway were single rooms. The pace of the police was fast, I also accelerated the speed, went to the penultimate stop. \\n'Throw out what's on your body!' He ordered to say. Summer wear not many clothes, turned all the pockets and pants, only pulled out 17.25 yuan, he said: the money temporarily kept, what about watches? I said: I don't have a watch, he looked at it was empty hands and no longer asked. \\nThe next step is to let me take the belt down. I don't know what this is. But have to obey, solve the belt and do not know where to put, hold in the hands of hesitation, look up, outside the building there is a hook on the wall, there are already several belts above, so I put my pants belt hanging up. \\nHe took out the key, opened the iron lock, opened the iron bolt, hard to open the heavy wooden door, did not speak, rushed me with a mouth, I know it was let me in, my forefoot just stepped into the prison, the back foot was still hanging in the air, only heard when the wooden door was tightly closed, almost hit my heel. \\nImmediately after a bang, pulled over the steel bolt, click a sound, good iron lock. \\nIn this deep courtyard, quiet lanes, dang, whistle, click appear so prominent, shocked, shocked. \\nSecond, 17 Prison House\\nI went to formal jail for the first time and was curious. First standing inside the door, up and down around a tour, said a sound: Oh, this is the prison ah. \\nThis is a square house of three meters long and wide, both sides are a brick wall to the top, the right wall is affixed to a 'supervision discipline', facing the back wall of the door open a window, but 0.7 meters wide, but 0.5 meters high, and the household is different, this window is very high, two meters away from the ground, Above to approach the ceiling of the roof up. The window is lined with seven thumb thumb thumbs upright inside, and opaque glass outside. Looking back at the door, completely solid wood, gives a very thick and heavy feeling, the door has a horn-shaped peek hole wrapped in galvanized iron, inside can not see the outside, you can see inside. The rooms are covered with wooden floors, wiped out very dry. Twelve people sitting next to the wall root, the door next to the corner of the wall is placed a toilet with a lid, the lid is stacked with a half water basin. \\nThe person sitting at the door shouted with a relatively gentle voice: 'Sit down!' Several roommates on the wall moved their body and freed up an empty place, and I was squeezed there. \\nImmediately swept a circle with gaze, 9 square meters inside the house crowded 12 roommates face no expression, no motionless. \\nThe one who was at the door again said: 'What is your name?' Speaking of taking out a book to prepare the record, it seems that it is about a team leader or room director, and later knew that in Ningxia Street called 'Convening'. I answered: 'Niu lihua', he immediately wrote 'Liu' in the book, Sichuan accent cattle (niu), Liu (liu), no distinction, surname Liu is much more than the surname cattle, generally listened very easily to think of Liu. I took a look and immediately corrected and said, 'Not Liu, it is a cow.' Follow the elongated voice a word saying: 'Cow-ghost-snake-god-cow.' At this time, a few sitting around the handsome laughed, some cluttered their mouth with their hands. \\nThe 'call' meticulously laughed, said a voice: then learn. A roommate in glasses sitting across from me picked up an old newspaper and read it with eyes. That was the editorial of the People's Daily on June 1, 1966, titled 'Sweeping All the Ghosts and Snakes.' \\nThis article is the first editorial published by Chen Boda after he took over the People's Daily. It was written and revised by Mao Zedong approval. I have read dozens of times. Some of these languages are very 'sophisticated'. \\nThe original excerpt reads as follows: 'The fundamental problem of the revolution is that of regime, in all spheres of superarchitecture, ideology, religion, law, art, regime and, most importantly, regime. With the right, there is everything. Without the right, you lose everything. Therefore, the proletariat, after taking power, should never forget the regime, do not forget the direction, do not lose the center. Forgetting the regime is to forget politics, forget the fundamental view of Marxism, become economism, anarchism, ephinism, and that is the Hutu people. \\nMarx is a philosopher who studies the economy, absorbing the achievements of his predecessors (German classical philosophy, British classical political economics, French imaginary socialism, and so on). Its doctrine is popular and spread of Hereafter, although there is no shortage of fallacies, it still occupies a certain position in the field of social sciences. His hometown of Trier, Rhein province, still has the Marx Museum to commemorate his contribution. Marx's criticism of capitalism and all the authoritarian systems that have existed in human history, including the early anti-humane exploitation of capitalism and the alienation of money supremacy, is positive. To be sure, Marx spoke of class struggles and proletarian dictatorship, whose main thrust is to create a fantasy equal society free of oppression, no exploitation, and highly productive. Not only Marx is a person who has such fantasy in ancient times and today, but China has said more than 2,000 years ago that 'the world is public', 'the world is common' and 'the world's common'. In modern times, Kang has also been strongly advocated by Sun Yat-sen. \\nBut in this article, 'Sweeping all the cattle ghosts and snakes', Marx's fundamental view has been misinterpreted out of context as simply seizing power by violence. The believers who call Marx Chen Boda and Mao Zedong have swept Marxism over again, making great alteration and profanity. \\nThe beauty of this article is that it is indeed the true thought of Mao Zedong. Throughout Mao Zedong's day from entering politics to his death, all his thinking and all his energies are not used in the struggle for power. They are all for the sake of authoritarian dictatorship. Zheng, death must also be determined by his successor, in an attempt to let his wife Jiang Qing and his nephew Mao Yuanxin Take charge of power, and even want to let Tongfang Big Girl Zhang Yufeng into the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee. Mao Zedong often speaks to the world of Qin Shihuang, the home of the Qin Shihuang, the 'Party for the public', 'ruling for the people', 'serving the people', 'democratic freedom', 'revolution is liberation of productivity', 'revolution is promoting productive development' and so on are slogans and lies to fool and deceive the people. Right! Right! Right! It is Mao Zedong's goal of chasing his life. The starting point and fate of all his actions are bloody rights words. History has proven that history will certainly further prove that Mao Zedong's reversal is self-destructing reputation and self-digging graves, and the result is bound to be the opposite of his subjective wishes. \\nI did not recognize this in 1966, when Mao Zedong was almost worshiped, and more than 40 years of historical facts taught me that there was a sense of decision. \\nLies apply only to things that do not happen, in the future. In the face of real facts, and in the face of history that has passed, lies can only be a shameful record of liars and will surely be left out for many years. \\nWe were still reading the newspaper. Suddenly we heard the footsteps, and a roommate sitting opposite me quietly heard, he said: Wen Wu Zhang. I didn't understand what it meant, a rally, the door of the prison was opened. Outside the door, this man pointed his finger at the roommate who just read the newspaper and said, 'You come out!' He stood up, raised his glasses, put on shoes in the aisle at the door, followed the people. \\nI asked indiscriminately, 'What are you doing?' Just said, 'Wen Wu Zhang' the roommate took the initiative to answer: 'It is not like a reminder, Wen Wu Zhang has more things.' I went on to ask, 'The cadre's last name?' 'No, his surname Zhang, Wenwulu police sent over,' he quickly replied. I said, 'Oh,' and then asked, 'Your last name?' He said, 'No expensive, surname, Hengxiaoquan.' He also took the initiative, 'The officer who sent you in the name of the officer, the chapter of the early chapter.' I understand that this is the case. The surnames of the two officers have the same pronunciation, for the sake of distinction, called Wen Wu Zhang, who was transferred from the Wenwu Road police station, called the early chapter. Hengxiaoquan also told me that the person who was shouted out was also named Zhang Min. \\nSpeaking, there was a sound of footsteps outside, and the people in the building immediately did not speak, had a good body, and put up a decent look. The door opened, Zhang Min is back. This Wenwu Zhang said to me, 'You come out!' I was ordered to stand up, mention the pants, pull a little tightly, and then wear shoes, followed the officer walking along the roadway, while walking on one side, there are ten buildings on each side of this prison lane, a total of 20 on both sides. I am on number 17. \\nOut of the lane, turn right down the steps to the right is a cadre's office. I went in with Officer Zhang. \\nHe sat on a rattan chair and asked me to sit on a small bench, and he said, 'What have you done in?' He was very fierce and speeched. \\nI thought, I just went to jail for a dozen minutes. I didn't do anything? So the answer is truthfully. \\nZhang also asked, 'What did you say?' \\nI thought back, what did I say? Immediately replied, 'I didn't say anything.' \\nHe said with great anger, 'You are honest, come in and not be honest, see how to pack you up.' \\nAgain, I replied: 'Report Officer Zhang, I really didn't say anything.' \\nHe stare at me and said, 'What do you say?' \\nI don't have to be funny, oh, it turned out to be very careful in jail talking. I said to him without panicking, 'The prisoner at the door asked me what my surname, I said the cow of the god of the cow.' \\n'Why should you say that?' He's still a menacing look. \\nI said, 'Originally a cattle of cattle, but I can't say, if I say, I will be afraid to make mistakes. The old scalpers of the revolution describe the old cadres, are they not beautifying themselves. I was swept into jail, the god of the cow, so it was the cow of the god of cattle.' After I finish, secretly look at his expression. \\nHe listened, stunned for a while, as if he could not catch anything, also bad on the line, so in the mouth of the lesson warned me, into jail to strictly abide by the discipline, honest, confess from wide, resist from strict...\\nI nodded, thinking about dealing with the devil is not easy, talking, walking should be careful, everywhere there is a fine rape, just a sentence may be on the line. \\nHe stood up and said, 'Go back!' I immediately got up, one hand carrying pants, a hand swinging in front of him and went back to the building, the door was not locked, I pulled the bolt and opened the door and walked in. It was again, whistling, click, this time is not so bad. \\nGo back to the prison house and continue reading the newspaper. People who read are very serious, people who listen do not care, stay inside always want their own things. \\nAfter a while, I heard a ringing in the roadway, which prison door was opened, followed the mess of footsteps, a group of people had gone and ran. One roommate said, 'Let's go! Get rid of hands!' \\nI feel strange, why not come to the toilet in the air, rather than in the building? Stinky baked. \\nRoommates told many things to pay attention to the wind, and the rules passed down in this house. \\nPut the wind on the back of the yard, only ten minutes, wash your face, brush, hand off, pour toilet, washing clothes, exercise body, breathing fresh air, etc., must be done in ten minutes, very nervous. There are fewer squats in the toilet, more than twenty people let out to solve their hands, inevitably have to line up, delay time, the pioneers of the 17th building come out of the way out is to seize before releasing the wind, arrange two people each day to pour the toilet, one person wipe the floor, the rest can do each thing after going out. This fine tradition continues to this day. \\nUsually put the wind from the No. 1 prison building, the left side of the lane is single number, on the right is double number, put two buildings at a time. As for the two buildings to put their wind together, cadres decide on a temporary basis. Today is the 1st and the 2nd. Tomorrow will be the 1st and the 4th, and the day after tomorrow is the 1st and the 6th, and the day after tomorrow it is the 1st and the 8th. This is done to avoid collusion between the premises. I thought that the theoretical probability was 19 days to repeat it once. \\nPrisons are managed carefully and carefully. Previously, when communist members were in prison, they often used the opportunity to convey information. Now they were in power and became prison managers, and they wanted to block the road to those in prison. High! \\nToday's turn to wipe the floor roommate began to work, he picked up the rag wet in the basin, first wiping the door, and then from the root of the wall seriously and responsibly wipe the floor, wiping to whom, who will take the initiative to pick up a bunch of small coverings to free up his room, nine square meters will soon be wiped. \\nIt will take about an hour and a half to our turn on the 17th. Waiting for the wind this time is the easiest time in the building, without reading the newspaper, no need to sit in danger, 13 people in these nine square meters of small space can walk freely in. The five roommates in the building stand next to a child's hands, the toilet is about half a meter in diameter, and half a meter high, neither can squat nor sit, only two hands on the barrel to a horse squatting crotch, well that most Chinese people are familiar with Taijiquan. Everyone is accustomed to the common,See no blame。 \\nThe roommate also told me that water can only be used when you put the air, you can wash dishes, take a bath, and wash clothes. It is the turn of 'early chapter' on duty, regardless of the idle, if 'Wen Wu Zhang' on duty, need to pay attention to not talk to others, otherwise you will be scolded or even cancel your wind. \\nFinally it is the turn of our premises to let the wind, today is 'early chapter' on duty, after opening the door, let the two roommates carrying the toilet first out, wipe the floor end of the basin followed, the remaining ten people gradually out of the lane, to put the wind place. \\nNingxia Street Detention Center these four parallel penitentiaries are straight-through, each building has iron fence doors at both ends of the lane, front door facing the large yard, out of the back door is a narrow courtyard. Usually both ends of the iron fence doors are locked, put the wind, the front door closed lock, the back door opens. The width of the small yard is only about five meters, opposite and left to block a high wall grid, under the high wall there is a rectangular cement tank with four taps, the length of the yard is 30 meters, the right is a convertible toilet, only roof, no wall and partition, easy to watch at a glance. Next to the toilet there is a 10-square-metre bath room, which has no other facilities except for a rubber water pipe towed on the ground. \\nTwo houses put the wind together, that is, twenty-seven people, I saw, the two roommates washed the toilet tightly with a bamboo brush, flushed three water, called meticulous, and more abou"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "t hygiene than the food processing factory specialties of China in the 21st century. There are four squats in the toilet, there are still seven or eight hard friends waiting for the shit, if the solution of a stool takes three minutes, the last one has to wait at least six minutes, ten minutes of ventilated time will go for more than half, I have to think of the rules set by house 17 really bright and great. I washed my face in the cement tank, and I walked and looked back and forth in the yard. In the bath room there are five people off the fine light flushed with cold water, the space in the yard is only seven or eight people left, a big tall man standing at the door of the penthouse against the back of the wall and frowned his head motionless, stagnant gaze, beside no one. The rest stretched in the small yard, breathe deep, and kicked the chest. I suddenly remembered a Soviet song that was popular in China in the 1950s, 'How vast our motherland is, she has countless fields and forests. We have not seen any other country, so free to breathe...'\\nA whistle rings, put the wind to the end. The toilet was brought back, and the end came a basin of clean water, still stacked on the toilet lid. All 13 people returned to the premises, 'early chapter' came to count the number of people, and then was dangdang, whistle, click. \\nBack in the house, everyone sat in turn, or came up with the newspaper that published 'Sweeping All Cow and Ghost Snake God', read by one person there. There were no clocks and no tables in the building, and it was impossible to figure out what time it was, estimated at 11:30. The roommate said, 'Let's cook, and then tell me the rules of eating. There are still three meals in prison, 7 two food quantification a day, 2 two dry rice in the morning, 3 two dry rice at noon, 2 or two porridge at night, basically did not eat meat. Each person every day about a pound of vegetables, fresh vegetables moisture content is relatively high, radish, cabbage and other water content are above 90 percent, the water content of mung bean sprouts up to 95 percent, after boiled, fried, removed a part of the water, may only half a pound, half a kilogram of vegetables divided into three meals, each meal You can only spread out a little bit. A small bowl of rice, a handful of dishes lacking oil and salt is the most hearty lunch. \\nA whooping, is the sound of the iron fence door open. One roommate said the meal was coming. Otherwise, follow the sound of the iron car, Hengxiaoquan stood up, went to the door, put the nose close to the door seam inhale vigorously, said a sound: 'fried mung bean sprouts.' About half an hour passed, the car that delivered food was only pushed to building No. 17. We had already lined up the line inside, and I was in the last row. Everyone holds two bowls in their hands, I have only one enamel cylinder. The door opened, handed the bowl next to the order, a cook dinner, a cook Sheng dish, I said that it was only today, I wanted a bowl, a pair of chopsticks. Today's dish is really green bean sprouts, Hengxiaoquan's nose true spirit. \\nWe sit in their position, although the stomach is hungry, but reluctant to swallow, only this meal, three or two to eat seems to be a little lacking, so slowly sentiments a bite to enjoy, Sichuan called tasting, a bite of rice to chew dozens of things to swallow, this is really chewing slowly Pharynx, in accordance with the requirements of doctors and nutritionists. \\nEat a nap and continue to study at 2:30pm. Said it is nap, most are not asleep. 9 square meters sleep 13 people, head and feet are also very squeezed, good in everyone all day bare feet, do not wear shoes, no smell on the feet, I know 'people at the beginning, feet do not smell'. That taste is from shoes and socks. \\nMorning reading of newspapers and in the afternoon is a discussion and a statement. \\nIII. THREE\\nIn 1954, the People's Republic of China promulgated the first Constitution. \\nArticle 85 states: 'All citizens of the People's Republic of China are equal in law'. \\nArticle 87 states in an informative manner: 'Citizens of the People's Republic of China shall have freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, procession and demonstration. The State provides the material facilities necessary to guarantee the enjoyment of these freedoms by citizens.' \\nWith regard to court trials, article 76 states: 'People's courts shall hear cases in public except in special circumstances provided by law. The accused shall have the right to a defence'. \\nArticle 78 makes it clear: 'People's courts shall conduct independent trials and are subject only to the law'. \\nI was arrested in 1966, before going through the Communist Party's obsession, coercion and manipulation of the masses, a 'anti-right' campaign that took out of context, distorted and fabricated, indiscriminate, and arbitrarily cluttered hats, and suspected of sending people without investigation, unverified, indefensible, not even a single legal instrument. Reeducation through labor to the dictatorship organs, but because of the fact that the Communist Party was at the time The fascist nature is not yet clear, and there are illusions that the courts will always act according to the law, so I took a low-key compromise gesture during the trial. \\nI am full of thinking that the judicial authorities will be able to effectively investigate, try them seriously and take legal issues seriously, but the actual situation is greatly anticipated. \\nIn accordance with the statutory procedure, the general interrogation process should include the following steps: (1), the Public Security Bureau pretrial, where the defendant confirms all the facts of the crime at the pre-trial, or writes its own opinion on the pre-trial record; (2), the Public Prosecutor's Office examines, verifies the pre-trial materials and confirms whether the prosecution is prosecuted; (3), confirmation of the prosecution. prepare the indictment after the indictment and send a copy to the defendant to prepare him for his defence; (4), In accordance with the law, public hearings and sentences were pronounced. \\nHow was the interrogation actually? \\nI was arrested on 12 July 1966. On the morning of 14 July 1966, Huang Liding, a examining magistrate of the Public Security Bureau, said that it took only a few minutes to ask the name, age, origin, and different cases, and so on. \\nMore than a month later, the formal pre-trial was not held until 18 August. This time a pre-trial officer was replaced and a clerk was added. \\nDuring the interrogation, I generally did not argue on issues that differ from the facts, but are not marginal, but only to give the necessary explanations for alleged allegations that are unfounded or reversed. \\nAt the end of this trial, I saw that the records were incomplete, even large discrepancies in some places, and could easily be misunderstood and requested for additions and corrections. The examining magistrates were very disgust. I had just written a few words, and he was extremely impatient, and fortunately the clerk had asked me to continue writing, which allowed me to make a brief addition to individual issues. In order not to cause greater dissatisfaction among the pre-investigators, many mistakes in the record were not effectively prosecuted. \\nI think this is the first pre-trial, and the interrogator only asked a few topics, without in-depth questions, and it is inevitable that it will be interrogated in the future. Since it is certainly necessary to clarify all the facts on a case-by-case basis, it can be left to the final determination upon completion of the pre-trial case. \\nAnyone knows that after this pre-trial there is no further trial, and the necessary step to close the pre-trial case has been omitted, the steps taken to review and verify the material by the Public Prosecutor's Office, and the indictment has not been issued to the accused before appearing in court. It was a sudden official appearance on September 7. \\nThe court was inside the prison district of Ningxia Street, from the 17th cell where I was in, through a long lane and three iron gates out of the compound yard yard, another yard outside is a yard, the side is a wall of bricks of about five meters high, and a row of bungalows, about twelve, is the interrogation room.. The proposed criminal suspect faced the bricks standing under this high wall waiting for trial. \\nI stood under the wall for about 10 minutes and was escorted by prison guards to the interrogation room. \\nThe room is small, about 20 square meters, and the front is a wooden platform of about 25 cm tall, lined up with three desks, which is the position of the judge and jurors. In the middle of the open space there was a stool, which was the position of the accused, and I sat down after entering the door and found that the stool was fixed on the ground and could not move, and was intended to prevent the accused from bursting on the stool and beating the interrogators. \\nThe court consists of one judge and two people's jurors, the obese female judge sitting in the middle. On her left is a near-scarce, well-defined old man, and on the right is an old lady over a flower armor, short stature old lady standing at the door. \\nAt the beginning of the hearing, the indictment was read out as follows:\\nPeople's Procuratorate of Chengdu, Sichuan Province\\nindictment\\n(66), Prosecution indictment No. 027\\nDefendant Niu lihua, male, 30 years old, Han ethnic, Beijing, capitalist of family origin. In 1957 in Chongqing Yangtze River power plant rampant attack to the party was classified as the right, because of disobedience to supervision and reform, 1958 was sent to re-education through labour, in October 1961 removed the right hat, lifted re-education through labour, leaving Tonghui car repair factory employment so far. \\nDefendant Niu lihua, in the counter-revolutionary case, was arrested by the Chengdu Municipal Public Security Bureau on July 12, 1996 in accordance with the law, and transferred to the Court after the pretrial to examine the indictment. Upon examination it was determined that his criminal facts were as follows:\\nThe defendant Niu lihua, after the lifting of re-education through labour, has always insisted on the reactionary position. The extreme hate party and socialist system have viciously and systematically attacked the Party's policies and policies, slandered that 'the basic points of the implementation of the left under the three red flags have changed, and are still shouting long live the overall route' 'Great Leap Forward' 'The results are false...' attack, anti-right struggle said, 'Counterright expansion, make mistakes Hundreds of thousands of people, the case will not stop,' 'China is now delineated too many enemies, and revisionism will appear in the future.' 'I will commit suicide without revisionism in China.' \\nThe defendant also tried to stigmatize socialism, glorify the capitalist system, promote 'freedom' of the bourgeois, saying that 'today's society is not free.' Attacking Mao Zedong Thought is an inconsistency in words and deeds. 'Theoretically it is one set, what is done is another set', and slandering the proletarian cultural revolution 'is trying to criticize whoever and find which material. If you don't want to criticize which one, the problem is no longer big'. \\nThe defendant did not confess guilt because he was classified as right-wing, and since 1965 had often shouted to turn the case, saying, 'I want to go to the Central Committee', when other employed persons discouraged, said, 'I am not afraid of suffering, two are not afraid of death, three are not afraid of hot, willing to scratch, and dare to pull the emperor down the horse' and said, 'Since the Party sees me as an enemy, Think of me as grass mustard, I will see you as Kou Chou', reactionary flame is very ar \\nIn summary, the defendant Niu lihua has always insisted on the reactionary stance, viciously attacked all the Party's policies and policies, slandered the proletarian cultural revolution, arrogant clamor to reverse the case, causing an extremely bad impact among employed people. In accordance with the spirit of Article 10, paragraphs 1 and 3, of the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Anti-Revolution, it shall be punished according to law. \\ncǐzh\\nChengdu Xicheng District People's Court\\nAttorney General Chen Qingyun\\n26 August 1966\\nThis fat and fat female judge on stage finished reading the indictment in Chengdu dialect. A bailiff gave me a copy of the indictment. I looked at it from beginning to end, the feeling was:\\n(1), Not to be burned in anger, this indictment is extremely exhaustive, distorted and fabricated, incapable, non-rogue and rogue will not use such means, it is vile and shameless. Mao Zedong said: 'The world is afraid of being serious about the word. The Communist Party speaks the most serious'. How does the procuratorial office of the Communist Party of China not speak seriously? \\n(2), Confiscently pleased that these counts listed in the indictment are nothing more than a matter of rhetoric or a matter of thought, and there are no specific facts of the crime that, in accordance with the public policy, are not sufficient to sentence the sentence. \\nI calmed the mood and slowly said to the judge: 'The vast majority of the indictment is not true.' \\nShe said, 'Which point is not true?' \\nI replied, 'These first words, 'The defendant Niu lihua, male, 30 years old, Han, Beijing municipal people' is a fact. Then, 'The following, starting from family origin, is not a fact. My father is an accountant, or the director of accounting, has no capital. How can I call a capitalist? At most, it is a small bourgeois.' \\nThe old lady was very active and didn't wait for the judge to speak. She first said, 'The small bourgeois is a capitalist.' \\nThe fat female judge looked at her at a glance and made a move under the table with his right hand, not to let her mouth more. Then he said to me, 'What is your home?' \\nI replied, 'As far as I know, there is no division in big cities. Are you Chengdu people. Are you divided into Chengdu? No, right? Beijing is not divided either. If this is done, the local government will prevail, capitalists, landlords, or warlords, I all admit. If you don't draw, you can't write an ingredient arbitrarily.' \\nThe unsolitary old lady said another sentence: 'After liberation all have drawn ingredients.' \\nThe judge shook his head and flushed her hand. Since then, the old lady has never spoken again. \\nI was thinking that if the people really respected the people, respect the work of jury and respect people's jury, then people should be hired to serve as jurors with a certain level of culture, some common legal sense and ability to jury. The jury of different cases should be judged according to the different circumstances of the jurors, so that jurors may fully understand the circumstances of the case and become familiar with all issues in the interrogation process, so that they can play a jury role. If a jury seat is set up only in formal terms, but using the means to keep the jury from understanding the case, this is not only a joyce of serious jury work, but also an insult to the jurors. After the fact, I learned that the courts in the hands of the CCP did not need to take into account their cultural literacy, common sense of justice, jury ability when hiring jurors. Instead, from the list of strong military generals in the street offices, several old men and ladies whose families are financially constrained. For every time they participate in a jury, the court pays one yuan of labor. Fees, you can buy more than 8 pounds of rice, enough for a family to eat for two or three days, both take care of the strong army, and reduce the neighborhood committee Burdens of relief. Where is this jury!? It is simply a shade of blasphemy justice, fool the people, and deceive public opinion. is a specific product of one-party dictatorship, dictatorship."}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】Lin Yao: 'Button Badge: Every history is a touching story'\\n'Southeastern shape Sheng, Sanwu City, Qiantang since ancient times bustling.' Liu Yong's 'Wanghai tide' gives people a beautiful view of rich shu Jiangnan, where Huzhou on the southern shore of Taihu Lake, the 'Silk House, the hometown of fish rice, the state of relics' became a jewel of Jiangnan. Huzhou is one of the birthplace of world silk culture, silk factory, founded in 1918, Dachang silk factory, has been occupying a more important position in Huzhou. As the successor to the Dachang silk factory, the old generation of business and businessmen, former Standing Committee of the CPPCC, President of the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce Mr. Niu Shouzhang told us about his past. \\nShouldering the responsibility of revitalizing the home\\n'My career was developed in the succession of fatherhood.' Button Badge opens the door of memory, and fervently recalls the father's little bit by bit. \\nThe father of Niu Jiechen, born in 1888, is the founder of Dachang silk factory. He was 21 years old into Huzhou Laoduntai crêpe, 23 years old was promoted to Shanghai old Dun Tai when accounting. At the age of 25, given that silk was selling, good business, Buttonson left Laoduntai to do their own crepe dealer, trafficking crepe from Huzhou airport to Shanghai sales. From the age of 26, buttonhouse brothers three people partnered to open Hongsheng Changchu Zhuang, from a trader to a business, engaged in lake crepe shipping wholesale sales in Shanghai, thus accumulating capital for further development. \\nIn 1911, the buttonson brothers began to set up in the home to set up two handmade woven woven machines for family workshop production, and then increased to four, called 'button Dachang', self-produced. In 1918, in Xiaoxi Street Huilong Bridge partnership raised funds to expand 20 manpower looms. Since then, Huzhou Dachang factory gradually flourished, button home also began to develop. \\nAs a businessman, Niu Jiechen summed up a business warp of 'people without me, people have me fine, I am fine'. In the early years of the Republic, the main raw material of Lake silk was earthwork, which was made from rural family law. Due to the shabby equipment, silk stripe thickness, rough head, more broken head, must spend artificial shake, and low yield, quality times, it is impossible to weave finer, thinner high-grade silk satin. In order to strive for high and fine product development, Dachang silk factory determined to build its own silk factory, production of white factory silk, 1927, buttonhouse made in Deqing tiaoxi silk factory. However, after the outbreak of the anti-Japanese war, Japan, in order to compete for the silk market in the world and China, systematically and purposefully destroyed China's silk cause. As soon as they embarked on the fertile soil in the south of the country, they saw mulberry trees cut off and destroyed them. The Tiaoxi silk factory was demolished by the Japanese invaders, destroyed the plant, and looted several times. The pseudo-army bandits were fuelled by the bursting of fire, and the last fire burned light, rubble was lost. \\nIn 1946, the 22-year-old Buttonguang graduated from the Department of Business Administration at Shanghai Hujiang University, a choice of life is in front of this upright young man. He wanted to go abroad for further studies, but Nou Che asked his son to dispel this idea, because in this son, Nou Jiechen placed too much hope. \\n'In fact, I was already in the factory when I was studying. Under the supervision of my father, I studied in the morning and went to the factory in the afternoon, to write reports every day, work very hard.' The young button badge is not as laid-back and relaxed as other grandmen, strict father always reminds him to take on the responsibility of revitalizing his home and revitalizing the industry. 'My father will smoke and drink alcohol, but he never closes his mouth, and he smokes domestic alcohol from domestic cigarettes. What he said most to us was the suffering he suffered when he was an apprentice.' Perhaps it was the father's speech and so that it was his father's teaches, so many of the young people at the time were less hastolic, as his father was thrifty and diligent. \\nAt that time, Buttonhouse owned silk factory, silk factory, refinery, flour factory, factory in Huzhou, management office and sales point in Shanghai. The young buttonguard shoulders the hopes and aspirations of their parents, dedicated to the family business, learned a lot of business operation knowledge and practical experience. He thought he could learn and apply the expertise he has learned to practical work, but it is against his will. Inflation and currency devaluation caused by the corrupt rule of the Kuomintang have replaced normal operations. The turbulent situation made the Button Badge quickly in trouble, from 1946 to 1949 liberated, he struggled for three years, but the company was always in the midst of wind and rain. \\nMoved by two things in the Communist Party\\nOnce again, the father's choice affects the button badge. 'In the early days of the liberation war, some people advised my father to leave Shanghai to go overseas. My father was unmoved, and was determined to stay in the mainland to coexist with enterprises. He said to me that he was born from a young age, one was covered in Shanghai, and had eaten all the bitterness, started his own hands, did not do bad things. If the Communist Party wanted to liquidate, he could dedicate all enterprises to the country, and individuals could also continue to work for the country. My father also said that abroad is nothing more than being bullied in other countries, and domestic suffering is always born to have roots.' So far, the beaten button, which has passed the old years, still admires the father's choice. \\nHis father's perseverance has created confidence in the Button Badge, and he started to know the CPC from two first-hand experiences and saw a better future for the new China. The first thing was the day the PLA entered downtown Shanghai when he saw a neat row of PLA fighters living on Nanjing Road and Jinling Road pedestrians. At that time, the world was drizzle, after day and night marching, extremely tired fighters, rather risking the wind and cold, a street slept next to a street, many shop owners couldn't bear, persuaded them to go into the house to sleep, but there was no single warrior to disturb the common people. The second thing is the afternoon of the day after liberation, leaders such as the head of the Huzhou Municipal Military Administration Commission, municipal committee secretary, mayor and chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions came to the Dachang Silk Factory and the labor and labor parties to meet very late. At the end of the meeting, it was already lights, everyone was still hungry, and the day was raining. Several leaders did not. With rain gear, button badge to leave them for dinner, but not retained. But see they all took off their shoes, barefoot and ran back in the rain. At the door of the factory, the 'big officials' of the Communist Party left the back of the rain, admiration, was born. He was convinced that the Communist Party could not only destroy an old world, but also to build a new world. \\nThis speculation is corroborated by the facts. From 1949 to 1953, affected by the war, the domestic market of high-end consumer goods like silk tended to shrink, domestic sales very difficult, exports were blocked, several years of export interruption, products simply could not sell out, the entire silk industry suffered a very big blow. 'It was not useful to encourage the resumption of production at that time, because the things produced could not be sold, there was no money to buy raw materials or pay wages, and production was unsustainable.' At this moment, there have been several stormy buttons, peacefully, that the anxiety, restlessness and discomfort of the time were not seen. However, the button badge at that time was almost restless and sleepless, and he did not have any means to see the family that his father handed over to him at stake. At the same time, the government began to acquire its finished products, issue loans, and the factories also began to issue wages, and then export gradually, and then adopted various support measures of a national capitalist nature such as processing orders to help, and enterprises began to improve gradually. \\n'I sincerely thank the Communist Party, thank the government, pulled me in my most difficult time, and brought me spring life, otherwise my father created this family business...' \\nActively engaged in public-private partnerships\\nThrough continuous learning and practice, we have gradually realized that capitalist business and industry must undergo socialist transformation, the highest form of which is public-private partnerships. In the winter of 1954, his father Niu Jiechon personally participated in the first shareholders meeting after the public and private partnership in Huzhou Power Plant, and received the dividend distribution. He heard in the report of the public representatives the huge changes in the plant after the PPP. The case, the corruption of the power plant in the past, I know best. My shareholder has never received a penny dividend. I could not expect the Communist Party to make the power plant so good and pay dividends again.' He also attended the shareholders meeting of the PPP Dachang Su factory the following year, and he was surprised and happy that production had increased significantly after just two years after the PPP. \\nWhen it comes to public-private partnerships, Niu Shouzhan recalls one thing at the turn of the spring and summer 1954. It was the United Front Department of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held a symposium on public-private partnership work in East China, which was held at the Shanghai Jinjiang Hotel. At that time, it was 'Huangmei Day', when the big water flooded the highway from Huzhou to Shanghai. The representatives who went to Shanghai to attend the meeting, the then deputy director of the private side of the public-private joint venture Dachang silk factory, and the Bai-you Minister of the United Front Work Department of Huzhou Municipal Committee, as well as four representatives of the public and private joint venture Huzhou Power Plant and the director of the public and private sector, could only take a boat from Huzhou to Jiangsu Shengze, and then get on a car to Shanghai at 89:00 in the evening. Bell is up. Comrade Chen Yi, the mayor of Shanghai and deputy secretary of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, who was planning to make an important speech on the next day on the state policy on public-private partnership, had to rush to Beijing that night, so the speech was recorded in advance. The next day business representatives from East China heard a recording at the symposium. Speak. East China is a well-developed area of industry and commerce in China. Naturally, it is also the focus of public-private joint work. Representatives of industry and industry from all provinces and cities gathered in the Shanghai Communist Republic is, is a very important meeting, so the meeting has been very long and has been held for more than 10 days. In addition to listening to Comrade Chen Yi's important speeches, all regions also introduced first Take a step by step with the experience and problems of public-private joint ventures and around how to better advance the work (later shackdown (Zhang Cai learned that the conference was prepared for the 1956 industry-wide public-private partnership climax), the development of production, good public-private relations, and how to carry out the transformation of enterprises at the same time as the transformation of enterprises. \\n'At the meeting, I met Mr. Miao Hainan, a giant textile industry and big capitalist of Shandong. At that time, I was very young, did not know him. Someone introduced to know that he went to Hong Kong before liberation, and came back shortly after the Central Committee and the Shandong Provincial Committee. He is a man of integrity, progress in his ideas, and actively advocates the Party's various policies and measures to carry out socialist transformation of capitalist business and industry, and I pay great respect to him. I remember that he was very enlightened in a brand-new lake-blue tunic, and I was inspired to make a good speech at the meeting.' The minds of the Button Badge crossed time, recalling fragments of life more than 50 years ago. During the meeting, he and Mr. Miao Hainan were divided into a group for discussion, because his records were comprehensive. Mr. Miao used him to borrow a transcript of the important speech of the central leadership comrades and prepared to copy it in order to go back to study and convey. Button badge gave him a copy, and he was happy that they had not met again after the meeting. \\nIn the winter of 1955, a vigorous capitalist industrial and commercial public-private partnership climax began to form throughout the country, central and provincial and municipal levels 'two sessions' organizations (Civil Construction is a democratic party, the Federation is a social group of business enterprises, due to their members and objects Most of them are business people, and the tasks are basically the same, so they It was working together, referred to as the 'two sessions' until 1989.), Responding to the call of the Communist Party of China, under the leadership of the CPC Committee at all levels, actively mobilize its own members to this climax. As a model to take the first step, in 1954 already served as the deputy director of the PPP Dachang silk factory, and was pleased to be at the forefront of the march of the industry and industry, to welcome the upsurge of public-private partnership. Finally, the majority of business and businessmen responded to the party's call, surrendered production materials without exception, participated in public-private partnerships, and achieved a great victory in the transformation of capitalist industrial and commercial socialism. \\nLater for more than 20 years, it was another trough of his life. He was beaten as the right, and finally 'contradictions against us as internal contradictions of the people', he was treated with 'two categories'. \\nWitness the birth of Hong Kong Huzhou Associations\\nAfter the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee in 1978, the charges of the right wing were corrected. In June 1981, after the resumption of activities of the Minjian Huzhou Municipal Committee, he was transferred from the silk factory to Huzhou Municipal Committee work, in 1982 as the deputy chairman of the Minjian Huzhou Municipal Committee, 1986 as the chairman, Zhejiang Provincial Committee deputy chairman. In 1983, Jiaxing area was elected deputy director of the first and second NPC Standing Committee of Huzhou City after the withdrawal of the city. 'I have suffered more than 20 years of political grievances, but I have not shaken my faith in the party, because I understand that no political party, government or other regime organization in the world, whether capitalist or socialist, is not. May not make mistakes, and the key is to see how it corrects them. We often say that our party is a great, wise, right party, and that the reason it is great, wise and right, I think is reflected here.' \\nAt that time, the Central Committee called for greater opening up to the outside world. Cities such as Ningbo, Hangzhou, Wenzhou and other cities were at the forefront. Huzhou Municipal Committee should actively liaise with people of Lake nationality (especially the business community among them), in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and expand the influence of Huzhou among them. Together, the Municipal Committee's United Front Work Department mobilized Liu Shouguang and Li Chengwei Main Committee of Minger Huzhou Municipal Committee (deceased), together to contact Hong Kong under the name of a private family visit. Activities, Button Badge gracefully accepted this glorious task. At the age of 87, his father and matrimonial, Mr. Bo Ni Ping Sun made thoughtful arrangements for the visit of the button in the same way as his nephew. Over 20 days of stay in Hong Kong, under the referral of Mr. Ni Lao, the button has had contact with folks and friends over 100 times. Most of them belong to the middle and upper ranks of the business community, as well as prominent members of the press and publishing industry and intellectual circles, including Jardine Consultant Gan Lin, the old classmate of Nanyang Rong Yen's cousin, General Manager of Hong Kong Nanyang Yijen's cousin Rong Hongqing, Chairman of Hong Kong Book and Stationery Industry Association, General Manager of Litong Books Company Ying, Xu Huiyuan, general manager of Baofeng Insurance Company and silk counterparts Shen Binglin, Shen Shanchen, Shen Shanxun Kunzhong, etc. In addition, the button also met many new people, new friends including their children. Among them are the original owners of Huzhou Lujiayuan Lu Xinyuan descendants, now Hong Kong, the United States and Mauritius have more than ten wool textile mills Asian textile group Lu Zengyong, Lu Zengqi Kunzhong; Huzhou famous calligrapher Wang Yiting's grandson Wang Xiaozhi, Wang Xiaoxing, Wang Xiaoda, Wang Xiaofang, Wang Xiaoren and Wang Xiaoren five Kunzhong. \\nIn contact, he learned that Huzhou's compatriots, including their children, have no fewer than 2,000 people, but in Huzhou they have ancestral homes, ancestors and relatives, relatives, friends and often come back in Huzhou. However, hundreds of people, accounting for a minority, are of Huzhou nationality but have no ancestral residence, ancestor graves and no relatives or friends in Huzhou, as well as those of Huzhou origin, and later moved to Shanghai and then to Hong Kong and Macao from Shanghai , make up the majority. No matter which part of the people, they have strong feelings about their hometown Huzhou, they are concerned about the fate of their motherland and more about the rise and fall of their hometown. However, after all, they are living abroad for a long time and lack of understanding of everything in the mainland, and they are in different social systems, will inevitably generate some different views. More generally, there is fear of policy change. In particular, some people engaged in business and business fear of socialism against them after Hong Kong's return to the motherland in 1997. Makeover and much more. At the same time, Hong Kong nationals also reflect some practical problems, such as the implementation of private house retreats, and requiring children in mainland China to take over the cause of their parents in Hong Kong. After his return, Niu Guan has responded separately to the relevant government departments, received support and gradually resolved in accordance with the policy provisions, and was embraced by Hong Kong cysts. \\nWhen liaising with the older overseas compatriots, the button has found that it must also pay attention to doing their second and third generation work. The old generation of patriotic patriotism friendship is relatively deep, but most of them are old, their second generation, many people have achieved certain achievements in their careers, but hometown concepts are not as deep as their predecessors, and the third generation is even more so. Some of them even knew that their ancestors were Huzhou, but they didn't know where Huzhou was. In contact, the button also learned that Huzhou compatriots in Hong Kong do not always have the opportunity to contact each other. Therefore, he put forward the proposal to organize Huzhou hometown associations in Hong Kong, which has received the appreciation and support of the fellow citizens in Hong Kong and Huzhou. After more than four months of active preparation, on 7 June 1987, Huzhou Hong Kong Associations Inaugural Meeting was held at Pearl City Restaurant in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong. Mr. Ni Ping-sun was elected as the first president. Photos and articles on Huzhou's history and geography and terroir are often seen in newspapers in Hong Kong since then, which have expanded the influence of Huzhou among Hong Kong people. \\nOn June 25 of that year, Mr. Ni Ping Sun Lao travelled from Hong Kong to Hangzhou, to report to the provincial and Huzhou city leaders on the preparation and future intentions of the association, by the provincial overseas Chinese office and Huzhou municipal committee and municipal government leadership warm reception. At the end of June, Mr. Gu Ganlin led over 70 students, named after his father's uncle Pinggong, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the scholarship at the Daochang Mountain Cemetery in Huzhou. Mr. Shen Binglin, a Hong Kong manufacturing company, in addition to donating funds to build parks, nursing homes, secondary school science and technology museum, primary school teaching buildings, and rehabilitating hospital inpatient departments in Huzhou City, has also donated funds for the construction of welfare homes and bilang lake tingxie in Huzhou city. Mr. Lu Zengyong, general manager of the Asian-African Textile Group of Hong Kong, and two brothers Zengqi and Zeng Yu, have had little interaction with the Mainland in the past. Through this contact, they knew that their Lujia and Huzhou had a deep historical origin. \\nWith the joint efforts of Hong Kong and Lake Hong Kong's Huzhou Associations, the meeting has progressed gradually. Zhejiang Province and Huzhou city have repeatedly visited Hong Kong or held in the Mainland, all kinds of economic, trade and networking activities have been supported and helped by peasant associations. The first president, Mr. Ni Pingsun, due to his old age, settled back to mainland China in 1991, living in Shanghai, accompanied by his grandson and granddaughter-in-law for more than 10 years, died in 2001, aged 101. Yulong bearing equipment company operating in Hong Kong, Sun Ni Yongping, has moved to Guangzhou Panyu, and opened a branch plant in Shanghai. During his 10 years of residence in Shanghai, Mr. Ni has always traveled to visit Shanghai until the last moment of his life, despite the deep feelings of 'forgetting the years' from Huzhou. \\nFeel the sincere care of the old soup\\nIn 1989, after the civil construction, the Federation of Commerce and Industry Division, due to the need for work, reassigned to the vice president of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and was elected as the seventh, eighth and ninth National Committee of the CPPCC member. In 1997, he was President of the Provincial Federation of Commerce and Industry and was elected as Standing Committee of the Ninth National Committee of the CPPCC until retirement. \\nIn this history, individuals have left an indelible influence on the Button Badge. 'In order to transfer me to the province, Mr. Tang Yuanbing, then President of the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, did a lot of work, made many requests to the provincial committee. At the beginning of the transfer, Tang always asked me to focus my work on the provincial business and economic development company that I was also general manager. In order to facilitate good management of the company and save money, I gave up the treatment of cadres living in a new hotel and settled on the top floor of the company. In the middle of summer, the top floor was under strong sunlight, especially hot. At that time, air conditioning was not common, heat during the day, could not go out, and I had to sleep very late. Soup was very concerned, sent watermelon to the fifth floor of the company to cool me, and even sent his own gas tank to me. Time has passed nearly 20 years, the button badge is still clear to remember that moving scene: a drizzle night, Mrs. Tang Laojie Zhang Yuan and Ms. hold an umbrella, walk to the company on the fifth floor to visit the button badge, hush cold warmth. \\nIn life, Tang is as caring as a loved one's elders, but in thought, politics and work, Tang old as Yan Shi, the button's badge requirements are quite high. One time, Tang said his parting message to a leader of the Democratic Party who is about to raise the central government: 'The promotion of the post of a Democratic Party comrade is a matter of Party training, organizational arrangements, and work needs to be decided upon. There is one side of my own efforts, but can not be complacent by equating the promotion of the job and his existing quality and level. On the contrary, we should face up to their shortcomings, strive to overcome and make progress, in order to truly adapt to new jobs, to meet the expectations.' Soup always speaks this statement to the Button Badge to listen, in fact, an education on the button. After many years, so far sound in ear, the memory is fresh, unforgettable, so that the button badge lifetime inexhaustible. \\nThe Party attaches importance to and care about the healthy development of a private economy, and it can be seen in its treatment of the private economy in development, from the beginning of using it as a 'useful supplement' to a 'necessary supplement' to 'necessary supplement', from 'component' to 'important part' to 'important part' to written it into the Constitution in 1998; Economic entrepreneurs from the original non-admission to the party, as well as the establishment of private The right to property, and the honorable title given to them as builders of socialism, have been laid down, making political and legal clarity about the status of a private economy. This is the demand of the times and the progress of society. \\nDuring his participation in the meeting of the National Committee of the CPPCC in Beijing, Niu was interviewed by a reporter of the British BB Radio and Television Company. The reporter asked, at the beginning of liberation, you took the lead in applying for public-private partnerships, handing over enterprises to the state, and now actively supporting the country's development of private economy, what are the ideas? And is whether the state's policy of encouraging private enterprise development will change in the future? For the first question, Nou Shang felt that it should be seen that the party had different historical missions in different historical periods. Once the new China is established, the country should embark on large-scale economic construction, and first of all it must have a strong national economic base. Without the socialist transformation of the large number of capitalist businesses that existed at that time, it would be impossible for the country to embark on planned economic construction in a relatively short period of time, reviving the national economy, or the situation of prosperity and prosperity as it is today. Only if our national economy is strong and the country's comprehensive national strength has increased, can it be possible to propose a policy of 'developing a variety of economic components with the public ownership economy as the theme' in order to advance the country's economic construction to a higher level. As for the second question of whether the policy will change, he believes that as long as this policy is conducive to the development of the economy, the strengthening of the country's comprehensive national strength, and the improvement of the people's living standards, it can be firmly confident in this regard. \\nReport in person to General Secretary Jiang\\nNiu Guan deeply remembers the scene that took place on the morning of March 4, 2001: During the fourth session of the Ninth Session of the CPPCC National Committee, when he learned that General Secretary Jiang Zemin would personally attend discussions at the CDC and the Federation of Industry and Commerce sector group meetings, Niu Shouguang carefully prepared to form his own industry associations and peers. Difficulties encountered in the course of the meeting. At that time, the Civil Construction and Industry Federation had four members each speaking, and it was the turn of the button to speak, because the time was nearly 11, the moderator wanted to leave some time for the general secretary to speak, no longer scheduled to speak. The general secretary looked at the list and said kindly: 'My speech is not long, or ask Zhejiang's Niu Shouguang to speak. He speaks about the issue of the Association of Associations.' The general secretary named, Niu Shouguang said, he said that the association is historic, but now it is not listed as the competent department by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. This is no longer a thing to say, and now engage in the market economy. Both historically and from reality, the Federation of Commerce and Industry has formed its own associations as a job load. The body is a must. The general secretary interpolated: 'When it comes to the association of industry associations, trade chambers of commerce is indeed historic, at that time I was a factory director of a food factory in Shanghai, the Shanghai Association was very powerful, they engaged in industry self-discipline, industry unity and cooperation is very effective... The country is engaged in institutional reform, there are many things Love is in the process of development. Although we have not discussed this issue, but my personal view is that we should use their own advantages, it is necessary to form their own associations.' General Secretary Jiang also very concerned about the work of the Federation of Commerce and Industry and proposed 'three combinations': first, to actively guide the non-public economy to combine the development of their enterprises with the development of the country; second, to combine the wealth of individuals with the common interests of all the people; and the third, to follow the rules of market economy and Play socialist ethics to combine. \\nNiu Guan knows very well that these three combinations are the high expectations of the Party and the State for the Federation of Commerce and Industry, and are important guidelines for the Federation of Commerce and Industry in carrying out its work. As an assistant to the government to manage the non-public economy, the starting point and destination point for the work of the Federation is to actively guide the healthy growth of non-public economy and the healthy development of enterprises, think what they think, urgently, serve them, safeguard their legitimate rights and interests, and safeguard the specific interests of employees.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached] Niu yun: 'Painting bamboo gods also teasing\\nBamboo, is a common appreciation. In the eyes of the literary ink, it is an elegant incarnation, has a humble, tough, upright quality; and in the eyes of grassroots people, it is a symbol of auspicious, known as 'bamboo peace' and 'thrive' meaning. Remember that I lived in the mountain alley ancestral house, with a flower garden, planted a large plot of bamboo, shining, pouwei, leaving the most beautiful impression. Later, I made many painters, and some became friends. But what makes me forever memorable is the bamboo painting and feeding feelings of four old and five bamboo master painters. \\nIn the order of intersecting, the first thing that I deeply miss is Tong Xuehong. He and I met in the winter of 1952, after which he interacted continuously. During this period, he gave me a number of words, but both books and meilan sketches. Until the fall of 1956, I was a little fluttering after I served as the honor brigade captain of the provincial and Hefei National Day rally procession. Children and old in order to give me exhortation, specially sent me a bamboo, only the picture is painted upright up a few rods repair bamboo, mixed with a few bamboo shoots, lush leaves, angry. And the question of two verses: 'Not unearthed the first section, to the cloud more humble.' After receiving the painting, I said, 'Thank you for the teachings.' \\nIn 1957, I was beaten as a right-wing, allotted to the factory to supervise labor. At this time, many of my family and friends mostly cleared the line with me. Only children and old children learned, immediately sent his wife, Fang Chunhui, to visit my house and give me a painting. This painting is next to a Taihu Lake stone, surrounded by a cluster of swaying bamboo before the wind, the side question two small poems: 'Delicate stone speechless, humbly bamboo bow.' Since then, I have survived a decade of havoc, keeping these two sentences in mind. However, the children themselves were persecuted in the early days of the Cultural Revolution, jumping out of the building to commit suicide to fight with death. After the 'Cultural Revolution', Mrs. Fang Chunhui learned that my collection of words and paintings were burned in the holocaust, specially selected a bamboo with the title 'Not unearthed first, more humble to the cloud', which was given to me in memory. \\nThe second thing that I never forget is Xu Zihe. We established diplomatic relations in 1956. He is famous for the landscape of the north, so the first painting he sent me is Huangshan. In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, Xu Lao was held into the provincial museum cattle shed, because of poor food, and was not allowed to send meals at home, so Xu Lao's wife came to me for help. Exactly, the team in the provincial museum was sent out by Hefei Powder Metallurgy Factory; and the head of the project and dictatorship captain are my friends. So, for the first time I send meals, they received their warm reception, and later it was changed to Mrs. Xu directly to send it, and also received the same preferential treatment. Soon, Xu Lao Jiefang, specially painted a four-foot full of ink bamboo to give me thanks. Xu Lao painting bamboo artist French with, Zhao Menglu and become a family: Qing ya Gangjian, fun, to reach the common appreciation. \\nIn early summer of 1974, Xu Lao returned to Shanghai for medical treatment due to myocardial obstruction, until his death. Every year before the Spring Festival, he sent me a bamboo, meaning 'bamboo newspaper peace'. Sometimes, some friends go to Shanghai, I entrust them to Xu's home every time I greet me, Xu Lao gave a thank you every time. \\nThe third place that made me remember was Huang Ye Village, which we ordered in autumn 1963. At that time, I was the leader of the propaganda team at the Workers' Cultural Palace. I often asked some old Red Army to talk about the revolutionary tradition for young workers. One of them was called Guo Jingshan, and then deputy director of the provincial post and telecommunications administration, was enlightened, not 'left'. At a time, Guo Yue, I went to his house for dinner. Originally, the guest was Huang Ye Village. After meals, Huang old improvisation, gave me a bamboo. Since then, Huang old associate with me, every time Wuhu came to Hefei, he will visit my home, every time I give me to draw a variety of gestures of bamboo. Sometimes I invite him to visit his family and friends, and he always has to make a gift of painting and thank him. \\nAfter crushing the 'gang of four', Huang old reputation is long, he's a rich, humble festival, not only won the majority of city well small people love, but also by many scholars and professors praised, hailed as 'Jiangnan a bamboo', 'after Banqiao'. \\nHowever, Huang old still maintains the character of the modesty monster, not fame, disgusting itself. During this period, I have repeatedly recommended him to attend the compulsory pen meetings of factories and enterprises; as well as paintings for the Municipal Committee of the CPPCC, the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Workers' Culture Palace; he has all been invited to Bing, actively waving without a shelf, and not paid. He said: 'Calligraphy art comes from society, it should do some obligations for the nation and for the people.' \\nThe first to meet me was Zhang Jianzhong, master of painting bamboo. Because both he and I were born in 1928 and were more than ten years younger than the three predecessors, so he was presented in fourth place. \\nRemember in the winter of 1950, after dinner, I went to Zhou Junjia, editorial board of the North Anhui Daily, and went into the house and saw a Zhang Jianzhong wearing loess cloth military uniform. He was proofread at the time of the North Anhui Daily, and was sent to Zhou for trial. It is this time that we met, and then became friends of constant interaction. \\nBut I found Zhang Jianzhong a painter in the fall of 1960. At that time, I was an unpicked right-wing, feeding pigs at Feixi Farm of the City Federation of Trade Unions. I went into the city to work in a cross street to meet Zhang Jianzhong. At that time he did not shy away from me but very enthusiastically said hello to me and invited me to the nearby Hefei calligraphy house, painting two bamboo bamboo for me on the spot. At that time, his visibility was not high, but the painting was quite good, especially the calligraphy was excellent, which made me look at. Originally, he loves paintings and calligraphy since childhood, 'liberation' later to Hefei, after his work, he waved little ink hard practice, finally became a family. \\nIn 1962, I assigned to the Workers' Palace of Culture for propaganda. He works in the provincial American Association, we often cooperate, carry out staff art activities. At this time, he was already a famous painter and calligrapher. On occasion, he and the famous poet went to my house, by Yan as a poem, he with bamboo, and a painting was given to me in cooperation. After that, Xu Zihe wrote a stone for this painting, became the three cooperation boutique. Later, he returned to his hometown, Shandong Andu, became a prestigious landscape painting everyone, still contact me from time to time, and repeatedly ordered: 'If necessary, you can send paintings for free.' But I took into account his four-foot landscape, priced for hundreds of thousands of yuan, and had a bad opening, I dragged it down with the word 'good'. \\nNow, four masters have passed away, and I have entered the old year. However, the past and four old as a result of painting and bamboo and deepened feelings of all kinds of past events, interesting things, still come to mind from time to time, can not forget. \\nI didn't mind that at the end of 2011, I was invited to say good friend Pan Jia-zhong's exhibition was held at Amber Villa. I rushed to the exhibition location at the Chengyuan Villa in Amber Villa. In particular, there are many spectators in small venues, with provincial leaders, and many famous painters, critics, and organized workshops. I met Pan Jia-zhong for many years and knew that he had a bad relationship. Why was it so? I thought it was a student organization of Pan Jiachong, and the tour knew that the organizer was a young entrepreneur who loved Pan's art. The entrepreneur is invisible, because I have always enjoyed Pan's paintings and wrote an article for Pan Jiachong, 'Speak Black Cat Pan', published in various newspapers. According to the famous painter Tao Tianyue, an old friend who was invited together, the entrepreneur is named Huang Xiaozhou, is a master of painting bamboo, can be called contemporary Banqiao, painting bamboo from Zheng Banqiao, has a very personal style. \\nThen in a large painting exhibition, I found a bamboo, painted very shenrhyme, drew my attention. After questioning, the original painting came from Huang Xiaozhou, who was hailed as 'JAC Bamboo' and 'God like Banqiao'. Soon after, I got a collection of blue bamboo paintings from Huang Xiaozhou, with the inscription of the old friend Tao Tianyue, calling him contemporary Banqiao! At the same time, the old classmate Xu Youwei and his old friend Ge Junsheng and the aesthetician Guo Yin gave him very high praise. \\nBorn in xiao County, the hometown of national paintings, Huang Xiaozhou, has been deeply enlightened by the environment since childhood, the art of painting and painting. Later he learned and meritocracy, business and rich art, Canton friends, visit friends, painstaking pen ink, finally practiced into 'yellow home style', to write the blue painting bamboo famous, especially the ink bamboo prominent, by many celebrities, more loved by the majority of people. Valuable is that the boat is for people, never use paintings and paintings to fame, but actively participate in social welfare activities, for the help of hardship, study and devotion love. \\nIn recent years, I have often visited Huang Xiaozhou's Chengyuan Villa to see him painting bamboo, or attend various academic events here. Huang Xiaozhou painting, chest into bamboo, random dyeing, can dazzle, each with beauty. He knows I like bamboo and sends me a bamboo every time I meet. So I have a lot of his works and sent it to many friends through my hand. I think that in today's society, there are few painters like Huang Xiaozhou who do not seek profit and devotion! It is:\\n four old plus a little,\\n painting bamboo is known as wonderful, also\\n teasers,\\n art high. \\nDecember 27, 2013\\n (Author: Niu yun: born in Hefei in 1928, a veteran reporter of the Worker's Daily, famous folklore.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached 3] Ni genshan: 'Unforgettable Beidarland Seven Tiger Mountains One Night' (Shandong Pictorial Publishing House, 'Old Photos', Series 81)\\nI was exiled to Beidahuang in the second summer, where the 850 farm, Yunshan Livestock Farm, started distributing food rations by population. It turns out that porridge rotten rice can also be prepared to eat full, now suddenly limited, still have to do heavy work, making it very hungry. The team supervisor deceived us: 'enter the rainy season, the road is bad, the food does not come in, this is a temporary situation.' \\nFinally, after the rainy season, the rations are becoming more and more nervous, and finally compressed to seven or two gross food per person per day, synthetic food is still less than 5 or two. There is no explanation for this, and by the fall of 1960, we had been hungry for more than a year. Hard work never interrupts: whole land, sowing, hoe, seedlings, autumn harvest, desolation. Summer to take the heat of grass, fertilizer, cut strips, blanks. Winter with minus 40 degrees cold, planing frozen soil drains, into Wanda mountain logging, burning trees (Wanda Mountain is located in eastern Heilongjiang province, belonging to the Changbaishan mountain range. Nowadays 'Wandashan milk powder' is famous-the original editor's note). Hunger and tiredness make our bodies deteriorate and edema spread like a plague. Good body base, can barely support; poor body base, walking shaking. You realize that the flame of life is about to extinguish, someone on the road glimpse of the head of the cattle gnaws, will quickly pick up and send it to their mouth. One day, people pull a car when feed a small dry corn stick, each length about two or three inches, cooked in a large pot, let everyone eat. I swallowed a full meal, soon abdominal pain, eat corn sticks all spit out; another time, the team boiled a large pot 'millet pumpkin porridge' (in fact, not many rice and pumpkin), let everyone drink, I drank a few large bowls, gastrointestinal swelling, *** shy big water bag, hard to move, had Lying on the hillside, wait for the rice soup to move down. \\nAt that time, we were willing to be arranged to pick water for the group, and the cooks could enjoy some rice pots or tofu tofu. Personal foreign aid was basically cut off, a partner came to a box of pastries at the home, and received only six small wooden planks and one parcel of leather when they were collected at the post office. Post office officials said the contents of the box were eaten by 'rats' halfway. \\nOur group of exiled intellectuals is weakened and spiritually collapsed by starving lives, heavy labor, indifference, discrimination and threats against farm leaders. Tong Aicheng, the principal of a machine department (the first machinery industry), child school, hanged himself, and Cao Zuoren, Ministry of Light Industry, died, and so on. Farm leaders have no hidden heart for us, forced daily pressure: often rumors that people are tortured to death in starvation and fatigue, such as Zhang Jianmiao of the Overseas Chinese Committee, Tu Shuang of the Ministry of Transport, Yang Taiquan, and so on. To solve the tummy problem, we have brains: digging wild vegetables, eating wild plants, stealing raw wheat, corn, soybeans. With these 'opportunities', it will only keep people on the brink of death, and will not save the doom. \\nOctober 13, 1960, an ominous day. We were instructed to go to the four teams of Xiaoyunshan Seven Tiger Mountains to rush the rain to collect Far away, we get up at 3 a.m., eat two big black eggs each, and send two black shoots for lunch. In a hurry, we fumbled in a dark piece of departure. \\nIn October, the autumn cold has been thick. There was more rain that year, some autumn and flooding, the road was mostly muddy pond, stepped down to the deep mud and calf, shoes tend to fall into the mud, it is difficult to pull out. Everyone went exhausted, only after another to reach the bean field. The day is not light yet, we sit on the ground on standby, and the cold wind blows quiver. \\nOpen sickle, the gloomy sky drifted down the ground with light rain. Clothes soaked, numbness of fingers, thorough heart bones. Tian Wei is long, not at a glance. Our hearts sink in step. \\nI don't know how long, the team site came to order that he could have lunch, take a break after the meal, and then continue to work. \\nTwo black shoots per person, a few mouths were eaten. Everywhere muddy, water and wet grass, everyone can only stand and rest, when the rain is dense. The sky gradually dimmed down, the gloomy sky still floated with sporadic rain, Tian Lu is expected to come to the end, the team site ordered to close work. Everyone gathered together and ready to withdraw from the bean field. Tanabe has a reservoir, about 20 meters wide, and we had to wade under the pond. Water depth without knee, some places can be with the waist. A few physically unsupported, supported by companions, struggled to the roadside. \\nMost people went on the road, and a few were still traveling to the water. Twilight, the instructor and team site several people mention the march for the lead, we embark on the return journey. Behind the people fall farther, the end gradually can not take care of. \\nThe people behind were anxious, and someone cried in desolation: 'Wait for us in front!' 'Carry out the revolutionary humanism, don't throw us away!' 'Save us...' The voice is getting farther and faint. The voice of Hou Delin, the ancient book publishing house, seems particularly bleak. Teachers and others stopped, held the march and criticized loudly: 'Hurry up, do not rub!' After that, and continue to rush forward, echo several times before and after, finally, all the sound disappeared in the sinking night. An inexplicable sense of terror that struck my heart. \\nI realized that the environment here was strange, dark at night, and if left behind in the wilderness, it would get lost, in distress, and even life in danger. \\nThen I suddenly saw a black shadow sitting on the roadside. Come closer, it is the National Economic Commission's horse mirror bright. He came with me to Beidahuang. I asked him, 'Ma, what happened? Can you go? Do you want me to help you?' 'All right, I take a break. You go first!' Ma, who has participated in the conversion soldiers who have participated in the fight against the US aid to the North Korean, has raised the opinion of the 'chickens not to lay eggs' during the whole wind movement, and was beaten as a 'right-wing.' I did not expect that his life fire was exhausted and he could never go back to the team site again. \\nIt was later learned that two of those who had fallen behind fell near the reservoir, and several had been unable to speak out, with partners, barely supporting the way back. In the roadside woods, buddies find weeds and branches, point the campfire, let the seriously ill number sit down on the tree. In the beating light of the fire, the patient's wet clothes rise up strands of hot air, thin pale face makes people worried. At this time, the partner who returned to the team site sent hot soup and, but the patient has not opened his mouth, can only watch his mouth coveted food... When the patient was brought back to the team site, there was a weak nose, the four team health staff came to rescue, only looked, he said indifferently: 'No save!' The voice has just fallen, and the man has gone long. Call for help at the session department by phone, and the answer was: 'Say it tomorrow!' \\nThis night, including Kong Xianzhong, a faculty member of the Ministry of Commerce who fell near the reservoir and Yang Jun of the design bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry, a total of seven people. In addition to Ma Jingliang of the National Economic Commission, there is also a machine department returning home overseas Chinese, amateur writer Liu Huchen, as well as Tang Yihua, lecturer of the PLA School of Surveying and Mapping, Chen Bolong, and teacher Xu Zhengming. After Liu Huchen came to the beida desertion, he insisted on writing a diary every night, accumulated a lot of material, and had not finished it into books, and people had already sparked their hands. His lover has also been expelled from Beijing and laid down in Baicheng Zi, Jilin. Poor mountain backbone, it is a wife dream man! The article did not die first, often make relatives and friends tears! \\nOver the past three years, there have been death, illness, suicide and disappearances on farms, and people have become commonplace. But seven people suddenly died overnight, for the first time. Although the farm is diluted and understated, in our hearts, it still stirs a strong shock, and our lives have been as low as mustard and mustard. Are the seven people who should not have died prematurely, but suddenly died, are not showing us the fate of the surviving ones tomorrow? Faced with the upcoming third harsh winter of Beidahuang, really shudder... [Shandong Pictorial Publishing House published the 'Old Photo' series 81]\\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Appendix IV】Ni genshan: 'Why China's Democratic Road Is Difficult and Long' (June 18, 2012)\\n\\tWhile competing for the world with the KMT, the Mao group made many solemn commitments to the implementation of democracy, vowed to make clear and publicized the press. He was a 'cave pair' with a democrat Huang Yan Pei. Published 'On Coalition Government'. And so on. Pending the overthrow of the national government, the regime becomes easy, and Mao became the throne, initially remained among the leaders of the country, giving democratic personalities a few seats to put their way. But after a short time of joy, the Chinese Communist Party came into full power and became the all-in-one party world. Those democrats who had worked hard for the CCP were broken across the river or had their place, or had no right to work, or stood on the side, and even cry around the corner. Worse still, the promise of democracy was discarded, and a 180-degree shift was made, and the original promises were turned into a lie of deceit. Start to implement one-party dictatorship and totalitarian authoritarian \\n\\tIn the first 30 years of the Mao's group in power, with class struggles as the platform, political movements continued to turn the country into a purgatory, and the economy was on the verge of collapse twice, with more than 70 million people killed abnormally. Deprived of the assets of land, rich and capitalists, making them dictatorships, poor people. After more than 30 years, under the one-party dictatorship system, the market economy was introduced, and only economic reforms were carried out, politics remained intact, or even regressed, and developed into the capitalism of power and power. Gaogan executives and their relatives, politics and commerce all eat, trade rights money, sell officials and rush up rich, and immediately become powerful bourgeoisies; according to a survey in April 2010, including by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and other officials at the level of the regiment level and their families, account for 80% of the wealth of the people. This group of people has become billionaires economically and enjoys all kinds of privileges in politics; squeezing people's cream and monopolizing the prosperity and prosperity. \\nOn the other hand, people who are powerless, without money and without property (real estate), are forced into poverty slaves under the weight of three mountains of housing, health care and education. Social polarization and distribution is grossly unfair. Officials are not democratically elected and have nothing to do with the interests of the people. Social contradictions accumulate deep, group events up to 1.2 million years, and the water is hot, popular grievances boiling, perilous and dangerous. \\n\\tIt is well known that before 1949, ordinary people were able to speak in the press and make democratic claims, and to enjoy freedom of assembly and association, strike strike, demonstration, etc. However, after 1949, for more than 60 years, ordinary people have been held in cages by the government, only to be honest, not to speak of chaos and become instruments of tame (nickname of slaves). Poor ordinary people have never taken ownership of their ownership, I don't know what democracy is. There is a slight disagreement or disagreement with the authorities, blacklisted, monitored, disappeared, suppressed or even warned to buried alive. The relentless reality shows that democracy is getting further away from us and that the prospects are gloomy. \\n\\tHow to strive for democracy is the current dilemma. If any country is to move away from feudal or dictatorship, totalitarian dictatorship, and to achieve democratic constitutional rule, it must interact with the horizons; combine up and down and work together to advance together. Citizenship and democratic aspirations are the basic driving forces. People in power have a sense of human rights and their ability to adapt to historical trends and to abandon old images are key factors. Together, the two sides can strive to complete the democratic transformation of the country at the lowest cost and at the lowest cost. \\n\\tTake a look back at the reality of mainland China. There are enormous obstacles and serious obstacles and difficulties in advancing the democratic process and achieving the democratic transformation of the country, both in the opposition and the citizens. \\n\\tFirst of all, from the DPRK aspect of key factors: the current ruler is the party world, the reform and opening up of vested interests, privileged classes, and powerful bourgeoisies. They (including relatives), own a lot of wealth, kidnapping and manipulating the party and the government. Although there is a division of gangs, what groups, the Shanghai gang, the princess party, etc., the overall goal is to adhere to one-party dictatorship, capture power and save money and protect vested interests; it will never allow spillover and power-sharing. They disregard the livelihood of the people, disregard the suffering of the people, use their power to squander the polls, 'three public consumption', 'image projects', 'image projects', celebrations scenes, stabilize, give money 'to foreign aid' (non-Yala), and so on. Throughout the DPRK, the vast majority are despicable politicians who have no faith and have no political ideas, and are interested in seizing power for money, selfish interests, and rats; there is no politician who respects human rights, worries the people, and takes the world as their duty. They reject political reform and fear democracy in order to safeguard vested interests; they fear losing power and access to money, and even more fear of being liquidated. If you want this man to push forward political reform, open up the party ban and implement constitutional democracy, it would be tantamount to working with tiger. What is more serious is the closed, rigid, stubborn and conservative gangs of Gaogan executives that have traditionally excluded political elites who are active in ideology and can innovate and reform, and choose talents to be used to reverse the elimination. Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang and other outstanding talents, were deposed, became a heroic character. Wen Jiabao understands universal values. Although many times calls for democracy, breaking the water of politics, he is in a precarious situation. Where can I see a dawn of constitutional democracy in the face of the DPRK's stubborn, conservative, rigid, and 'five' vested interests group! \\n\\tThe former Soviet Union was indeed a political, economic and military monster, but the leadership group was only the privileged class, and the powerful bourgeoisies did not appear, can the emergence of selfless and fearless statesmen like Khrushchev, Gorbachev, Yeltsin, and dare to be the first to the world; thus allowing Russia to emerge out of the Soviet period dilemma, Democratic Progressive Avenue. Taiwan has emerged, Jiang Jingguo, an eminent statesman, who is worried about the country and the people, recognized that there is no permanent ruling party in the world, and has resolutely opened the party ban on the ban, so that Taiwan has successfully moved towards constitutional democracy. Mr. Jiang's famous history, work in Qianqiu, Liufang hundred, Wan Dai Jingyang. The politics of mainland China is almost an irresistible saline plate, where can the outstanding politicians emerge above! Sadness! \\n\\tSecond, dissect the people who are the basic drivers of democracy. After all kinds of brutal rule, cast the homeless character tamed by the Chinese people. As long as there is a mouth to eat, it will be submissible in reverse, have to pass through, and steal life. Lu Xun once divided the Chinese people into slaves who are seated and unstable. After 1949, the authorities have laid a vast network of land in the territory for the protection regime and strengthened their rule. Through family registration, files, introduction letters, various ticket relations and organizational formalities, the Chinese people become slaves of personal attachment. Individuals leave the 'organization', standing cone without land, survival no door, inch walking difficult. People in order to eat bowl, live, can only be honest, do not dare to talk about chaos; look at the leadership color act. The CCP organizations at all levels have 48,000 provincial, municipal, county and township party committees, and more than 3.7 million branches and branches at the grass-roots level. There are 'little feet detective team', eyeliner in the street, all-weather master movement and quiet, monitor the Chinese people. In addition, the masses are also instigated and encouraged to inform, expose and report, in the name of delineating the boundaries, allowing people to 'perish their relatives', sellers seek for honor, and fall out of stone. Plus piece of police, guoan, plainclothes, card, patrol, the territory guardian as a barrel. Once there is a wind and grass movement, or a group incident occurs, the above-mentioned people of all kinds of colors are immediately 'screened', through a sieve, or account after the fall, to find out the 'head of the head', shoot the head bird and kill the chicken and monkey. One person is cut, family members and friends will be affected by the company; once it becomes 'untouchable', it is difficult to turn over and get out of his head for life. In the midst of the Chinese people, everyone is at risk; deeply feel blame, but to prostrate in the ground, be chilling, subservient, obediently. Even after three years of famine, farmers would rather endure starvation and did not dare to grab food; they are afraid to go out to appeal, cite their relatives, and escape for food; they can only sit at home and wait for death. This is unique in the world. \\n\\tAfter reform and opening up, the environment has been loosened. But in the Party world, the living space of the Chinese people is still squeezed and restricted. If there is a slight disagreement or disagreement over politics, they will be monitored and disappeared. Festival or sensitive period (such as 'two sessions', 6.4), police, special, plainclothes, all over the streets, as if the trees were soldiers. In order to preserve power, the authorities do not hesitate to devote a large amount of human, material and financial resources to 'maintain stability'. In 2012, the State maintained a stable fiscal budget of 71.8 billion yuan, while the national defense budget was 6700.3 billion yuan, and the maintenance expenditure has surpassed the defense expenditure for three consecutive years. As in Linyi, Shandong, Chen Guangcheng, a lawyer for the blind, does not hesitate to invest 60 million a year; appalling. \\n\\tOn the other hand, the CCP has made significant results in promoting brainwashing. Let the Chinese people forget the past, do not know the true history; blockade information, Annunciation does not report worries, so that the people cannot know. Only the information of the Central Communications Department can be followed. Using the media to incorporate a kind of thought, uniform public opinion, and thoroughly implement the policy of foolishness. This aspect has been very successful. Except for a few people to grasp the truth through the Internet, or have the ability to think about them, most of the Chinese, especially the young and middle-aged, muddled, ignorant understand, do not know what is happening today, can only be blindly followed by the wind and at the mercy of others. It is difficult to emerge such leaders as Chen Sheng and Wu Guang in the lives of Yunyun who are so accustomed to slavery, and develop into the basic driving force for democracy. This cannot but be said to be the sadness of the nation. \\n\\tIn particular, in 1989, Deng Xiaoping dared to take a big deal in the world, and blatantly mobilized the field army's tanks, machine guns and artillery, and sent troops to suppress unarmed innocent students and people, bloodwashing Tiananmen Square, causing serious casualties. In the world, a wave of discerning. Solitary thieves use violence to destroy the newly unearthed bud of democracy. Neither the North Ocean warlords nor the Kuomintang dare to do, Deng Xiaoping, dare to slaughter, dare to slaughter, nailed to the shame of history and destined to This serious incident, which has not been rehabilitated for 23 years, has greatly damaged the national ethnicism, and the scars continue to drop blood to date. The democratic process has been severely depressed, delayed and even blocked. It has far-reaching implications for the democratic aspirations of the Chinese people. \\n\\tIn 2011, an unemployed Tunisian youth burned himself in the streets, igniting a Jasmine revolution. The blazing fire quickly formed in North Africa and the Middle East. In recent years, many violent self-immolation incidents in mainland China, as well as mass incidents of millions of people, have been isolated and failed to form a fire. In addition to the above difficulties in forming the basic dynamics of democracy, there is also an important reason for the fact that the authorities shredded civil cutting, paralyzing the social veins, making it difficult to echo each other; banning all NGOs, there are no real trade unions or agricultural associations; and blocking information and blindling the population in the drum. So easily each break, quietly extinguish. Civil democratic demands and justice activities have been stifled in the bud. It makes it difficult for democracy movements to develop a climate. \\n\\tLooking at all times, China and abroad, the mainland authorities have strict adherence to the regime, their deep rule over the people, and the occupation of private interests and privileges are all unique. Although the governors of the Gungon in power are absent and diplomacy is weak, it is indeed experts in the hands of experts, far ahead of the big and small public servants of any country in terms of putting people into power, grabbing power, collecting money, playing with children and daughters. In such a desert-saline territory of a party dictatorship and totalitarian dictatorship, democracy and freedom are extremely difficult to take root, grow and bloom flowers; look at it, and look at it, infinitely dark. Woe! \\n\\tWhere is the way out? The Mao group violently overthrew the national government and imposed Marxism-Leninism on the people. For more than 60 years, class struggles and totalitarian authoritarianism, too many enemies, grievances with the people and heavy blood debts; the Chinese people have suffered great suffering, and it is difficult to escape. Therefore, Mao's use of a gun to build national governance, tyranny is cool to tiger wolf; it is not a historical choice, let alone the choice of the people. To be sure, who wants to live in such a political environment!? Can't afford to hide. Whosoever has a door and a way, flee one after another, choose another high. It is unavoidable that Mao's abusive powers, lawlessness and lawlessness, commit serious crimes against the nation's nation that cannot be forgiven. For more than sixty years, Mao has been regarded as a totem on the mainland. To date, the failure of officials to disclose and approve, the people do not complain, continue to carry a heavy burden of history. It is uninverted and indiscriminate, and constitutes an insurmountable obstacle to the democratic process. A famous writer from Vihee said: 'A people who do not know how to reflect on their fault, is a nation that has no hope.' We must think twice. At present, the power gangs, together with the powerful and rich, in order to preserve vested interests and all kinds of privileges, grasping power, will never loose their hands. Adopting the usual deception and deterrence, using political brainwashing and foolish policies, make the Chinese people numb and dementia, neither vitality nor independent innovation spirit. To abandon social ethics and morality, exclude modern and progressive civilization, rely on fascism and police agents to govern the country. This makes the nation far behind the trend of the modern world, and the image of the country is stigmatized and stigmatized by the world. In a word, those in power are the private and vested interests of one party, and they do not hesitate to destroy the entire country and nation! What a sinner! It has blocked the door of all political reform, making constitutional democracy a mirrored month, talking on paper, and far away. Where is the way out!? \\n\\tSadly horrible prospect. We are in a polarized and polarized society of powerful capitalism, watching: high-ranking officials and powerful rich rich people, emigrate their relatives and children to Western developed countries to enjoy luxury living; huge assets are transferred abroad, property investment, and fertilizer drain out of land, arranged to escape. According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and other surveys, from 1996 to 2003, the mainland escaped capital, flowing into accounts of senior officials and their relatives abroad amounted to 2.2 trillion yuan. According to the 'Trends', 187 members of the 17th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, 142 alternate members and 113 members of the Disciplinary Commission have immediate family members residing, living, working, or acquiring nationality in Western countries. According to US government statistics, Chinese Communist Party officials or above (including retired), children with American green cards or citizenship account for 74.5%; grandchildren reach more than 91%, all Americans. In other words, mainland China is an American elder who is in power. Nowadays, most senior officials are naked, always ready to grease the feet, and slippery. So dry, verbal anti-US, ostensible stronger with the United States; there is another clear choice in the heart, and vote with feet. Deserve to be double-sided hypocrite. It is this group of people, giant greedy rats, gradually emptied the country and squeezed out the country, dried up the natural environment, destroyed rare arable farmlands, depleted mineral resources, poisoned food and drinking water, making the country a rotten, hollow, decayed old tree, and will collapse. Then they slapped their ass and left behind a devastated mess, abandoning a whole bunch of impoverished and impoverished civilians, facing a sad horrible prospect. The Rand Company of the United States has long predicted that in 20 years, China will be the poorest country in the world. The issue was also pointed out recently by US Secretary of State Hillary in a speech at Harvard University. This is by no means alarmist. It seems that, as the proverb says, the CCP does not fight corruption is the country, and the Party is deceased against corruption. History leaves us time to think, and the opportunity to choose, is running out. When this grim situation, how to prevent it? The way to root is to follow the trend of democracy in the world, tighten political reforms, open up the party ban, realize constitutional democracy, also govern the people, and return to the country, making China truly a modern democracy. Only in this way can the Party be saved and the country saved. It can also enable the party to be elected by populace, gain legal power in power, and enable the country to become a full-fledged and truly rising power in political, economic and cultural terms, and gloriously integrated into the forest of democracy and progress in the world. If so, the sad horrors may not arise, and there is still great hope for nations and nations. \\n\\tConcluding remarks. Personally, since my youth, I yearned to pursue the political ideas of democracy, freedom, equality and fraternity. I have looked forward to Yan'an; and fought for it. Now that 88 years old, while the ideal of democracy is still distant, why is the road to democracy difficult and long! Fervently hopes to see democratic flowers bloom in the Chinese land in their lifetime. Special reference to the revolutionary pioneer Plekhanov 'The Last Idea' numerical words as the end, with the people of the people, Riezheheda: 'A country, as long as its citizens are still poor, will not become a great country! Citizens are wealthy, the country is rich! What determines a country truly great is not its vast territory or even its long history, but its democratic tradition, the standard of living of its citizens.' (June 18, 2012, the pen)\\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached 5】Ni genshan: 'Tour Shenyang Dashuai House' (July 13, 2012)\\nI had the privilege of revisiting Shenyang in my year. In 1933, I said goodbye to the ravine of my hometown to Tianjin, passing through Fengtian (now Shenyang), and embarked on this strange, novelty city for the first time. Nowadays the past 80 years, the old land revisited, the vicissitudes of great change, emotions. This time, in addition to re-visiting Fengtian Forbidden City, Qing Dynasty Taiji Zhaotombs and other monuments and 'strange slopes', also visited the late, famous Dashuai House; is also the main harvest of this trip. \\nDashuai House is located in Chaoyang Street, Shenhe District, is known as the Northeast King Zhang Zuolin, and the former residence of army admiral Zhang Xueliang's father and son. Also known as Shaoshai House. Founded in 1914 (3 years of the Republic), and completed in 1933. Covers an area of over 36,000 square meters and a construction area of more than 27,000 square meters. The entire mansion has three buildings in East and West, others are outside the compound; covering Yimen Gate, Living Room, Study, Xiao Qing Building, Daqing Building, Garden, Miss Zhao Si Building, Guan Di Temple, Frontier Bank and other buildings. \\nIn the courtyard door on the shadow wall, carved 'Hongxi' words; the door side of the drum stone lion and upper Ma stone. Entrance to a total of three courtyard, all green brick mixed structure. Block north facing south, 'mesh' glyph. Gatehouse carved flower, inkstone relief under the window wall, very exquisite. One entrance to the hospital rooms, where logistics services are located. The Binary Hospital is a venue for official events. East courtyard consists of large, small green lou and Shuaifu Garden. Daqing building north of the East courtyard, three blue brick mix, one floor is a handsome military aircraft government, as well as reception of friends. Second floor for handsome living office. The three floors are not open. A northeastern corner is 'Tiger Hall', because the east side road town manvoy Tang Yulin, sent two tiger physical specimens, displayed here and named. Yang Yuting, Chang Yin Huai was executed by the little handsome. Xiaoqing House is an early Chinese ancient building. In 1928, the handsome from Beijing returned to Shen, was injured by Japan in Huang Gutun, and finally died downstairs. There are six buildings in the West Court, and young handsome is ready for children to live. 9.18 Not completed before, then built by Japanese. \\nOutside the East Wall, there is a geometric monomer building building, is the residence of Ms. Zhao Si. Because of its name and handsome wife room, can not enter the handsome house, bias in this. Little handsome lady generously, with private money to pay for the building and decoration of the building. \\nIn addition, the nearby Shuaifu private border bank, is a three-storey building designed by the Germans. It looks like a pistol from the air and the barrel part is a facade. Now read 'Museum of Finance'. Not allowed to visit. \\nHandsome reverence Guan Gong, in the northeast corner of Shuaifu built about the Temple. It is understood that Dashuai also built two Guan Di Temple outside the wind and rain altar in Shenyang and the Great South Gate. Although the handsome green forest was born, but proud, revered Guan Gong. When he took control of the Northeast, he never bowed his head to the Japanese and cooperated. The Japanese had no way to take him, and finally blew up his collegiate murder. When the big handsome issued borderline bank notes, vowed not to harm the common people, each printed 'day good' word, from the beginning to the end to ensure that it will be honored, unwavering. It was said that at the time of the construction of the Frontier Bank, one household refused to move; in order to avoid the household, the building design was changed to a pistol type. Great handsome can respect private property and do not use power to forcibly demolish. Only this matter is that today's words 'wholeheartedly serve the people' and violently demolish residents. The showroom has handsome handsome hands-book 'natural heart' ink treasure, embodying the dignity of the reasonable people's character, earnest awe-revealing. \\nThere are many inscriptions and pictures of senior officials who come to visit here in the Shuaifu showroom. The vast majority of them are praise for the less handsome. Little handsome old Gero Zhengcao General wrote: 'A lifetime of devotion, work for a long time.' 'Thousands of ancient heroes, national heroes.' This leads me to think-\\nAt 9.18 hours, in the past, Jiang Gong called 'not resist' oracles. The little handsome has been clarified in his old age. It was his own misassessment of the situation and wanted to make small and small things; ordered not to repay a word or fight against Japan. I did not expect Japan to move this time and lost the three provinces in the East, leaving 40 million compatriots into slaves of the country. At that time, Jiang Gong had warned the little handsome in Shijiazhuang's army that if the country fell into the hands of GCD, it would be abused. Less handsome failed to understand. In 1936, actually launched Xian Bing Jian. Since then, Chinese history has been rewritten. History has a lot of controversy about this. What are the consequences of this move of less handsome for the nation, pushing the country's progress or regression? What causes the nation to lose? Owner or servant? Euphoria, happiness or fear of suffering? \\nAfter reflection, from the nation's point of view, the little handsome is an ancient hero or a thousand sinners, caresses the past, it goes without saying. It may be assumed that, in the absence of the incident in Xi'an, the mainland will, like Taiwan today, and a complete and unified China would have become a democratic developed country; the living situation of the children of Yanhuang will be another new look. Ms. Chen Xiangmei in 1992 in this poem: 'Xian Bingma a chess, also the wind is also sadly.' Quite intriguing. General Zhang Xuesi, the young handsome brother, was also alive and dead in the 'Cultural Revolution', adding to his national hatred. Less handsome travel to the United States in the old age, the mainland frequently invited to return, less handsome always failed to return to the native It is estimated that he feels deeply guilty about his homeland. Goodbye to China's father and folks. Therefore, 'lifetime dedication', or should be replaced by 'life of iniquity'. Little handsome and original lady Yu Fengzhi, have three children and a daughter, female name Lu Ying; eldest zi Lu Xun, died in the United States in a car accident; second son Lu, was scared crazy by the cannon, into a plant man; young child Lu Qi, died of childhood. Three children lose, or think that they are revenuable? Shao handsome original famous 'dandy', drug good, bad behavior; after repeated mistakes; life of what devotion? \\nShao handsome buckle Jiang Bingjian in Xi'an, causing Jiang Gong to be humiliated and sweeping; Jiang Gong can tolerate less handsome not kill, lifelong good care. Founding father Peng Dehuai only had political differences with Mao's, and Mao could not see it. He actually had a ruthless hand against Peng and died cruelly. In this case alone, it is enough to judge how the differences between Jiang Gong and Mao's personality are high! \\nIn the square in front of the handsome house, there is a little handsome tall arong outfit statue, based on the pedestal, majestic and distant. Many people are here to take pictures to commemorate. I bare, avoid leaving. [July 13, 2012, as amended]\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 10"}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】Du Fujian/Hui Yixian: Ni hengdian: Tongbai Mountain 'Living Dictionary' (2005.7.7)\\nRecently, with the advanced education activities of Communist Party members, the deeds of Ni hengdian, old party member Ni hengdian in Henan Tongbai Mountain District, are being widely disseminated. \\nIn the 20,000 square kilometers of Tongbai Mountain District of Henan Province, people struggle to recite the legendary story of an old man: after his leave, disregarding the elderly and weak, trekking the source of the Huaihe River with tenacious perseverance, trail throughout the 18 counties under Tongbai Mountain, a trip 30,000 kilometers, wrote 600,000 words of Tongbai 'Baishanzhi', and in 'Zhongzhou Ancient and Modern', 'Henan Journal of Seniors' and other publications Published more than 30 academic papers, made outstanding contributions to Henan Xinyang, Queshan and Tongbai three counties, and was called the 'living dictionary' of Tongbai Mountain. This old man is Ni hengdian, who left the office of Shi Zhi, Tongbai County, Henan Province. \\n'Modo's rest on the rest, dedication to write the spring and autumn; the first fear of the journey bitter, leave history history.' This is a sentiment poem written by the elderly Ni hengdian, and is also a true portrayal of his old life. \\nBorn in 1930, Ni hengdian was born in a remote small village in Tongbai Mountain District, Henan Province. In January 1949, he took part in the revolution, and was neutral in Tongbai Mountain anti-hegemony struggle. In 1957 he was misclassified as the right, permanently decentralizing labor. In 1979, he has been working in Tongbai County Shi Zhi Office, participated in the revision of local literature such as 'Tongbai County Chi' and 'Tongbai Party History'. Although he is getting older, he never obeys old, like a young man before leaving leave, often alone, carrying a bag, carrying a kettle, carrying dry food, looking in the mountains. \\nThere is one thing that has made Ni hengdian unable to release. At that time, the State Council and the National Local Chi Office and other leading bodies, respectively, called on Tongbai County to complete the compilation of the 'Tongbai Mountain Chi' as soon as possible, but because the Tongbai Mountains affected five regions, 18 counties and cities of the two provinces, were constrained by a number of factors such as funding problems, personnel problems, organizational problems and other factors. Nor did this be done on the day of rest. It's an unfinished wish for him. After his leave, he was determined to overcome all the difficulties and had to fill that gap with his heart's desire. \\nIn 1996, Ni hengdian, who has worked for six years, left for six years. As an old cadre who worked before liberation, he could enjoy his old age, but he did not, because that desire was calling him. In April of this year, despite repeated discouragement from his family, he drew up the study and writing articles. He bought maps, compasses, cameras and other equipment, and began to explore Tongbai Hill alone. Repair is a rigorous work, can not hearsay, can not hope Wensheng righteousness. So he looked for the relevant information while looking for Xianda celebrities, trek the mountain and water field examination. He is often alone in the mountains for more than a dozen days; taking photos, drawings, interviews, hungry gnawing dry food, thirsty drinking spring, sleepy wilderness mountains. He wrote in his diary: 'The dragon is still rain, and the old cow knows nothing; the old cow knows the sunset is short, do not have to whip himself.' \\nThree counties of Tongbai, Queshan and Xinyang counties are stagnant, river crossings, for a long time, border disputes persist, and villagers in the three areas often flaunt, fights and pleadings, which directly affect social stability. Ni hengdian turned over the mountains, a field visit, extensively verified, and finally identified the junction mountain of Tong, letter and Quesan counties. With this mountain and three river ditches as the dividing line, the borders of the three counties were completely delineated, and received the support of all parties. Ni hengdian reported the revision of the results to the State Council. In 2000, the relevant departments of the State Council, on the basis of his investigation, officially erected a pillar at the junction of Tongbai, Queshan and Xinyang three counties, and named the junction mountain as 77 peaks (due to 770 meters above sea level). Since then, the three conflicts have finally been resolved. \\nIn this way, during the four years after his departure, Ni hengdian trapped the Tongbai, Tanghe, Zaoyang, Suizhou, Xinyang, Queshan, Biyang and other ten counties and cities, including more than 400 mountains and 200 rivers, including the Tongbai Mountains, and more than 200 rivers in the Tongbai Mountains. Millions of words of survey notes, and published 'Huaiyuan Carol', 'Jin Huaiyuan', 'Tongbai Mountain Range Rover' and other books. \\nMorning out mountaineering expedition, twilight pick lamp writing. It lasted 6 and a half years, 'Tongbaishan Chi' finally available. The whole book 600,000 words, 16 volumes, genre based, narrative, history, biography, video combination, supplemented by charts, photos, systematically and factually documented the geomorphology of Tongbai Mountain, mountains and rivers, Buddha culture, species deposits, customs figures, major events and other aspects of the history and current situation. Relevant expert evaluation: This is a large material book that objectively reflects the full picture of Tongbai Mountain. It is of great relevance and far-reaching historical significance for understanding Tongbaishan, protecting the Huaihe source, developing Tongbai, revitalizing the economy of old areas, as well as patriotism education and revolutionary traditional education. \\n'Do books seek for name and profit, and the pen always want to benefit the future.' This is a pair of couplings written by the elderly Ni hengdian. The family economy is difficult because of the meager wage alone, coupled with the writing of self-funded visits. The most valuable thing in his family was the 14-inch black-and-white TV that had watched for years, and written in a child's homework book. It was not until 2003 that the county's main leader learned about him, and sent him a free telephone call and sent a color TV. Someone asked him, you for so many years to write 'Tongbaishan Chi' self-purchase equipment, self-digging, self-inflicted hardship, find guilt, figure what? The old man calmly said, 'What do I think? As a national cadre, although I withdrew, I still enjoyed the salaries given by the Party and the people, and I could not eat it in vain. Be able to play the heat in the life of life, do some worthy of the society, worthy of their own, good for the people, leave something for future people, this life without regret.' \\nWalk through Aoyama. After the completion of Tongbaishan Chi, Ni hengdian, 76, set a new goal: to complete two works, 'Tongbai Mountain Buddhism' and 'Huaihezhi'. He said, if this task is not completed, I will give it to the next generation, and also to a 'fool'! This is the pursuit of a Communist Party member! \\n(Hyperlink 'http://www.farmer.com.cn/wlb/nmrb' Peasant Daily 2005.7.7)"}

He made a series of reactionary remarks, carried out a lot of illegal activities, revealing that he was a full right-wing element. \\nFrom the beginning of the wind, he listened to the wind everywhere and went to the Shandong People's Publishing House and the Labor Bureau to find some elements who were dissatisfied with the party to study the strategy of attacking the party. In addition to his own fabrication of materials and exaggerating the facts, he also actively incited others to attack the party. He grabbed Li Xiuwu (the family is a rich farmer, who has been struggled), with dissatisfaction and passionate about Lin Su-qing to look at the problem, and he incites them to say, 'Or young people preside over justice and stick to the truth.' He found that Xie Jincheng had dissatisfaction because he had not been promoted, he said, 'Old Thank you is in a difficult situation.' He saw the head of the Kim Bento pay section (also because he was not promoted with dissatisfaction), writing a big print to support his statement, and he hurried to 'talk' to him and consolidate his 'feelings.' He supposedly supported him too few, and he said with emotion, 'If the office has me (two), Ni huanghe Huang River, things will get up.' \\nIn the middle of the wind, he advocated focusing fire on the issue of the lives of leading cadres. He knows that in this regard it can most provoke the grievances of some people with individualism and absolute egalitarian sentiment, and is also best able to 'bearish leadership' and carry out personal attacks. In order to provoke the grievances of his comrades with the leadership, he fabricated the material and stigmatized leading cadres. He said, 'Provincial Committee × comrades are slow, accept fresh things slowly, learn not well.' He also said, 'The people who lead literary and artistic work do not have real talents, they are lay leaders.' He also said that the leadership of housing should be good, and life must become nobility. He said, 'The leading cadres of the Public Security Department have no merit, profit first and suffer, do not read very much, rely on the Party to eat,' he said. 'I do editorial work at the Public Security Office, and call you leadership as a form, not only in our lay men. Inside is the insider, that is to stand up in the pedestrian is also high.' When the leadership conducted counter-criticism, he said: 'The director and director are very lacking self-criticism and no consciousness is high,' and said: 'In the whole wind, people just touched your sores, you jumped like thunder. When counterproductive, you dig good meat on the healthy skin of the people, how can people resist?' \\nHe was extremely dissatisfied with our cadre policy with both merit and talent, and in order to realize his personal ambitions and provoke the relationship between party and non-party cadres, he made a vicious distortion of our cadre policy. He fabricated the Public Security Department to promote cadres with four principles: ① first party members after the masses, ② first the political ministry after others, ③ first-come, ④ can say talk, close to the leadership. 'Time has brought an upgrade to the party members,' he said. 'Party members can improve for a few years.' And he said: 'The cadres of the Public Security Department are of low quality, many are not competent, but they are party members, so that they can see them with me.' \\nHe hated the Communist Party members. He said that communist members had a loss of reason and said that communist members violated human rights and violated the Constitution. \\nHe is hostile to the people's public security organs, and he said, 'The Public Security Department is a bunker, killing steaming and intimidating.' 'Public security organs are used to deal with their own comrades with their enemies.' Wang Gan, chief of the Provincial Department of Correctional Services, is sick and dead. He slandered by plane, saying, 'There are many ways to kill people by the public security organs. There is no way to save people.' He said, 'The anti-counter movement is the good meat of people, I have suffered a blow and traumatized in the anti-reaction movement.' He said, 'The Public Security Department is dedicated to counteracting, and it should have fewer problems, but there have also been a lot of bias. The anti-bias is not unique to the Public Security Department. Other departments also have a general nature to counter errors.' \\nHe believes that the electoral system in my country is undemocratic and formalistic. He said, 'Some people become representatives of the people after being exemplary, which is actually designated by the central government.' But he praised Western democracy, saying, 'America is very high in science, and workers earn more.' \\nHe strongly supported and praised Wen Wei Bao's offensive against the party, saying, 'The Wen Wei Wei Bao' was highly thoughtful and high level, said people's heart,' after the People's Daily criticized the bourgeois direction of Wen Wei Bao for the first time, he also fought unevenly for the Interchange Report. 'Wen Wei Bao is no problem'. However, it was very disgusted to the 'Public Daily' of the provincial committee and organs newspaper, saying: 'The People's Daily has too many rules to criticize the manuscript.' I very much appreciated the provocative 'Wall of Democracy in Peking University' by Wen Wei Wei Bai, saying that this article was written well, and said that the democratic air in schools was high and that the democratic demands of teachers and students were high. He said that it was a splendid newspaper at Peking University, and it became black stickers at the Public Security Office. The leadership of the Public Security Department should learn from the first secretary of Peking University, and write a large print 'Let the black stickers see the sun as well.' He also wanted to change the nature of the Business Learning Materials Compilation and requested that it be centered on the material that was magnified and wanted to turn it into a forum for right-wing elements. He said that the scope of the panel meeting was too small to be addictive and called for a general assembly. At the panel meeting, someone refuted his reactionary view, exposing his illegal activities. He actually threatened others, saying, 'You give me advice, should be well considered...'\\nNi huanghe Huang River's hatred of the Communist Party was not accidental. Originally, he had no history. He participated in the Sanqing League as early as 1943, and later served as a reporter and editor of the pseudo-Zhejiang Daily and Commercial Newspaper, as editor-in-chief of the pseudo-China Junior Weekly, and also a field reporter of Jingwei News Agency, and war criminals Tong Enbo and the bandit Zhejiang Sun Yici, director of the information department of Jiang Province Province (Major General's agent), 69 army chief Li Zhen and others have exchanges and travel after liberation Mix in troops. Because of the complexity of the history, there had been a review in the army, and in 1955 the Public Security Department was also the focus of internal rebellion. He saw this as digging meat on him, who wrote down deep hatred against the party and always wanted to find a chance of revenge. This time the party carried out a windy campaign and called for enlarging it. He thinks that the time has come, under the banner of 'helping the party to rectify the wind', launched a rampant attack against the party and wanted to bring the Communist Party down. \\nOf course, his abacus was wrong. Now that the 'hero' attacking the Communist Party has fallen into a deus, with a song on all sides-all comrades from the Shandong Provincial Public Security Department are fiercely struggling against him, and his reactionary face and vicious heart have been exposed to the masses. Viper out of a hole bite, and then want to hide safely is impossible."}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached] Jin Ye: 'Ni Ni huanzhi, Zhao Qi, Wu Mingyong-Three Injuries of Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts' (2004.8.1/Paris)\\nIn the summer of 1958, the anti-right struggle of Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts (now China Academy of Fine Arts, the former National College of Art, Central Academy of Fine Arts in East China Branch), has ended. \\nWhile waiting for the final release, we, the delineated right-wing elements, were divided into groups and engaged in various forms of daily work in schools. \\nThis morning, together with Ni Ni huanzhi and Zhao Qi, I were pulling grass under the eastern corner of the playground. I ignored the mud master Huang Baogan came to greet them and took them away. I thought, it was probably called to announce it. I went home for dinner at noon, when I and Zhao Qi lived in the teaching staff dormitory in Qixia Ling. As soon as he entered the yard, he saw Huang Baogen with Zhao Qi out of his house. At that time, Zhao was carrying only a very simple luggage, and he did not see someone from Zhao's family to leave. I hurried to ask where he went? He said he didn't know yet. I watched him so badly and rushed out of the door by a friend of Huang's surname. Who knows that such a meeting was the last difference between me and Zhao Qi. \\nTeachers Ni Ni huanzhi and Zhao Qi died in labor reform\\nThe next morning, I just entered school, and I saw the teachers posted a bulletin on the billboard announcing that the right-wing elements Ni Ni huanzhi and Zhao Qi have been sent to justice by the judiciary because of their counter-revolutionary history. Soon I learned from their families that both were sent to a correctional facility in Fenghua and sentenced to labor. \\nAt that time, Ni Ni huanzhi lived with his family in Zhugong Temple dormitory in Waixi Lake. After Ni was sent to re-education, I visited his wife and children many times. Listening to his wife, Ni kept writing letters to his family, saying that the labour camp was very good for him, but living conditions were poor. So she had to send him something to eat often. At one time when she sent something, she was seen by a neighbor, and also had some gossip, saying that Ni really enjoyed it. Although such a person lived in the labour market, it was difficult to transform well. \\nNi's wife was a kind rural woman, when one of his boys was only 7 years old. After Ni was sent to re-education, the salary has been suspended. Under extremely difficult living conditions, they are constantly trying to send their husbands something to eat, hoping that he can return home at an early date. \\nZhao Qi's wife, Wang Shixin, was a mathematics teacher at the municipal third high school. After Zhao left, she raised four young children alone, and soon moved her home to the teacher's dormitory in the Third Middle School. At that time, our family also moved from Qixialing to Hong Chunqiao. Although our two families are far from each other, Wang has always come to my house to tell about Zhao's living conditions at the labor reform venue, and also specifically brought his letter to me. Sometimes sit late and live in my house. One day, she suddenly came and happily told me that Zhao might come back before the end of the year. I gave me a letter that I had just received. \\nZhao said in his letter that the managers in the field were very good for him and took care of him in labor, and it seemed likely that he would be put home before the end of the year for the New Year. \\nAt that time, I looked at the content of Zhao's letter and Ni's letter basically, and they were very good in his speech, but Zhao did not mention that he needed to send something to him to eat. By then, they had been in the labour market for less than a year, so I don't think it's going to come back so soon. The words written in each letter are nothing more than a word of consolation. Moreover, the letters they write are surely to be examined. As a result, the family could not be informed of the situation in practice. However, Wang believed that it was true. I couldn't tell her what I thought was so happy to see her. It was only three days later, I never thought that Wang actually ran home crying and crying to find me, holding a telegram in his hand, saying that Zhao was dead. The message of the telegram only wrote a few simple words: Zhao Qi died of illness on March □ and immediately came to the scene to deal with the aftermath. \\nThe king could not accept this cruel fact, when he kept crying, and his eyes were crying. With tears, she came back from the Fenghua labour camp and said to me that when she went there, Zhao's body had been cremated. As a result, she couldn't even see the face once. The field said that he was a potent, and did not know what illness he had, and died suddenly. According to the rules on the premises, all correctional prisoners who have died of illness must be cremated immediately. Wang felt her husband died too bizarre, but there was no comment, and finally had to bring a relic from her husband's life, a Swiss watch back home. \\nNi Ni huanzhi contributed greatly to translation art theory\\nShortly after Zhao Gang died, Ni was sent to Hangzhou First Hospital in the field, and his belly had been inflated. It was not long that he died from schistosomiasis. Wang's death was unknown. Always wanted to figure out exactly how he died? I asked her to go to Chen Long, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Academy of Fine Arts, and asked the College to come forward She came back and said to me that Chen's attitude was worse than the leadership of the labor market. Chen said: Zhao Qi is a prisoner in the labor camp. It is no longer a man in the school. How he died has nothing to do with our school. Moreover, it is a matter of course that a correctional prisoner's death in the workplace is a good place to die. What power do you have to investigate the cause of his death? \\nWhat are Mr. Ni Ni huanzhi and Mr. Zhao Qi? Today, there are fewer people in school who know them, and most of them have passed away, and fortunately I am alive. And both of them were very close to me both at work and in life. \\nBoth gentlemen were associate professors in our hospital. At that time, Ni Ni huanzhi did translation work in theoretical teaching and research group, Zhao Qi taught watercolor painting in the basic lesson group. Both groups were my responsibility in the early days of liberation. They were all of Jiang Feng (then Dean of the Central Academy of Fine Arts and President of the Chinese Artists Association), who came to Hangzhou to take over the school, specially hired from Shanghai. \\nNi Ni huanzhi, formerly known as Ni Youhe, Mr. Lu Xun had 13 students in Shanghai, including Jiang Feng and Ni Ni huanzhi. Ni and Zhao Qidu studied in Japan, Ni studied English at Japanese University, and Zhao studied western painting at Ueno Art School in Tokyo (now Tokyo Art University). After Ni returned to China, (during the war of resistance), worked on interpreters at the Military Command Department of the Chongqing Kuomintang Government and the US Information Office in Chongqing. After returning home, Zhao participated in the first national art exhibition held in China at that time. His watercolor works have been widely acclaimed. In search of work, he once worked as a propaganda in the KMT's three youth groups. He was dissatisfied with the rule of the Kuomintang, and with the revolutionary ideals, he ran to Xinjiang to rely on the best talent. At that time, Xinjiang warlords were studying the Soviet Union under the banner of revolution, so many aspiring young people were tempted to rely on him at all times. The famous film actor Zhao Dan was also like Zhao Qi at that time. It was during that period that time he went to rely on Shengshi talent. Who did not know long, Sheng suddenly changed his gossip to Chiang Kai-shek. Mao Zemin, a Chinese Communist Party who went to Xinjiang, was shot dead, and all the left-wing elements who had relinquished in Sheng were thrown into jail. Zhao Qi, like Zhao Dan, spent five years in a jail in Xinjiang. It was not easy to return to Yangzhou's hometown. \\nAfter the liberation of the country, Ni and Zhao were unemployed. In 1949, Jiang Feng and some comrades from the old liberated areas came to Hangzhou to take over the National Arts Department, struggling with insufficient teachers. He found Ni in Shanghai and also found Zhao through Ni's relationship. Jiang Feng thinks these two people are very rare teaching personnel. After they were arranged to work at school, they also felt that they had finally fulfilled their wishes for life, and found the best place to go home. \\nIn the early days of the founding of the country, all domestic construction needs to be learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In order to learn the advanced art theories of the Soviet Union, it is necessary first to understand the Russian language. So Ni and Zhao immediately tried to learn Russian on their own. At that time, the National Academy of American self-study Russian came to life. Among them, those who have achieved excellent results are rich Jingchang and Yang Chengyin. Ni presided over by Ni, published by the Early Theory Department. \\nIn 1956, at the invitation of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, I and Ni and Qian went to Beijing to help them establish a department of art history. In preparation for the establishment of the faculty, the first priority was to translate into Chinese the European part of the world's history of art by Arbatov, which was just published by the Soviet Union. The person who presided over this translation is Mr. Ni Ni huanzhi. \\nIt is pity that a country as big as ours has never had a decent history of European art, and none of the art academies have ever officially offered courses in the history of European art. Since the publication of these translations by the Fine Arts Publishing House, our readers have been able to learn systematically about the history of European art. It should be said that with Ni as the leader, anyone who had been involved in this translation work at that time was a great credit. \\nSince coming to school, Ni has put all his energy into the translation of art theory. He is fluent in English and Japanese, he studied Russian and also studied Greek, hoping to translate things directly from Greek ancient art theories in the future. He sees his work in theoretical art translation as a particularly sacred and noble cause. He is unfamed and deeply aware that only by expanding and enriching his knowledge in the field of art will it be possible to improve the art education and theoretical level of our country. This spirit of devotion is very valuable at any time, no matter what point of view! \\nZhao Qi doesn't know that the right equals death sentence\\nAlthough he did not translate much information after he learned Russian, he focused his energies on teaching and painting at that time. He cares very much about student performance and often says I can't mistake my children. And always draw new demonstration works to give students a look. He kept painting himself, and in addition to watercolors, his oil painting was solid. Every time I went home to see him, I saw him sitting in front of the window to draw. At one time, we took students to Lanxi internship, who painted watercolors outside almost every day. He drew a lot of dynamic, very vivid herds. The paintings were exhibited after their return to school and impressed the faculty and students of the College. \\nIn 1956, when I lived at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, one day, Zhao suddenly came to me, saying that he had never been to Beijing, this time he came here to paint. I arranged his accommodation and rarely saw him later. Because he got up early in the morning and bought two burnt cakes in his arms and ran out to draw, and with these two burns, a painting on the outside was a whole day. It can be said that at the time of all the teachers in our hospital, I did not know which paintings could be more diligent than him. At the beginning of the anti-right, he was not in school, went to the northwest to write students. I still do not know that the school had carried out this vigorous campaign. I don't know that the college had long identified him as the right. It was a special telegram from the school to rush him back to wear that right-wing hat. \\nOn the day he came back, it happened that we met at the entrance of the school. Remember he laughed, 'How did this happen, how did you become the right? It seems that calling me back is also fleeing. However, I would love to try what it tastes when the right is. \\nWhy did we know the amount of this right hat? The day after his return, the school couldn't wait to hold a conference, dividing him into the right. Whoever knew that for him, once classified as the right, the death penalty was imposed. \\nJiang Feng missed his old friend Ni Ni huanzhi very much. Once Jiang's right-wing problem was corrected and returned to Hangzhou again, he wanted to go with me to visit Ni's wife and children. But where he knew that, shortly after Ni was sent to labor, his family was driven out of the school dormitory, so that they were squeezed in a corridor in a corridor in the corridor of the corridor, and had only been very reluctant to put up a bed under the eaves of others. Our family visited them at that time, and then I was sent to Zhuji rural to reform and restructure my family no longer knew the whereabouts of their family. Jiang Feng heard that these afterwards had been silent for a long time, never speaking a word. \\nThe fierce face of Chen Long, party secretary of the far left\\nWu Mingyong graduated from the 50s. He suffered from lung disease during his studies, and for some time he was in a dormitory of 'a cloud' in isolated mountains. He likes to read, write articles, and often show me the articles he wrote. Among the students at the time was a very prominent theoretical talent worth training. After graduation, he was introduced to an internship in Beijing Fine Arts magazine and was an assistant editor. After a year, back to school to teach theoretical literature and art classes in the Theory Department, as my assistant professor, and helped me launch the journal 'Art Research' jointly organized by our hospital and the Central Academy of Fine Arts. He studied the Kingdom of Heavenly. He made many different views and written a paper on the arguments of the academic authority of the Pacific Heavenly State at that time. This article was published in the inaugural issue of Fine Arts Research. \\nWu was classified as the right-wing shortly after Chen Longlai, secretary of the party committee, who arrived in office. In Chen's eyes, regardless of his speech or performance, since my assistant is closely related to me, it is certainly the little right. Recall that when Chen was transferred to school, that kind of power could not but be repugnant. When he just arrived at school for the first time, he shouted at the congress: I came to you today at the Academy of Fine Arts, that is, the 'Minister of Chin Chin Chin Chin', and if you saw me in the feudal dynasty, you would have to kneel down. I heard about what 'three gold' in your school (meaning Jinlang, Jinye, Zhu Jinlou), said they were very powerful, very powerful. Nowadays 'three gold' (all become the right, see what else they can do, now really powerful is me... \\nThis 'Minister Chin Chin Chak', who came in, was really powerful, and didn't think he felt that the right wing drawn by this school was far from enough. In order to show his majesty, he immediately pushed the fight against the right back to its climax, and a large number of right-wing were drawn by his hands. For example, Deng Ye, Zhang Huaijiang, etc., before Chen Long came to school, it was a leader against the right, but in his hands all became the right. Despite this, he was prepared to circle some right among the old professors, and to try out all the professors in the school. When he sent the finished materials to the Zhejiang Provincial Committee, I didn't think that because there were too many right wing in the school, it had already far exceeded the predetermined percentage, so that many old professors were very lucky enough to escape the disaster. \\nThe tragic death of the young right-wing Wu Mingyong\\nWu Mingyong, who was classified as the right, was dismissed from public office, stayed in school and paid only 15 yuan a month for living expenses, and had been sent to Dongyang labour farm for re-education. When he returned to school after a year of labour re-education, he was already suffering from pulmonary disease and was assigned in a very damp, dark hut that never shines the sun. During that time, he sat with me for lunch at the cafeteria, and we were very poor at that time. \\nAt that time, he was in desperate need of nutrition and had to improve living conditions. I ran to the personnel section to deal with him for this. I can imagine that my old right does not have any role to speak for the little right. Soon, his condition worsened and, although he was hospitalized, was not properly treated. When I went to see him, I saw him living in a large ward packed with more than 20 beds, very noisy. He told me that he was rarely able to sleep since he was admitted to the hospital and that the room was noisy all day and night, making it difficult for him to catch his eyes. Plus dry stool, can not eat something. If you can change a ward and be able to sleep, the condition will naturally get better. I saw his dry mouth clots clots in the corners of his mouth and was very sad and rushed to the hospital's dean's room and asked to change his ward. I didn't think the director said to me: the hospital bed is very nervous at present. It would be good to know to be able to live in. How do you want to change the ward? I say that the patient cannot sleep, and it is your duty to make him rest every day. He said it's not my business. You should go to the doctor. If I came to me for such things, what would my dean work do? So I went to the doctor again. He said that when the patient first arrived, they were not sleeping well, and staying a few more days would be good. I said, could you give him a sleeping pill and something so that he could rest better every day? But the doctor said we would think about how to heal. I told Wu about the outcome of the intervention. I thought that since I could not change the ward, it would always be easy to do if I could give him some sleeping pills. Who knew that when I went to visit, his condition had deteriorated. He said he was still unable to sleep and drink only a little water every day. I went to the doctor again, and he said that his illness would have been difficult to cure, because it was sent from your school, so he lived in. We are still trying to heal him. That's why he died in the hospital without a few days. \\nFor more than 30 years, every time I thought of Wu Mingyong's death, it was very sad. If he had not been classified as the right because of Me, he would have died as miserable, he would have left the world prematurely. He was under 30 at the time of his death. \\nAfter Wu died, his brother came from his hometown of Minnan to deal with the aftermath for him. When his body was sent to the crematorium outside Fengshan Gate, in addition to me and my wife Dong Lin, there were old classmates who had been good in his life: Zhou Changgu, Xu Yongxiang, etc. Although Shen Yun-tang worked with him in the Theory Division, he has drawn a line with Wu since the reverse right. Who expected this day also came to the funeral. One of the most memorable things is Zhang Yanfen. \\nZhang Yuan is one of the youngest female students attached to the Academy of Fine Arts. He met Wu since then. She is often cared for by Wu because of her bad family situation and has always called him Angkor. Wu has also always treated her as her little sister in general, always maintaining such a pure and incomparable relationship between teachers and students. That day, she cried very sad. When Wu's remains were pushed into the crematorium, the body was covered with a white cloth sheet and only two feet without socks were exposed outside. Zhang couldn't bear to let her Angkor even bare feet near cremation, and immediately ran outside to buy him a pair of shoes and socks to wear on his feet. \\nWhen you stand in front of Wu's remains, I can't help but my grief, vigorously open the white quilt on him and said: Let's take a look at Wu Mingyong's legacy together! He was wearing a new blue cloth cadre suit, holding a double punch. His thin face has become completely black, with black blood clots around the corner of his mouth, close his eyes. It was clear that the expression died in extreme pain. \\nWhen I was criticized in the Cultural Revolution, Shen Runtang even stood up on stage and said, 'Wu Mingyong, this little right, really reactionary, has not said a word of gratitude to the Party to death. His reactionaries were entirely cultivated by Metallurgical, the dead old right. At the crematorium, when Wu was near cremation, the old right metallurgical also personally unveiled the shade cloth covered on him to demonstrate to us, telling us that Wu was persecuted to death. See how sad the old right metallurgy should be for the death of the small right that he had cultivated! \\nNi Ni huanzhi, Zhao Qi and Wu Mingyong, the right-wing grievances of three talented young teachers, were corrected in 1978, but almost half a century has passed since the anti-right movement has passed, and their lives and past wrongs have gone unheard.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】Mo Book: 'Lives at the Lake' (Peking University Press 2018)\\nThe third place of our dormitory in Peking University is the Kin Faar by the lake. \\nBeginning in 1972, the first days after marriage were spent on the 19th floor 304 in the South Gate of the North, when the 19th floor was a collective dormitory for Chinese faculty teachers. When living in both places, family visits and daughters were born, both took place on the 19th floor. The 19th floor is a cylinder building, from young teachers who have just stayed in school to single teachers who have not yet been solved 'two places', all live together. The oldest, such as Teach Ancient Chinese Ji Changhong, home in Shandong, everyone has become accustomed to his annual family visit career, he is the oldest 'cow lang'. Kim Shen Xiong (Jin Kaisheng), and Hu Shuangbao, who taught writing classes, lived in one room. They had a common hobby-Peking Opera, occasionally went to their house, and also saw Mr. Hu Shuangbao's collection of 'theater tickets' and 'program lists'. Jin Shen Xiong also wrote brush words and engraved stamps; these were seen as seal repair in the 'Cultural Revolution', and the room he lived with Hu Shuangbao was criticized as 'Jin Bao Zhai'. Mr. Kim Shen Xiong's wife and daughter are in Jiangnan, and are also permanently separated from the two places. Also interested in Peking opera is the ancient literary, Mr. Ju Sigui. At noon or evening breaks, often from his house the word is rounded. Qiu Xigui's mother is Shanghai, old lady a famous girl, met me in the corridor, said the whisper is often: 'Little, introduce us to a girlfriend, I really worried, alas...' to see our home food is really shabby, sometimes sent a small plate of delicious dishes. \\nAt that time, the old man who had not yet married, was not like now called 'single aristocracy', at that time seemed to be a lack of life, to help them. The same 'good year' and 'unmarried', or married and separated, living on the 19th floor there are Ni Qi-xin, Zhao Zumo, Hou Xuechao, Liu Xuan, Wang Futang, Xu Tongqiang and other Mr....\\nI heard that Mr. Ni Qishin's girlfriend is in Shanghai, and the marriage is still two things. Ni Qishin was classified as 'right' in 1957. At that time, many 'right-wing' were already 'hats off', but 'correcting' was only a few years later. He is one of the members of Peking University's famous colleague magazine 'Contemporary Heroes'. Le Daiyun, Chu Binjie, Fu Xuancong, Jin Shen Xiong, Shen Yucheng are the same group, all belong to the Department of Literary History. After wearing the right hat, his girlfriend left him. After many years, the scar seems to be healing gradually, Ni Qi's heart began to fall in love again. He smoked, stayed up late, pulled Erhu, the sound of 'River Water,' sometimes squeezed out of his door seams and fluttered in the aisle on the 19th floor; however, none of the pieces he pulled was complete. Usually he drink alcohol alone in the tavern in the tiger cave in Haidian town, two old white dried, a dish of peanut beans, spend half a day. When I read the Chinese department, the students have a handbook of 'Qin Literature History Reference Materials', 'The History of Two Chinese Literature History Reference Materials', 'Wei Jin North and South Korean Literature History Reference', the main information and notes are all his 'stupid kung fu' when he was doing 'right'. There is no substitute for these three books after learning, and probably no one will do such 'silly things' in the future. \\nMr. Hou Xuechao teaches modern Chinese. He was a cheerful man of 1.8 meters, when he was a student in the 50s, was once the backbone of the school track team, creating a school record of 400 meters. The record remained for more than 20 years and was not broken until the early 1980s. \\nAt that time, the story of Mr. Zhou Qiang, who taught classical literature, was a little legendary. It is said that one night, everyone is reading books in the room for classes, suddenly came Zhou Qiang shouting in the corridor: 'I'm married today, everyone came to eat watermelon!' Door doors were opened, quiet corridors immediately mess, we flocked into the 302 house, see 'bride' Mr. Bai Shu rong smiley standing at the table, the table full of cut watermelon...\\nRemember it was a Saturday in 1974, the last day of an art exhibition. I finished two classes at Peking University School, riding a bicycle into town and wanted to see that exhibition. At that time, the road from Zhongguancun to Baishi Bridge was divided into two sections, the north section called Haidian Road, the south section of Renmin University called Baishiqiao Road, and the fast trail was in the west, along the car, dirt road in the east, walking bicycles and pedestrians. At that time, there were few bicycles and people on the road. Ride near Wei Gong village, back to catch up with a lad, first in my left side walk side by side, handlebar close, then look at four nobody, suddenly the right hand hugged my neck. Suddenly attacked, I suddenly got out of control, even the car fell to the roadside ditch... After climbing up, a blood bag on the head, the bike reel variant, the kid has been riding out of more than 100 meters, still looking back, around a person did not... I put the bike half pushed half to Wei Gong A car shop in the village, then, take a car back to the 19th floor. I went to the door to find that my key, including the door key, all left in the Weigong village car shop. At that time, I sat down on the stairs and cried... and then seemed to come out, sir, as if I intermittently told the end of things. I remember clearly: Later I sat in the house of Mr. Ni Ni qixin to drink water. Mr. Wang Chunmao went to Wei Gongcun to retrieve my door key. Forgot where Hongzi-cheng went at that time. \\nLife on the 19th floor of memory is quiet and calm, usually there is little noise in the corridor. Break time everyone will also string doors to each other, if anything happens, will help. When there are nice programs, such as broadcast games, literary performances, put a 14-inch black and white TV room, will be lively, there are always more than a dozen or even 20 teachers, with a stool gathered in a room, excited to watch the ball, talk, and cheer loudly until the end of the event. \\nListen to Hong Zicheng, Mr. who does not watch TV on the 19th floor, one is Wang Fu Tang, which studies the Chinese dialect, and the other is Qiu Xigui; it is not surprising that their later learning did so well. However, there are exceptions when the 'Cultural Revolution', television rarely broadcast the British BBC Orchestra's performance in the Beijing National Palace Auditorium. Mr. Wang Futang stood at the end, always seeing the broadcast end. At that time, Mr Hung said it was Beethoven's Violin Concerto. \\nIn the early 1970s, the university began to resume classes and recruit trainees for workers and farmers. In addition to attending school classes, industrial and peasant cadets often go out to 'open school'. The Chinese Language Department selected a group of young, born and competent teachers to serve as class leaders. When 'opening school', it was the 'commander' who led the team in full power. They learn from classes, political activities, all the way to eating, sleeping, conflicting disputes. In addition to the class leaders, there will be a few less 'excellent' teachers to teach students classes, also eat and work together and receive education. Hung Tze-cheng often plays this role in the back. My classmates in the Chinese language department Tung Xuewen, Hu Jing Department and Fang Sid have all taken the team, and are all his leaders. Hong Zicheng 'open school' to many places, remember to visit the 63 army of Baoding, Hebei province, went to the Mentougou coal mine and Fangshan Dongfanghong refinery for half a year, and went to Tangshan disaster area after the 1976 earthquake. Mentougou coal mine most worries me, because it seems to have two wells a week digging coal, always afraid of what happened below. \\nIn 1974 or 1975, I transferred from the cunrui middle school in Longhua County, Hebei to Peking University, daughter Hongyue was only two years old. When Hong Zi Cheng opened school, my most troubled thing was my children. When working during the day, the child is sent to the kindergarten north of the school hospital and pick up the child after work at night. I cook, eat, prepare classes, judge homework, she plays in bed. She was trained to not cry or talk while her adult was doing things. When the time to sleep, but often found her two blush, panicked among a try table, often 39, 40 degrees. Every time I ran to knock on the door of Mr. Ni Qishin, Mr. Ni said nothing, immediately ran over to carry the child. We trot all the way straight to the school hospital, my daughter cried loudly on Mr. Ni's shoulders: 'I don't want Uncle Ni, I want my mother...' Mr. Ni ran while gasping education Hongyue: 'Mom does not move, we have to go to the hospital...' to the hospital, as usual, tetracycline injection, bring back one Pack antibiotics, the next morning, I can only send the child to kindergarten again. I still have to go to class. \\nOn the 19th floor days, mostly eating cafeteria, also bought a stove for burning honeycomb coal at the door. It was a small stove with a diameter of 25 cm, height up to 40 cm, hot rice, fried dishes, and even when I sat confinement to cook soup and bake diapers. Remember every night when the fire was sealed, Hong Zicheng was squatting in front of the stove, down his eyes close to the door, plug that small iron sheet, let the air inlet only a small slit, so that a piece of honeycomb coal can be on top of the night. He later attentive and experienced, to do it with 3 pieces of honeycomb coal a day can support this stove for a long time not 'out'. \\nPresumably 1975 (or 1976), we ended the life of the cylinder floor. Moving out from the 19th floor, the real estate department assigned our first 'home' in Zhongguancun. There are several of the academy dormitory buildings belonging to Peking University. We stayed on the 25th floor a 16 m2 house, shared with another small kitchen, toilet. The 25th floor of the Academy of Sciences frontage street (is now North Fourth Ring), the window car continues, especially to wudaokou railway station freight truck. Often until late at night, we listen to the truck from far to near and far away, windows and radiators next to the iron bed flutter in the roar of the car... When the car headlights are shot into the house, you can see the clock on the wall: one, two o'clock, three o'clock... all day to sleep well. We thought and thought that we still had to live on campus quiet. If you change the house, the house department of the school does not matter, but you can look for the object of the transfer of the room yourself. I went to the collective dormitories in conditions that were not as good as for the change of room. Hong Zicheng is a well-established, timid person who fears things, and feels that this approach is not appropriate. But he doesn't have any way. There was no result in two months. Finally, thanks to the introduction of Mr. Yang Hesong, a colleague in attached high school at that time, he changed the house with people and lived at the unnamed lake on the campus. This time again moved to the cylinder building, 13 square meters, is No. 304 Jianzhai on the North shore of the lake. Jian Zhai is just a room on the side of the sun, we can open the window to see the Lake of Unnamed Lake, the lakeside road of ginkgo trees, the island on the lake, the flower temple and water tower on the other side (then there was no 'Boyatta' Ya Tower). That makes us quite happy. Here, this stay is 6 years. \\nRemember to move from the 25th floor of the Academy of Sciences to Kin Zai, I borrowed two flatbed tricycle. Mr. Dong Xuewen and Hong Zicheng, each pedaling a car, pulled out all of our home: the school sold to us a bookshelf, a two drawers table, we bought our own iron frame double bed, a folding round table, two chairs, one covered roll, my cardboard box, Hong Zi-Cheng from the old Home to Peking University's old suitcase, there is a book, two bicycles, then the pot and spoon. \\nMost of the residents of Kin Zhai are a family member of a young teacher-two couples plus one child. There are also older, senior senior single teachers, or old teachers who are home in town and far away from the North Road. On the first floor of Kin Zai wet, no home is a 'guest house'. Remember that the second and third floor residents were from the Physical Education Department, Law Department, Department of Library Studies, Philosophy, Physics, History, East and Spanish. The Department of Politics (added 'international' in the 1990s, became the Department of International Politics, and its status suddenly increased), including Fang Lianqing, Huang Zhongliang, Pan Guohua and others. \\nImpressive and special sir quite a lot. Guan Yihan, a senior staff member of the library department, she had not been married. When the children first called her 'Grandma Guan', she always corrected them, so called 'Aunt Guan'. Librarian deputy curator is an old gentleman who does not cook, eat cafeteria. Teacher Yang of the Department of Physics was already associate professor at that time, and was single. People were very good, and some gloomy did not love to speak. Hung said he had burned a winter boiler at school in 1972. He married an old companion with a child while he was in good faith. Mr. Wang Yongxing was old and amiable. The children called his grandfather Wang, who later knew that he was a student of the famous ancient Chinese historian Chen Yinke. We live next door to Xiao Weiyun of the Department of Law. He should be home in town and often rest here only at noon. He did not squint and never greet the surrounding households, nor did I speak to him. It was only known that he was a professor of law and one of the main drafters of the Basic Law of Hong Kong and Macao SAR in the 1980s and 1990. Fang Lianqing of the State Department of State and Government at one time believed in the 'specific function', and at one time put a child of Jian Faist in his home to test 'ear listening to words'. There seems to be no result, but he still firmly believes...\\nThe south side of Jian Chai is close to Tisha (that is a large roof, square two-story small building), West is Dezhai, Caizhai, Junhaizhai, Junhaizai, prepare, north of a small road, with the whole fasting. Take the meaning of 'moral talent are bodily sound', most of these buildings were old Yanjing's buildings. At that time, people were accustomed to living in narrow, crowded cylinder buildings. Usually, the corridor is very quiet, when cooking, will be lively: cut vegetables, fried dishes, chat, children running around and shouting into a piece... then, eating is relatively simple. You can open water to mirror spring garden boiling water, staple bread, Hanamaki, meat rolls from Junzhai there cafeteria to buy, spend two cents to buy minced meat, fried a dish, make a soup, you can open meals. Or minced meat fried sauce, boiled noodles, drinking noodles soup, are the usual recipes for everyone. Come to the guests, that is, fried peanut rice, peel two loose eggs, to Haidian town to buy some cooked meat, even if it is 'grand'. So, almost half an hour later, the corridors were quiet again. \\nThe residents of Jianzhai do not have separate toilets, only the second floor east and west have public toilets, and there is a water room in the east. We live on the third floor, water, wash vegetables, take a shower on the toilet, also have to go downstairs. There is a huge water pipe under the water room, like a half-cut tank pool, can ensure that when washing dishes, washing clothes, dirty water will not splash a place. Residents on the second and third floors take turns on days, one week each. Without calling and reminding, everyone pays attention to public health; in turn, no one is lazy and sloppy, living near the toilet will not feel bad smell. Of course, unpleasant things happen occasionally. Once, it was my turn on the day, and when I was cleaning in the toilet at night, I found that the teacher on the second floor was a switch to flush the water with my feet. At that time, I said to an older woman, 'Do you take the switch dirty with your hands, you use your feet?' She used Shanghai cavity to say: 'Everyone learns to use feet, isn't it good?' I got nothing to say. Know that she will not correct, had to tell the neighbors, do not use your hands to twist the toilet switch, too dirty! She really let everyone learn a hand. \\nAt that time, Mr. Chen Yiwu, who taught classical literature from the Chinese Department, lived in Jingchun Garden 82 on the west side behind Jianzhai. That was a small courtyard. His wife (certainly did not have this name at that time), was Dr. Li Qingyue, the obstetrics and gynecology of the hospital. This courtyard was originally living in Mr. Wu Teumbing, and Mr. Chen Yiwu later moved in. After Mr. Wu moved to Langrun Park apartment, he came in two more. Mr. Chen lives in the east house, west and north house both live school logistics master. Remember the master name of the West Room 'come', the daughter called 'Lai Yi', that is Mr. Chen gave the name, 'there is a Fenglai Yi', very Qingya. This 'West Sun' position is the worst side of the yard, but Mr. Chen and Dr. Li have a very good way, but also very mood. Their children dig bamboo roots from the campus and planted bamboo canes in front of the north window, under the west window, and planted climbing plants. I can't remember it, just remember the 'West' room, even in the summer afternoon, but also the window bamboo branches swaying, the green shadows in the room. Three rooms, living four people, Mr. Chen and couple live in the north, small treasure and little sister live in the south, still leave a small living room in the middle. \\nWhen the 'Cultural Revolution' and the early 80s, the TV was still rare. Mr. Chen has a 9-inch black and white TV at his home. Sometimes, our family of three, had dinner to see TV at Mr. Chen's house, and they were always warmly welcomed. In the tiny 'living room' of less than 10 square meters, the three of us sat in the best position with their daughters in the middle... But we don't go often because they feel too disturbing their lives. \\nMr. Chen and Dr. Lee love our daughter Hong Yue. Remember once they took Hong Yue out to play, when she came back, her daughter was wearing a mask of Sun Wukong, portable gold hoop stick, very magical. Mr. Chen pleaded: 'has bought pig eight rings, half the way and repent, had to go back for Sun Wukong.' Dr. Lee laughed around: 'The road let us two line up, she was beside the captain, shouting one, one, one, one, and always criticized us for not getting neatly.' Looks like Hongyue was more 'crazy' than in front of us when he was with them. \\nMr. Chen has dinner every night and walks around the lake. Often shouted downstairs in Jian Zhai: 'Hung Zi Cheng down!' Usually reluctant to go downstairs Hongzicheng, also had to go down. Two people sitting on the rocks by the lake, East Lasi pulled. \\nThe best winter on the lake, the lake is iced, college students in ice sports classes, learn skating, school kids paddle a small ice car. Like others, I also found a wooden board, that is 30 cm long, 20 cm wide, under two triangular iron, and two small stakes plugged with a sharp iron stick, an ice car was done. The child kneels on the ice car, holding back, and the ice car will fly forward. After school, the kids are running between the skating adults, and the lake is a joyful yelling. Ice skating cars are the most obsessed activities of children in Hong Yue and Kin Zhai in winter, do not want to go home every evening for dinner, the end is often an adult carrying an ice car, followed by the mouths of the children upstairs. \\nAt that time, the masks, skating cars, jumping bands were children's daily games. At that time, every week I gave my daughter a few cents, one fifth of cream popsicles, one third of red fruit popsicles, a bag of five rice flowers, a pack of three corn flowers, and one piece of fruit sugar. I've seen my daughter after school, in a small shop opposite the North DadaEast Gate, the head close to the store's glass counter, probably didn't want to buy anything... it is really incredible to think of the changes in the world. At that time, the two of us paid 110 yuan, the kids didn't have games, computers, laser pistols... but their health and happiness seemed to be no less than their children now. It is clear that 'happiness' is not proportional to the growth of 'money'. \\nIn 1981, according to the length of service and age, Hung Tze-shing was eligible for the first time in the allocation unit. We are all excited. First post the list of people participating in the distribution at the door of the Real Estate Section, line up according to the qualifications, then post out the house to be assigned, and then select the house according to the queue order. Since he went to school early, Hong is the youngest among teachers of the same qualifications. By the time it is his turn, there is no more to choose from. We were divided into the 27th floor of Wei Xiu Garden, No. 313, two houses in the Sun. The air cannot be convection, but we are still very happy. Wei Xiu Garden is not on campus, in Peking University West Gate Road. \\nIn that year, Hung Tze Cheng was sick. I was going to graduate from the Academy of Social Sciences, and Hong Yue went to third grade at Peking University. We are divided into old houses that have lived for many years. There was no decoration team at that time. The real estate department gave us the decoration material is a large piece of white powder, a small packet of potato flour, so that we will brush the walls white. The three sisters who are studying at Peking University helped me, first with a shovel to eliminate the grease from the kitchen floor, then use kitchen knives to eliminate the old wall skin of the roof and wall, then pull back two sack sawdust from the school's wood factory and spread on the cement floor (to prevent the brush wall from sticking to the concrete floor). We prepared two large bathtubs, shengled back mixed with potato powder, bought a few pen-like brushes, and also took a scaffolding in the room, please come to Mr. Zhao Zumo, my classmate Wang Yongkuan, Mr. Yang Juchen of North Normal University, everyone wearing a paper hat, dry in the house One day, they were full of white powder, and then they went home for dinner...\\nThis scene makes me remember deeply, probably not only because, in fact, as a 'chief executive' but painted layman, Mr. Zhao Zumo, boiled potato flour into a pot of 'pimple soup' (potato flour is a binder, should be cooked like glue, stirred in a diluted white powder), not just because That big white paint to the wall is always hanging, and finally the heart and inside the show Wang Yongkuan Think of brush a layer of white powder, then brush a layer of latex, that big white powder is hanging... but because in that era, people and people are simple and sincere relationship. That relationship has long been remembered because it is not tied too much to 'money' and 'interests'. \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 6"}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】Gao Lan Mountain: 'Life Scam' (May 4, 2012)\\nMy life endured too many scams. In 1945, the small Japan surrendered, and the northeastern light was restored to me to know that I was a Chinese. This is a child who has just learned to recognize his ancestral identity, the trauma of the mind is unspeakable. July 5, 1948 Zhang Mingju, commander of Beiping garrison district, mobilized troops to suppress and shoot Northeastern students who petitioned not to be cannon fodder. I was one of the few who witnessed the 7.5 incident. Let me see the essence of the KMT's corruption reactionary. In a painful tear, I vowed not to share the days with the KMT. In 1949, I was passionate about the torrent. He Wei, former member of the Underground Democratic Youth Alliance, joined the New Democratic Youth League in August. In September (a month before the opening ceremony), I became the first secretary of the junior high school affiliated to Furen University (now Beijing 13). Later on, under the motto 'Everything for Socialism,' I need not say much in my student age. \\nOnce upon a time, at the turn of spring and summer 1957, I have graduated for two years and worked as a technician at the foundry workshop of Shenyang Second Machine Tool Factory (China-Czech Friendship Factory). When I buried my head in the workshop technical work, Zhang Guozhen, secretary of the party branch of the workshop suddenly looked for me. I thought he wanted to talk to me about my party membership. I didn't expect him to say to me, 'I heard you wrote something reactionary.' His words really made me inexplicable. It took me half a day to think of it. I wrote a lot of journals in my student age. He said, 'Can you take a look at it?', 'Of course, I ask to join the party to let the branch know me, I still ask for it.' So I ran back to a single dorm and pulled out all the diaries since 1949 from the boxes under my bed, six or seven had landed enough to be one foot tall. At this point, I think of the desk in my office there was a graduation work first anniversary in order to write a self-written summary of my mind, all my head was handed over to the party branch. Never thought, this summary was actually the lead of my life into the abyss. \\nPeople have clearly told you that it was 'writing some reactionary things,' and I knew it beforehand, but I didn't link the reactionary to myself at all, and I could not think there. I never thought it was privacy and shy away from others, and I never thought about using it to show off to others. Diary to see for yourself, but not afraid of others to see, light and fall, how fears the world! So handing over my diary is not only a burden for me, it's extremely easy on the contrary. 'I was not happy, and I thought that the desire for many years to join the party was about to do so.' \\nHalf a month later, the workshop director Zhao Yanjing asked me to talk. He is a member of the branch organization. I feel full of heart that he was looking for me on behalf of the branch to talk to me about the party issues. Naturally, I want to push his belly with him. Zhao Yanjing faces me, the first big fool of the day, so I can't help but talk down to say leak: 'You are frankly, I admire. In particular, you could hand over that diary, I didn't think. Your old Gao is indeed a very honest person...' Zhao Yanjing, on behalf of the Party branch, publicly admitted that they had peeped at my diary beforehand. Two years later, in 1959, I remembered that my desk lock in the spring of 1957 had been buried. \\nIn the summer of 1957, a day at work factory department suddenly affixed to the big print newspaper that criticized Gao Lan Mountain, and overnight I became a ghost. From my about 1.8 million words from my diary, the anti-right office extracted more than a dozen words about 100 words out of context, typing and printing the whole factory to fight. My summary of the first anniversary of my work was side-by-side, so I said it was just a lead. I went away in 1960 because I could not stand this grievance and was sentenced to 15 years of additional sentence (deprivation of political power), for counter-revolutionary crime. Not I pry the Communist desk, but the Communist Party pry my desk, and I became a criminal, and that was the logic of that era. 18 years later in 1978, the right was rectified, some old people met me and said to me that in the year, all over 600 people in the workshop knew that Zhao Si prying my desk and beaten me into the right, just put me alone in the drum. Zhao Sijing named a technician, in fact, every day not working on the party branch, in 1959 not only joined the party but also became party branch secretary of the foundry workshop, former secretary Zhang Guozhen was promoted to the chairman of the factory trade union. By creating false and false cases, stepping on people's blood and tears and grabbing official Lu, one of the Communist Party's stories can be seen from my life experience. \\nMy class graduates totaled 36, and four were beaten into the right in 1957:\\nZhou Tingbin, technician, Shanghai Xinzhong Power Engine Factory (Automotive Accessories Factory);\\nTang Fuyan, technician of Dalian Heavy Machinery Plant;\\nWang Xingtang, technician of Shenyang third machine tool factory;\\nWu Boyao, director of Foundry Department, Shenyang First Technical School (now Shenyang University of Technology);\\nI included a total of five people, including Wu Boyao committed suicide in 1958 and Tang Fuyan jumped to the cliff in 1959. \\nOur class is a microcosm. By this proportion, it is assumed that national college and secondary graduates were hit as right-wing, wronged and killed, that would be a very impressive number. \\nMao Zedong himself is intellectuals. However, what he fears most hates in his life is intellectuals, because intellectuals make sense and reason, and to combat intellectuals is necessary for authoritarian and foolish people. In 1956 and 1957, the people of Eastern Europe set off a wave of opposition to dictatorship demanding democratic freedom. Mao Zedong feared that the wave would spread to China. He made a 'masculine' to destroy the dignity of all intellectuals and seal their mouths, and the whole nation was chilling, and all the people of the mainland were stinging under the authority of him and his regime. Through the anti-right situation, he then engaged in a 'great leap forward', starving to death between 30 and 40 million Chinese people. The cultural revolution, which is the essence of cultural destruction, hit every mainland, 100 million people have been fought for 10 years, 20 million people have become wrongs, tens of millions of young students have lost their path to schooling, and China's economic culture has been set back for decades. As the Communist Party deliberately conceals distortions of history, today's young people do not know the true modern history of China, and people still live in scams. Forgetting history is the greatest sadness of a people, and it is the most worrying of our generation of years. \\nLooking back at this life, I feel that the biggest scam suffered is Marxism and Communism. I have been educated by the Communist Party since my childhood, and Marx's so-called 'materialistic view' and worldview are deeply rooted. Even if I became the right to become a counter-revolution, the communist faith has not changed. In the early days of reform and opening up, this faith collapsed with the day, it was a painful process. Find yourself in this life let people play as a monkey, the pain is extreme! \\nIn April 1974, the United Nations convened its sixth special session. China sent Deng Xiaoping to lead a delegation to New York. The central government urgently ordered all banks in the country to collect the dollar and find out $38,000, which was all China's foreign exchange reserves at that time. Deng Xiaoping led the delegation to New York with all the members of the US dollar reserves in China's treasury, paying rent, deducting the necessary expenses of daily life such as eating. Finally, the Chinese delegation returned home to the hall without the money to tip the waiters. Deng Xiaoping had to tip all his personal expenses to the hotel waitress, and he came home to bring back only a piece of chocolate from the table to his granddaughter. This is a silhouette of so-called socialism in the Mao Zedong era. \\nWhen I was a middle school student, I had a naive and naive idea that the liberation of Taiwan would not need the PLA to fight; because we had a superior socialist system, our productivity would be faster and far more than Taiwan. The Kuomintang that lives in Taiwan is decay. Their stalls of stalls will surely fall, and it is inevitable that the Taiwanese people turn to the mainland. Decades have passed on to tell me that at the beginning of the reform and opening up, it was precisely the capital of Hong Kong and Taiwan that saved an impoverished and desperate continent. It is not that the mainland liberated Taiwan, but Taiwan liberated the mainland. \\nNowadays, those powerful people still argue with their conscience that we 'never engage in the Western set'. In fact, it is precisely the Western set that created wealth, which caused them to have their brains full of fat. Take a look at the so-called civilization in China today, which is not the Western set? All they do not want to do is a democratic constitution and do not want to return to the people. More than 60 years later, the Kuomintang in Taiwan has become a party to prostrate the popular opinion; the Communist Party has also become a corrupt party that has failed to catch up with 10,000 Kuomintang in 1948. The power dispute within the Communist Party is intensifying, and social people are on the verge of morality. They are still claiming 'Wei Guangzheng', greedy God for their own. Is a society backed by lies, can it be long!? \\nWorld convergence, human convergence is an unstoppable trend of historical development. China's modern history must have a day of chaos anyway.

In the field of natural science research, scientists should be allowed to explore practice, not to prejudge conclusions and avoid the mistakes of the Soviet Union's one-sided support of the Lee Sen Scientists against Morgan's genetics doctrine (the latter proved more correct); secondly, to oppose bureaucracy to improve the Party's style, there is a need to strengthen the understanding of all levels Supervision of cadres. Given that leaders are usually afraid or unwilling to supervise leadership, advocate that the supervision, the judiciary should not be led by a party committee at the same level and have relative independence; third, considering the selfish side of humanity (the spontaneous tendency of farmers, workers' unionist tendencies), the Soviet Union had to depart from the early days of the revolution.

Tang Suzong changed its name to Tongcheng. After the 'liberation', the southeast part of Tongcheng was divided and rebuilt Zongyang County. When the Han Wu Emperor from the Xunyang Floating River down, in this shot dead Jiang Jiao, once vigorously wrote 'Sheng Tang (place name.

On the southern part of the town, on the banks of the Zongyang River, there is also the ancient site of White Crane Fung College, and the town's Chen shrine was the front-line headquarters of the liberation army in 1949 when it crossed the river. \\nRelatively speaking, Zongyang Old Street is a bit of decay. Removing half of the widened streets, the rest is still some narrow alleys and crowded old houses. Organ schools and hospitals have been relocated successively, and few valuable historical remnants have not been repaired as they should. A faction of poverty is broken down.

There is also a white lake inside the embankment, south to Anqing suburbs, west to the foot of the Huashan. The lake is scattered with a few green spirits, that is, Luo Originally from Zongyang, now belongs to Anqing. At the end of the Qing, my family moved from there to the temple alley at the foot of Zongyang Fenghuang Mountain. \\nAccording to the grandfather, my family's nine Zu Ni Yingjuan Ming Ming for the Temple of Taipu, after the death, the tenth Zuraofu public failed, refused to descend, into the mountain (Shucheng Beigu an, also known as Beigu an), as a monk, and commandment the children not to Shiqing.

When I was at home, I saw their poetry. There is a poem 'Liancheng to see peach flowers.' In the context of the difficult times of the country at the end of the Qing Dynasty, in the face of the beautiful spring light of the 'mountain and mountain peach tree', a weak girl in a girly woman grows out the generous verses of 'dyeing the blood of the mountains and rivers', is very shocking. \\nMei Xuan, Ju Xuan widowed her family.

Most of the young women in Zongyang at the end of the Qing Dynasty were taught in both schools. Was hailed at that time. 'Fenghuang Hill Road, Peach Li into the Spring'. \\nGrandfather Ni Yannong (1876-1961), was a kind old man in my early impression. After the Xinhai Revolution, the Chinese Revolutionary Party, who participated in Mr. Zhongshan, opposed Yuan Shikai imperial system.

If the disease is cured, someone will also send a home-raised chicken to thank you. Family fields are not many, tenants owe rent, a plea, is a confucianism, peace, clean and humble gentlemen. A bandits rob wangjia ditch fish polder, put the guarding personnel together into a room. I heard a bandit pointing to his grandfather, saying, 'Old Mr. is a good man, don't be hard for him.' Therefore, although my family's fish polder shares are not many, the vicinity of Zongyang is an intersection between the Japanese occupied area and the Jiang Guan District. The security is not good. Every year, the shareholders push their grandfather to host. \\nNinghan split in 1927. Some leftist revolutionary personalities including Communist Party Zhou Xinmin and others, also took refuge from the provincial city of Anqing to our home, and then fled to the field. After liberation grandfather became an enlightened gentleman and was elected as the Zongyang County people's representative. He was often asked to say a few words at meetings. Later, he donated artifacts such as porcelain word paintings from his family since the Ming Dynasty, and possibly a small number of gifts from the Ming Dynasty North Korea (the ninth ancestors who were sent to North Korea in the Ming Dynasty), to Was hired as a librarian in Anhui literature and history, a monthly salary of 50 yuan as his old-age living expenses. At the Great Leap Forward, he donated the first two houses of his home (the hall, the back hall and the house that my mother lived in as a child), to run the cafeteria. He died in 1961, at the age of 86. \\nAt present, in addition to the 97-year-old uncle who has moved to Anqing is still alive, the older generation has died.

After the failure of Yuan, Bai Liewu stepped down, this matter is no longer mentioned. It was not until after liberation, the Zongyang River was successfully truncated in the vicinity of the Baihe Feng, realizing the aspirations of the people of three counties (Zongyang, Tongcheng, Huaining), \\nIII. The Tribulation of Childhood (National Dismemberment)\\nMy name is Ni wansun (Wansheng), Anhui Zongyang. Born in Anqing on May 14, 1930 (April 16). His father Ni Suyi (Yuju, 1899-1994), after graduating from Tongcheng middle school, worked in an ocean line in Tianjin, after a long term as a primary school teacher and accounting work. Mother Zhang Yiwu (Duojia, 1902-1943), was born poor, grandfather opened tofu shop for a living. The mother studied hard and received funding from the church to complete high school. Because English is good, he is a secondary school English teacher. I have two sisters, Watson (1932-), and Kwai Sang (1934-2010). Sister Nien Chi (1928-), was born of the former mother Chick. She died when she gave birth to her sister. \\nMy family is a feudal family with little income. Grandfather does not cure his livelihood, the big man is talented and unable to work, at that time, the young uncle is still studying, the father is a primary school teacher with low salaries, all rely on grandmother (1874-1952), diligent family, difficult days. Naturally, the daughter-in-law is also very harsh. His father's ex-wife, child Zhike, is a child daughter-in-law, and suffers The big aunt Wu Qihua is sick, still has to work hard, often endured. Mothers are financially self-reliant and do not want to be subject to that kind of regulation. After marriage, a small family will be established. Put the old house first into repair, plus the floor and floor, into two floors, living alone. This may be a deep reason for her indifference to the feudal family. \\nMy parents pamper me as a child. My mother went to teach in the field, and I was home with my father, my father went out to rub mahjong, and always took me around. Began reading reading from the age of five to six. In the spring of 1937, my father taught at the Gong Huabiao Primary School in Zongyang countryside. After washing hands in class, slipping down field doi, water Asakusa more, fluke caught water grass, climbed up. In autumn, Zongyang Tao Gongsi Primary School was changed to third grade. At this time, the seven seven incidents have occurred, the day Kou made a big invasion. The profound catastrophe of the Chinese began, and my carefree childhood ended. \\nIn the winter of 1937, Nanjing fell. I heard that Yu Xuezhong Department, who had fallen down from the front line, was going to pass through Zongyang, the department's military discipline was bad, and people were troubled My mother and sister and I fled to Hexi Township near the rainy Tangang. Return to Zongyang after about a month. \\nIn the spring of 1938, due to tension, day Kou may commit at any time, the school is no longer open. I'm out of school and my parents are unemployed at home. My mother was in bed, and dad gave some out of school children in my hall. At this time, the two uncle who moved behind the factory in Shanghai, went to Guilin, Guangxi. Fear that two aunt dragging children on the road difficult, family hope to have relatives accompanied by care. Uncle newlyweds Yaner refused to go. Just mobilize the father. Although the father hesitated, but still went, despite the fights of war, blocked thousands of miles, and then gathered somehow year, put a bunch of children (at this time I was 8 years old, Hua sister 6 years old, only 4 years old, my sister was only 10 years old), to the unemployed sickness wife, and left with patience. Causes the pain of the mother helpless, premature death, and childhood suffering of children. \\nWhen his father left, the situation became more and more tense. Neighbor Uncle Lu Jiao installed a radio, and every night many youths, and young me, gathered in his house to listen to the war in Xuzhou. The news of Taierzhuang Dajie caused this group of young people to boil, cheered, jumped, busy on the street post post. But soon Xuzhou still fell! \\nSummer, day Kou along the Yangtze Jiangxi offended Wuhan. Zongyang is located on the edge of the river, on the way into the enemy west, my mother takes us to refuge to the mountain countryside. Because of the number of children and daughters, their young age, a mother could not care, had to foster Hua sister in the four aunts (mother's cousin, grandfather only one daughter), home. In the countryside, our children go up to the mountain and pick up wild mushrooms during the day (a lichen that grows on the sand after the rain), fear bandits kidnapping at night, I sleep in other villages with the cousin Ho of two's family. After that day Kou only occupied Anqing, and did not invade Zongyang, we went home again. \\nHowever, day Kou did not let Zongyang go. In the early winter of the year, several enemy aircraft suddenly bombed Zongyang. We hide in the bamboo forest behind the garden, watching enemy planes hovering in the sky, machine guns fire, throwing bombs. Adults want little children not to sound. Suddenly, my house was blown up in the kitchen. Fortunately, the bomb is small and close to us, but we have no one injured. Later it was heard that more than 30 people had been killed in the street, some bodies hanging on the poles, flesh and flesh flourished. Fear of frightened, Mom doesn't let us go to the street. Zongyang is not able to live. And we fled to the city of Chen Zhuang, a lake separated from Zongyang. Soon, day Kou occupied Zongyang. Since then, until the death of our mother in 1943, we all lived in the city and the countryside. At the beginning, the day Kou, stationed in Zongyang, often went to the country harassed and burned Later, Kou did not have enough troops, curled up in Zongyang, not even the city to loot. \\nIn the countryside for more than five years, my life was very hard. \\nIn the autumn of 1941, I went to Renaissance Secondary School. The KMT government said that the school had Communist activities and forcibly disbanded the school. At that time I was only an 11-year-old teenager who didn't understand anything, but the innocent was out of school. In the second spring, my mother, because I had only been in primary school for one year, afraid of bad mathematics, sent me to Cha Shixiang Primary School for six. Tutorial arithmetic and common knowledge lessons not learned at home. I was admitted to Fusan High School in autumn. \\nThe school is more than 50 miles away from home and is required to live in school. In addition to my daily expenses, my mother has to raise my tuition and meals. The father did not send money home for a long time. In 1942, Kou attacked Xianggui, but there was no news. In the midst of the war, no one in the countryside wants to send their children to study, mother books are not taught, and the family economy is very difficult. Food was not enough to eat, had to famine with wild vegetables and water hyacinth in the pond (when mobilized dad to leave home, promised to help us when difficult, then did not lend a hand). Difficult days, mother's mood is very miserable. In the summer of 1943, when the Japanese devils caught cousin in Zongyang, his mother was frightened, went home ill, more than ten days of high fever. Countryside can't find a doctor, our three children just hurry. Suddenly one morning, mother burned back some, to drink porridge. We were all very happy, which knew it was back to light back. At noon, at noon on August 5, 1943, my dear mother died at the age of 41. \\nToday it seems that the mother's disease may be typhoid fever and is completely curable. Mother's premature death was the result of the aggression. When the poor mother raved at high fever, she said that the school had hired her to teach, and the two sisters were going to school. She was most assured before her death was her children. After the mother died, there were parasites crawling out of the mother's nostrils. This parasite is a mama hard to save, for her son to go to high school to earn tuition, dig wild vegetables to eat water hyacinth brought. Think of this, what makes me a Son of Man! Seventy years have passed, writing here, I still can't control my feelings and can't stop tears. Poor mom, great mother! The economic situation of his son today is much better than then, but 'the son wants to keep and go away'. 'Who speaks of grace, can report three chunhui?' \\nWhile studying at Peking University, I also dreamed of mother, merciful Yan is still a man. Once a dream of poetry-\\nLake night moon cold villa, dwarf house lone lamp disease Alang. \\nTears Crystal Mercy, ask where can I return home? \\nMother coffin originally placed on Liancheng Yangjiazui Mountain. In 1958, he was buried by his father, but no monument was set. In 1982, I went home to sweep the tomb. It is not easy to find the old farmer in the neighbouring village who was responsible for the burial of that year, identifying the mother's grave. After more than twenty years apart, even though he had doubts, he had to make a monument and sacrifice, and a copy of the thoughts and heart of his son. In 2004, there was to repair the road, and buried the Yinlongshan cemetery near Niushoushan, Nanjing (No. 11, 2nd row of Shengzi 02 District). In 2007, I also bought a cemetery for myself and my wife at the cemetery. If there is a soul, I hope you can accompany the mother after death. \\nAfter my mother died, my sister and I stayed in Zongyang Big Aunt's house. A few acres of fields left by her mother were also run by the Big Aunt (until 1949 'liberated', land 'returned' to farmers). I dropped out of school and read books on my own. Anyway, I have a lot of books in my home, from online loading books to libraries, from subepisodes of history, poetry fiction to science books, read with me. Hua sister is 11 years old, helping her sister do housework. Kwai sister is only 9 years old, can not do housework, arranged to live in the grandmother. The big aunt gave her mother a portion of her income to her grandmother. From the spring of 1944 to the summer of 1945, Zhou Xinmin (the underground party of the Communist Party of China), and other progressive people came to work in Anhui. She went to Lihuang (that is, Jinzhai, the seat of the Kuomintang provincial government during the war), and her sister lived in Zongyang grandmother. I went to Tongcheng (the Kuomintang rule area, the day Kou occupied only along the river line), Lu Tingyi countryside relying on my grandfather. He was there presiding over the Shuni clan genealogy I was very concerned and asked a Mr. Yin to teach me the language. Mr. Yin taught me the ink. This is very different from the Confucianism I have been exposed to in the past. But at this time I aspire to learn Yue Fei, grow up against Japan to kill devils, save the nation, and love not attack that set, it is difficult to accept. \\nAfter his father fled from Guilin to Chongqing, in the summer of 1944, finally sent a letter and sent me the tuition fee. Fall I went back to Fusan Middle School. Sister Hua is still doing housework at the big aunt's house. \\nDagu Ni Zhujun has a certain cultural literacy, can say, take off generous, write a good word. As a young woman studying in Anqing, she had been influenced by progressive thinking, joined the KMT left wing and met some progressive people such as Zhou Xinmin (underground party), and so on. Ninh Han split Chiang Kai-shek openly against the Communist Party. She also helped some progressive people flee. Later she married to the earth to advocate home. The husband died prematurely and the clan failed to produce, she became the rich, and life was gradually extravagant. Although verbal sympathies with the revolution, the actions are intrigued, self-thoughtful, and faded out of the revolution. Unfortunately, her beloved one-born girl (Zhang Fuxu, four years older than me), died earlier. Temper is getting grumpy. No one wants to go to her house as a babysitter. She had to use her sister Hua sister and her husband's nephew (Zhang Chuzhao wife), to do housework for her. But not treat them well. Frequently scolded, fists and feet. Not even allowed to eat. Nephew's nephew was sick, could not stand ill treatment, and died of illness Huamei still has broken scars on her face so far. \\nSister was beaten for the longest time (1939-1947), and finally a little sister (Ni Zhuang Shou), can not bear the mind, to introduce the sister (Tong Zo Mo), to marry, is only out of the bitter sea, at this time the sister is already 20 years old. But the big aunt is better for me. I've been learning by reading books. Do not ask. This may be the idea of the old society's preference (my father is only my son), or it may be my usual stay in school, but only in her house during the winter and summer holidays. \\nDuring the 'liberation' war, she opened a business store in Zongyang, while loaned the house to the KMT local armed leader Liu Dongxiong and lived in a long relationship with the town, while treating Zhou Xinmin's daughter, and bail the arrested 'co-spy' Zhou, where he had a winding round on both sides. After the 'liberation' she spent her family money, first went to Anqing female middle school to teach, and then to work in Beijing. He was sent home in 1954 and lived on my grandfather. During the Great Leap Forward in 1959, he died after writing a letter reflecting the suffering of the people, against the three red flags against the revolutionary crime. \\nWar of Resistance in 1945. His father moved to Shanghai with the factory. In the spring of 1946 returned to Zongyang to visit, take Kwai Yi to Shanghai. Sister Hua sister asked to study. She immediately attended Zongyang Elementary School five. She studied in the morning and was still doing housework in the afternoon, until she was admitted to Anqing's female secondary school in 1947. Her sister did not attend primary school until 1947. At this time, the big guru opened business, eating and living in the shop often, household work is less important. \\nIn summer 1946, I graduated from Fushan junior high school and admitted to Anqing High School. Despite good results in literature and history, it is determined to learn physics in the future, build nuclear weapons for China and take the path of scientific salvation. High dichotomy, I decided to choose the science section. The school was the best middle school in Anhui at that time, strong teachers, good learning style. Through my efforts, my grades in science have also improved, and received a provincial scholarship every year. \\nFourth, to participate in the revolution before and after-the flaming era\\nIn order to determine which university to go after graduating from high school, in 1948, I went to Shanghai father's office and visited Jiaotong University. The rise in student movement in Shanghai gave me a lot of shock and excitement. The wall is everywhere. What 'hunger against persecution and civil war' is unheard of. After returning to Anqing High School, I decided to engage in student activities in our class as well. Civic students engaged in entertainment dinners. Xu Zhitao, who loves singing, teaches you to sing, 'quirky songs' with the ironic status quo, there is an outrageous 'good place over the mountain', and people organize the extracurricular labor, and I and Wu Xinghua are responsible for editing and publishing the 'Tuk Line' wall newspaper. Once a week, never stop. These, reflecting the restlessness and restlessness of young students at the time. In the school classes we became a heterogeneous, but there was no political tendency (after liberation it was known that our school did not have underground party activities). Grade content is just a general literary work of classmates. The school may have paid attention to us, but it did not interfere. Later one day military training instructors (the KMT high school conducted military training, and military training instructors in the school), beaten my class Hao Zhao at the Central Central for Xiaozhao. People are excited to ask for a strike training class. There was a special issue of protest against atrocities. The training director tear the wall newspaper overnight and told us, 'The situation was tense (at that time, Liao Shen, the Huaihai campaign was ongoing), not to be alarmed', the classmates also went. During the winter vacation, the school withheld the results notices of me and Wu Xinghua. At that time, the three major battles were over, the Northeast, North China and Xuzhou have all been 'liberated', and the general situation of the KMT has gone. I decided to leave the school to pick up liberation. At that time, a poem was written, of which a few words were\\nYou pedal snow and ice\\nCross the Mangtai, climbed over the mountains\\nYou guys are finally here.\\nIn 1949, Tongcheng was liberated by local PLA forces. The two ethnic groups of Zhou Xinmin, I left Zongyang, the Kuomintang rule, from Liancheng Trail via Yitsu Bridge to Lujiang Okukuguchi Zhoujia, and then went to Tongcheng. Just as the second campus of Anhui public school enrolled in Tongcheng Literature Temple, I immediately went to register and participated in the 'revolution'. A new life, a new battle begins. Trainees were mainly young students and young teachers, and there were also a small number of unemployed persons. Anqing high school students are only me and Ding Guang one or two. I renamed Xiao Guang in order for the KMT family not to be implicated. After the liberation of Anqing was restored to its original name. \\nTake part in the revolution's learning life for the first time, fresh, excited, full of passion. Our four-pound backpack, including comforters, sheets, bowls, chopsticks, towels and toothbrush tooth powder is all our home. Blowing up and running, simple vegetables and rice, eat everywhere. Time schedule, it is not to learn to discuss documents, or to sing revolutionary songs to write wall papers, etc. The rhythm is tight and warm. The actual responsible persons are Mao Yuyi and Yuan Ming. Mao rarely sees, Yuan (later working at the Propaganda Department of the Anqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China). Organize us to learn 'Bring the Revolution to the End' and 'New Life Perspectives' (mainly labor to create the world). Just two weeks before and after. The school is over on March 1. Due to support (support), front (line), work needs, students support Daigun Doe before all inputs. \\nDing Guangyi and I were assigned to the former headquarters secretariat of the West WANWII Division to serve as instruments. Primarily transcribe the orders of the grains and grains solicitation tasks. Whether day and night, the task came to dry, dry and then rest. The two of us are Anqing high school students, and they are Zongyang, and they become good comrades. Participation in the revolution for the first time was enthusiastic. Evening walk to the Shahe River, listen to the army loud, see Baiyun Shu roll, wide sky, very happy. Allowance (at that time, the liberated area cadre and fighters implemented a supply system, food and clothing were distributed uniformly, and a small amount of allowance was issued for the purchase of soap toothbrush). Each person was four cents a month, and we bought one piece of soap and a pack of peanuts and used it out. Sitting by the river after eating peanuts, ha ha ha ha laughing, the revolutionary team should work hard, do not work for self-interest, contribute everything to the cause of liberation of the people, even sacrificing their lives. Reverence to the revolutionaries was born. To feel that the path we have chosen to participate in the revolution is truly right. \\nIn late March, large PLA troops began to go south on the road outside Tongcheng, Anhe Road, day and night, preparing to cross the river. With green leaf branches camouflage of three people in a row of teams, mixed with seized car cannons, mighty, endless. The slogan 'Hit the Yangtze River and catch Chiang Kai-shek' and the song of 'Three Discipline Eight Attention', and the hills are swinging. KMT airplanes fly over or even machine-gun fire, but the large forces are still well organized and kept moving forward! \\nIn mid-April, I was instructed to inspect grains and grains at some of the stations. We arrived at the grass and the palace. No. 23 went to Zongyang (Jiliberation). From Zongyang there are 20 miles from the Guan Bridge, heard the front gun rumble. Near Zongyang, artillery sound stopped. Soon after going to Zongyang, it was heard that the army had been dujiang from Teppanzhou and other places, to Guichi Wusha Gate The next morning, the army had moved 90 miles to Yin Jia Hui. Anqing, Jiujiang, Wuhu, Nanjing have liberated. The Qianli River defense built by the Kuomintang does not actually collapse without war. \\nAfter returning to Tongcheng, I was reassigned to the second special office (in Tongcheng), to work on arts and education. With secretary Zhu (I am old, his name can't be remembered), went to the Education Department of Hefei North Bank of Anhui Province for a meeting. He took me by car from Anqing and Wuhu to Nanjing Zhonghua Gate. In order to see the liberated Nanjing, we went night, via Xinjiekou, Drum Tower. To the Shimonoshi guesthouse, everything is so fresh and excitement, no sense of tiredness. Then take the train through Bengbu around a large circle before going to Hefei. The conference was attended by the teaching and education cadres of various special departments. He mainly studied the report of Director Dai on the Party's Education Policy-'Education for Workers and Farmers'. I heard most of it for the first time. Learn very seriously, and remember the notes very carefully. After returning to Tongcheng, the spirit of the meeting was also conveyed to primary and secondary school teachers. Soon the office moved to Anqing and changed its name to Anqing Special Office. After Anqing city also came in. I mainly manage primary education in Anqing City. \\nIn the winter of 1949, the winter school was run in rural areas, I went to Taihu Lake's Anhui Hubei junction to examine winter school. This is the depths of Dabie Mountain, mountain high forest dense, beast, creek cross, "},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "groove deep slope steep. There are few fields, and the farmhouses live in the middle of the mountain. Every night, the farmers were three or five hordes, lit the torches to come to winter school. The high class consciousness, political enthusiasm and desire for knowledge of the liberated peasants are really moving. In winter school, while teaching peasants to literacy, explain the Party's policy, enlighten farmers in grievances, and lay the foundation for anti-domination of land reform in the future. Later, I wrote a newsletter and reported in the Anqing Daily. \\nMay be the winter of 1949 or the spring of 1950, Anqing Catholic chongwen primary school, the Spanish-born Father Mo sodomy elementary school. Zhang Chengjun asked me to investigate in depth and found that more than one person. They used small grace, such as food change, and so on, to deceive elementary school students into the room to do this unbearable hook. Students and parents (usually religious), victims before liberation dared to speak (and some had gained the benefit of the church). And now they all come up to expose and criticize these beast in religious cloak. The expulsion shall be decided by a court decision upon verification of the situation. Although there is no severe punishment, it also grows up the ambition of the Chinese people. It was later known that this was part of the three-self-revolutionary movement of religion, to cut off imperialists who used religion to bully the Chinese people to interfere in China's misery. \\nIn the summer of 1950, I moved to a training course for unemployed intellectuals. Subsequently, the training course was changed to Anqing Teachers. I was the first team leader of the training class and secretary of the school's youth group (I was recommended by the party organization when the Mission was founded in 1950). The training course was tasked with educating unemployed intellectuals on a revolutionary life perspective, examining their experiences and then assigning appropriate jobs (mainly as primary and secondary school teachers), according to their abilities and performance. Those who have serious historical problems, as long as they are clear and willing to repent, are also allocated on the basis of the principle of frankness and leniency. Only those who resist individual circumstances are not assigned, even by the political and legal authorities. \\nAt the beginning of the Korean War, China did not participate, but the United States sent its seventh fleet to the Taiwan Strait, obstructing our country's liberation of Taiwan and bombing northeastern China. (Editor's note: bullying propaganda.), causing great indignation among the Chinese people. When the war burned to China's border and the volunteer army entered the DPRK war, 'anti-US assistance to defend the country' became the common wish of our enthusiastic young people, and all have signed up for the volunteer army. The leadership left me behind because of job needs. But I am very proud that volunteers have defeated the enemy armed to the teeth with the inferior equipment of the Xiaomi Rifle, stabilize the front near the 38th line, win respect and valuable peacebuilding environment for the young republic, and have changed the humiliating history of more than 100 years. (Editor's note: propaganda bullying.), Today, I know that the Korean War was provoked and launched by Kim Il Sung, but in any case, the United States should not, in any case, engage in brutal and unjustified interference, intimidation and obstruct the liberation of Taiwan against China, which was not involved in the war. \\nI was actively involved in the 1952 Third Anti-Five Anti-Five Anti-Five Anti-Five Movement. Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan case made me highly educated. Compared with the corruption of the Kuomintang, feeling the glory and rightness of the Communist Party is to serve the people wholeheartedly. In the course of his role as the team captain of the school's tiger (who was determined to be more than 1,000 yuan greedy at that time is the Tiger), the chief general affairs officer in charge of capital construction, check the invoice one by one by one, check the bribe and rebate amount, check the bribe and rebate amount, and work hard. Zhang finally pleaded guilty in the face of a large amount of evidence, admitting and confessing most of the corruption. Later in Anhui Province (at this time the second line of Anhui Province, Anhui Province), summer middle school teacher classes, he was treated as a model of leniency. Through the test of movement, I took the oath to join the Communist Party of China on September 18, 1952 at the end of the course. \\nCalmly and quietly said that the three anti-five anti-five anti-five anti-five opposition movement has achieved great success. It has enabled all party members to receive a profound clear-cut education, and in the future for a considerable period of time (just before the Cultural Revolution, long before the reform and opening up), generally maintained the Party's calm atmosphere. (Editor's note: propaganda bullying.), But the campaign is not a good method. First, he is prone to wrong good people, and secondly, the quarantine censorship and certain brutal acts in the campaign are essentially illegal detention and violation of civil rights. (Labor interrogation is common). The most important thing is that the campaign can only work for a moment, and it cannot prevent corruption in the long term. A well-thought-out and effective anti-corruption advocacy system is essential if the problem is to be addressed at the root of the problem. Such as disclosure system for official property declaration, strict and effective monitoring and auditing system, exit review system, etc. The root cause of many of our subsequent scourges and mistakes lies in the absence of serious research into the formulation and implementation of a sound legal system governing the state of the State in the early years of the founding of the nation, but in a rush campaign with leadership dancing. 'Immediately get the world Anneng immediately cure?' This is not as much as ancient as some feudal open empire! \\nWith the basic end of the job assignment for unemployed intellectuals, Anqing teachers gradually shifted to formal teacher education, and I also gradually turned to the work of the Political Teaching and Teaching Mission. Although I tried to learn some of the classic Marxist-Leninist writings, I felt that I was not able to learn enough and needed further education. In spring 1952, notice of dry study was issued. I made a request to the organization for further studies. At that time, at a time when the Three Counters' Movement was in full swing, I was a tiger captain. The leader said that he would be released from work immediately to participate in the study, but I agreed to attend the college entrance examination in summer. I had to review my homework while working. Summer training course, in Wuhu to attend the college entrance examination, was taken by the Department of Physics of Peking University. \\nPeking University is the school I aspire to, and the Department of Physics is the place where I become a nuclear physicist and realize my dream of saving the nation of science. The leadership still seemed to want me to stay, and I showed my wish and got organizational agreement. In early December 1952, I finally became a new student at Peking University and started my university life. \\nFive years of Peking University\\nWhen I first crossed into the gate of Peking University, walking through two huabiao and palace-like office buildings, walking on the shores of the beautiful Unnamed Lake, the ice of the lake was mirrored and reflected in the shadow of the unknown tower. The wickering willow on the shore has been removed from the green leaves, but the fine shoots still blow in the breeze, covering the red wall of green tile by the lake. A beautiful stone boat at the heart of the lake pavilion in the distance. The stone bridge is a rainbow, reclining the white stone railings on the bridge and admire beautiful lake views. I was jawned and stunned. This heavenly palace que, the wonderland of earth, I will learn here. Therefore, secretly determined, we must strive to learn well, cast yourself into a useful material, and better serve the country in the future, only to be able to afford the training of the Party and the people, and not to be guilty of their own life. \\nAt Peking University, while studying hard, I worked as general secretary of the Mission (at that time the university did not have a political counselor). After the adjustment of the faculty, teaching first-line masters gathered, such as Huang Kun teach general physics, concise and enlightening, Wang Zhuxi teaches thermodynamics and statistical physics, deep, education of electrodynamics Juning and Zhou Guangzhao, are also masters of the first time haojun. I am not the best in class, but Yemen has excellent results. Named Miyoshi. Work learning is busy and fulfilling. \\nLater, for the purpose of nation-building, the party put forward the slogan to march towards science. It caused a high level of enthusiasm among physics students. At the school conference, I called for efforts to train young people to become scientists in the construction needs of the motherland. The same classmates of the same grade pointed out 'What kind of people will we be?' This reference was later criticized by school leaders, saying that 'young people should not pursue the bourgeois fame, and should not learn from bourgeois scientists. The Party's educational policy is to train people who need to build talents'. This gives us an education in the perspective of life of 'Unsung Heroes, Screws of Revolution'. In the aftermath of the harsh political climate, the references made by Fang Li and others would be criticized as a serious matter of thought. But the issue of youth thought was relatively liberal. Criticism, education, did not go deeper. \\nIn the spring and summer of 1955, students criticized some reactionary ideological statements (including, of course, screening of individual students suspected of counter-revolution). At first, I was a member of the leading group of students, meeting every day and I was busy. Soon, criticism of Hu Feng was launched, and a letter from the Hu Feng Group published in the People's Daily included a × × × (perhaps Zhang Zhongxiao, which was unclear), to cousin Ni Ziming, a clandestine member of the Communist Party of China during the anti-Japanese period, working at the Ministry of Culture. Childhood knows, after a long time without contact. After going to Peking University, I also visit his house only once a year on summer vacation). I immediately reported this to the organization, and my political review began immediately. The general secretary of the regiment did not do, and the work of the anti-opposition group changed others, but some critical congresses still asked me to chair or participate, probably a study. I certainly have a sense of sentiment, although I believe that the organization can finally figure out the problem. \\nAt this time, some students were selected from my class to check physics. Certainly without me. For a long time, volunteerism could not be achieved, and the heart was very annoyed. The censorship will certainly cover all aspects of family social relations, which has led me to mishandling my personal life, hurting a girlfriend who has been in love for many years (she took part in the revolution as a teenager, but family relationships are complex and 'poorly handled'). They are also depressed. In short, my emotions were relatively low during this time. \\nIt should be said that organizational censorship to me still speaks of policy, not public among the masses. No big damage to me, continues to be rated as Miyoshi. I am also grateful to the organization for that. In the autumn of 1955, I stayed in the fourth year to study Russian in order to prepare for professional translation work by future Soviet experts. Later, the review of me also ended. \\nIn 1956, I returned to Nanjing to visit my family. That year's Spring Festival in Nanjing was cold, there was no air conditioning, plus some time ago my mood was rather depressed, poor physical resistance. After returning to Beijing hemoptysis, pulmonary tuberculosis, residential hospital. I am only translating the speeches of Soviet experts. Xu Mengxia is responsible for interpreting classes, and his speaking skills are better than me. The expert is an associate PhD who studied vibration theory, with the title equivalent of a later associate professor in our country, and returned home for a semester of the course on vibration. I changed to a teaching assistant. \\nAt the turn of spring and summer this year \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), the winds movement began. Chairman Mao called on everyone to express their opinions and help the Party to rectify. Initially, some intellectuals published articles in newspapers, such as Fei Xiaotong's 'Early Spring Weather for Intellectuals', and then the big print newspaper of North University students was posted. Shop all over the world, with a variety of words. This, of course, has the context of its times and the international situation. When Stalin died in 1953, the students of Peking University were immersed in grief. At the memorial meeting held at Level V II of our Department of Physics, we wept away. But then there were some secret Khrushchev reports that people were dismayed and could not believe it was the New York Times rumor. The classmates did not see the report. But Rusuu students came out of the Soviet youth dissatisfaction with Stalin, vaguely seemed to be real. Soon, Poland and Hungary broke out successively, prompting young students to reflect on some of our post-liberation problems and ways of dealing with them, and even large print newspapers put forward such serious political problems as 'Hu Feng is not a counter-revolution'. But most classmates are mostly dissatisfied with job distribution and the stiffness of thought work. At that time, I was opposed to sticking the big print, opposed to the counter-revolutionary case for Hu Feng, and even less in favor of Lin Xiling to incite the fire to Peking University. I thought that it was for fear that the world was not messy, the Party would not But I think that some of the students' opinions about our work style are worth referring to improvement. It should not be used in the big print, whether it is possible to use the practice of intra-party opinions, that might be easier to adopt. So he wrote three opinions (or outline), on a piece of paper, and prepared to book it to the Party Central Committee after considering maturity. \\nIts main content is to hope that the party should be an enlightened parent, and do not overlook too fine. Job assignment can take more into account individual volunteering. In the field of natural science research, scientists should be allowed to explore practice, not to prejudge conclusions and avoid the mistakes of the Soviet Union's one-sided support of the Lee Sen Scientists against Morgan's genetics doctrine (the latter proved more correct); secondly, to oppose bureaucracy to improve the Party's style, there is a need to strengthen the understanding of all levels Supervision of cadres. Given that leaders are usually afraid or unwilling to supervise leadership, advocate that the supervision, the judiciary should not be led by a party committee at the same level and have relative independence; third, considering the selfish side of humanity (the spontaneous tendency of farmers, workers' unionist tendencies), the Soviet Union had to depart from the early days of the revolution. Retreat and implement a new economic policy. I felt that the communist principle of 'every effort needed' (as translated at that time), could be infinitely approached, like absolute zero in thermodynamics, but it would be difficult to fully achieve, taking into account the socialist principle of 'each best possible value' in practice. \\nLater, I discussed the above ideas with my better classmates, comrade Li Shuxian and Fang Lizhi, and they also agreed. A conference report was made to the branch immediately. But still hesitate unresolved. Soon, June 6, 'People's Daily' editorial 'Why Is This?' Published, blown the anti-right horn. The submission will not dare to move the pen. At the end of the anti-right period, the organization asked me, I made a truthful account and submitted the above outline. On this basis, it was determined that the leadership of my opposition party, systematic revisionist ideology, was fought to the extreme right, was expelled from party membership, dismissed from office, and punished by supervision of labor. Inspired, Li Shuhan was also classified as a right-wing dismissal from the party, but the handling was lighter and remained in school. Although not classified as the right, the party who worked in the Academy of Sciences was expelled from the party. I feel very guilty and uneasy for them to be implicated by my negligence. \\nIn March 1958, I left Peking University in anticipation of sin to work at the Beijing Knitting Factory. \\nVI. Tough times\\nAt this time, I deeply repented myself, believing that I personally considered too much, could not stand the test of political scrutiny, failed the Party's training and trust, embarked on the anti-socialist road of anti-party anti-socialism, and determined to work hard to transform, get back to life and return to the ranks of the Party and the people in the future. Thoughts deeply dig the root of mistakes, also actively work in labor, to lead our old worker Xin to learn. At the time I worked in the drying room of the knitting factory bleaching workshop, manual operation, difficult conditions. Summer in the drying room at high temperature, climb to dry wet cloth, I'm not afraid of hot, sweat as rain. Winter is 1958 great leap forward, yield, heavy task, drying room is not enough, on the open high wooden rack cloth. Beijing's winter, very cold, wet velvet cloths dry soon, it freezes. It is a cold war, heat, high heat, energy. I wrote an oil poem at the time (everyone should write poetry and sing revolutionary spirit at the Great Leap Forward): 'The cold and cold nights, hang out. Heart warm body warmth, hero laughing north wind!' Once, in the summer, I was shaded by the sun on the elevation. Luckily did not fall down, wake up and then dry. In this way, I inspect my thoughts in depth, while seriously working and receiving the education of the working class, which is also recognized by the factory party organization. \\nIn September 1959, Beijing Textile Industry Bureau established amateur textile college (later renamed amateur textile engineering college), transferred me to the school to teach, general physics and higher mathematics teaching tasks. Later, I came to a mathematics teacher from the Geology School, and I specialize in general physics. Students are the technical backbone of JD textile factories, engineers, technicians, workshop directors. Typically secondary school level. \\nIn June 1960, I took off the right-wing hat, and the salary (I had no salary when I worked at the factory, only paid 18 yuan per month), $62 per month (at that time, the salary standard of Beijing university graduates was two levels lower than my original salary). Give me another step in a few years. \\n1961 summer return to Nanjing to get married. My wife Cheng Yuhui met when I returned to Nanjing in 1956. It was just a friend at the time. When she knew I made mistakes, she did not ignore me, but encouraged me to work hard to transform. I was moved and gradually loved one another. When married, Huamei lent me 100 yuan, plus the salary saved more than 100 yuan, August 1, we went to Hangzhou to get married. Nothing to buy, and no money to buy. My wife is a good teacher at the second level of primary school. Her salary is higher than me. Her family is supported by her. \\nIn the years of amateur spinning, I worked hard and diligently researched my business, and went to the Beijing Library on Sunday to see the magazine. 'To attack physical steal the morning evening, to report the people to deport'. Without conditions to do experiments, then engage in theoretical physics. Several papers were written and sent to the Journal of Physics, all returned, without even a decent reason to do so. Later I knew that the manuscripts of the right (the right still right), would not be used by newspapers and magazines. 'A shoulders of wind and rain, drop Jinghua for more than ten years', I sigh myself too ignorant. In order to take care of the relationship, we decided to apply for transfer back to Nanjing. \\nIn September 1965, returned to Nanfu, teaching at Nanjing Technical School. The school is a secluded environment in the mountains near the suburbs of Nanjing. At the beginning I went to the Nanjing Library several times. The museum's foreign language magazines are incomplete and there is a shortage of information. Coupled with busy household chores (with two children), the workplace is far away from home, it takes a long day on the road, and later on the brittle, no more physical research. \\nIn 1966, the storm of the Cultural Revolution came. Because I usually teach carefully and patiently assist poor students, students have little opinion about me. The school leaders also did not throw files. In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, student bucket teachers, smashing and grabbing the wind waves, there is always no risk, safe to spend. Later, a teacher threw my material. Fortunately, the students were busy in tandem at that time, and they could not afford to fight the teacher. But my wife and my heart have been trembling and trembling and trembling, as if they would be in disaster. One day, the students stole my bike, could not find the car, went home late, wife holding two children waiting anxiously at the alley. That situation is still a history of purpose and cannot be forgotten. Throughout the Cultural Revolution process, my wife did not have a complaint to me, always silently cared about me to support me. Spend the years of disaster together. \\nIn 1968 when I cleaned up the class, I was criticized by the struggle, but they were old problems of the past. Soon, the technical school was closed and converted to a machine tool repair plant (actually producing lathes). I put it down to the warehouse as a steel downloader, and then transferred to the workshop to do the handling workpiece runner. The attitude of the workers towards me is still relatively good and never falsified. I don't move the workpiece, they just help me to move, or find energetic runners to move. So I've been doing it for seven years. After Deng Xiaoping comeback, catch production. In 75 years, the machine tool repair plant was changed to a high speed gearbox factory. Imported a lot of equipment, a large number of English technical materials and equipment specifications need to be translated, and I went to the Technical Section for translation. I was 45 years old. \\nMistakes have been made almost 20 years. In the early days determined to transform myself, I was also very energetic when the big leap forward. When the big steel is made, the earth is on the horizon, and some workers secretly say they did not make steel. I also doubt whether it can make steel, but still praise the masses for their revolutionary dynamism. In 1959 agriculture put satellites, mu produce more than 10,000 pounds, tens of thousands of pounds, I do not doubt. Later it came out of 130,000 pounds, I can't believe it, good guy! Is it possible to have 65 tons of rice even if it's flat in more than 660 square meters of fields? Before the car's knowledge, I do not dare voice. Later, work in the countryside to help vegetable farmers harvest carrots, the grass in the ground is much higher than carrots. Several peasant women led us to work, and their carrots pulled out were not paid to the public, poured at home, and explained that the canteen was not enough to eat. I slowly know in my heart that one big two public, sweeping the Communist wind, agriculture has gone wrong. Later, a 'three-year disaster' (actually not a natural disaster), appeared, supply shortages, puffiness prevailed, and people in rural areas were starving to death, and now there are data that more than 30 million people have died of starvation across the country. What a policy failure is that. I was right to refer to 'the principle of communism that is necessary for each and every effort to do everything possible' is right when I feel against the right. The leadership made such a big mistake. Peng Dewiti turned into an opposition party. Some people mentioned at the 7,000 people assembly that in the Cultural Revolution were defeated. There is no strict supervision over leadership, no effective checks and balances on power, okay? My comments at the time on strengthening oversight were not wrong. What is bad at work to respect the opinions of the masses, and less force orders, to be a leader supported by enlightened and enlightened masses? \\nThat's what I thought went through a negative negative shift, but there was no dare to say anything at that time. \\nAfter the Third Plenary Session, the four people helped fall, began to raise a peaceful case against wrongs and mistakes in reform and opening-up. Peking University Nanjing student Cheng Li knew my whereabouts from her cousin (secretary of her wife's primary school), and came to tell me about the spirit of the central government to correct the right-wing issue, and gave me great excitement. I decided to file a complaint to the Peking University Party Committee: 'In 1957, I was prepared to raise opinions to the higher party is consistent with the party's constitution. It is a party member's legal right, cannot be opposed to the opposition, and only to mention it, the opinion is not written; the two opinions themselves are not mistaken in principle.' \\nI went to Beijing in March 1979 and found the Peking University Party Committee, and they agreed to my complaint. In just two or three days, I corrected my past right-wing problem, restoring party membership and original salary levels, and reissuing the graduation certificate. Later, the problems of Li Shuhan and Fang Lizhi were also resolved. After returning to the factory, because I work seriously and responsibly. There is no mistake in translating a large amount of material. According to the translated information, all imported equipment debugging operation and maintenance, have obtained satisfactory results and was rated as a model party member. \\nSince the second half of 1978, many students such as Hou Depeng (later President of Guangxi University and Minister of Propaganda of Guangxi Provincial Committee), and Wang Kelin (Professor of HKUST), have been working hard for my work. In the winter of 1978, Guangxi University came to business letter, Yuhui said Nanning too far, did not go. The following spring, Hefei China Science and Technology University also came to business. I decided to go to HKUST, but the Nanjing Municipal Personnel Bureau did not let it go to Nanjing, and asked me to stay for work in Nanjing. I proposed to go to Nanda and get agreed. In autumn 1979, I was transferred to the Institute of Acoustics, Department of Physics, NANU. It's 49 years of age almost 50, 22 years from 1957. The most precious, energetic and most critical years of life have disappeared. \\nSeven is quite old\\nDuring the period of NANDAC, in addition to teaching general physics and modern physics, the main teachers were from Mr. Wei Rongjue, from cryogenic acoustics, supercurrent, nonlinear acoustics, solitary waves, and chaos (including the study of chaotic bifurcation behavior of loudspeakers in cooperation with Tao Dyne, Tong Pei Qing, etc.), I'm not good at acoustic experiments. He also received guidance and assistance from Academician Hao Berlin in the research of chaos. \\nA fast 'fifty and known destiny' person, politicians, such as power, may still have something to do, but for the long term and scientific frontier isolation, from scratch, from scratch, from the very competitive physical research that has progressed a day, such an age is quite old! Despite my hard work and study, I have been an instructor, associate professor, etc., I also published more than 40 papers in academic journals at home and abroad, published a scientific book (Ni wansun, Wei Rongjue, Shanghai Science and Technology Education Press in 1997), and worked with people twice Science and Technology Progress Award (1985, Second Prize for Science and Technology Progress of the State Education Commission and 1990 Step first prize), to achieve some results. But in general, it was done under the pressure of promoting the title, and not much laudable pioneering work that could be passed on. He also brought two PhD students, but all hung under someone else's name, marry people. I regret that. \\nDuring this period, I went to Italy, Japan and Hong Kong for academic activities. In 1986, Professor Ali, University of Toronto, Canada, invited me to do a post doctoral. At that time, three daughters were in college and high school, and the family had a heavy burden, and I could not put that burden on my wife. And the sense of self-perception is older, it also declined. \\nIn the early 1980s, the ideology of reform and opening up was more active. There are both reflections on the past and forward-looking thinking. I am in favour of the reform of the political system. But it advocates progressive progress under the leadership of the Party. It was not in favor of some people who had challenged the bottom line of the party and blindly restless. I think that if the Kang Liang change can succeed, it would be better than warlords melee after the Xinhai Revolution. The constitutional compromise caused by the British Magna Carta movement is better than the chaos of the French Revolution for more than 80 years and the suffering of the people. In a sense, my view is similar to the constitutional idea of a 'party constitution' within the system that was later proposed. The leadership of the opposition parties, the reckless democratic proposition, is actually about regime change. Great stakes are bound to give rise to fierce opposition. Social unrest, stagnation of production, suffering from people and even the division of the country are inevitable. The subsequent break-up of the Soviet Union and the upheaval in Eastern Europe was another example, where the old leaders had ceased power, and the new ones in power were struggling for power, causing the country to disintegrate and suffer people"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": " in regressive production. And under the leadership of the Party gradually carry out the socialist democratic reform. (Since the Party is a great duke who wholeheartedly serves the people's interests and wholeheartedly represents the interests of the broadest people, recognizing that 'the people can carry a boat or get a boat', the necessary and appropriate political reform should be gradually carried out in response to the public opinion, and the masses also need to have Enough sanity calm and patience, to strive for persuasions, to achieve a reasonable compromise), there will be no such catastrophe Sexual situation. When I traveled to Beijing in 1987 (or 1988), I talked about my views with Fang Lizhi, when he was expelled again from the party, emotionally excited and unfriendly. His wife, Lee Shu-han, proposed to take pictures. None of them were taken. We do not rejoice. I didn't agree with the students when 'six.' The result was in my misfortune. led to a violent reversal, and the two leaders stepped down successively. Of course, there may also be debatable ways in which young students involved in the 'turmoil' were handled at that time. \\nIn a blink of 11 years, 90 years of leave. A study on chaotic and confidential communications (the National Defence Science and Technology Commission project), was conducted after the separation. Later Yuhui's disease became more and more severe, and I was completely old. \\nI and Yuhui have three daughters. Ni Yan (1964-), graduated from Peking University with a master's degree from Xiamen University and Columbia University. Ni Yin (1965-), graduated from the Department of Information Physics, Nanjing University, MBA, CUNY. Young girl Cheng Yi (1972-), Nanjing University junior class transferred to the Department of Foreign Languages, received a full scholarship from Monte Holly College to study in the United States, and then received a master's degree in economics from Duke University. They all stand alone. I don't need me to worry about them anymore. \\nVIII. Tomorrow will be more Yu\\n'One hundred generations of light Yin pass', a turn of eyes, I have been the year. Reading 'Sima Relocation to Shao Ching's Book' when he was young, was impressed by his words of 'Li Tak Li'. But now only to be worthy of it. If my body time allows, maybe I'll look at books, do something to learn, spend the rest of my life. Old, no gain or loss, do a little bit, mental sustenance, can be less Alzheimer's disease, not tasted is not a way to keep up. \\n'Childhood country broke tears, hard work when he was strong' because I always wanted to recall the past. But a lot of people who care about me want me to write, children also want to know some old ones. I decided I still wrote this memory. But in the past let it go, like smoke like a dream. Still should look forward. \\nComrade Xiaoping's reform and opening-up led China to the road to rich and strong construction. The new leaders elected at the 18th Congress insisted on reform and opening-up, re-embarked on Deng Xiaoping's road to south tour, a fresh winds of people, and the wind of anti-corruption advocacy fluttered. I believe that under the leadership of General Secretary Xi Jinping, the future of the motherland will be better, despite difficulties, obstacles and twists in one or another! Will definitely be better! \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 3"}

The original Wuyi Qingyuan tea cake is cheap and beautiful, than Quanzhou another famous brand product, the price is only one seventh of it. After switching to Daffodil tea, cost reduction is conducive to expanding production, products are exported to the province and abroad, and in Southeast Asia to open new sales points, such as Liao Meifang in the Philippines, New Mirror Shop in Cebu, Singapore Xu Liancheng and Zhuang Zhenniang in Surabaya, etc. During the war of resistance against Japan, especially when Japanese imperialist aggression against Southeast Asian countries, transportation in the Pacific Ocean was cut off, remittances stalled, and overseas Chinese and hometown selling Nanyang's special products were in trouble and could hardly survive, while Wuyi Qingyuan tea cake was worry-free and still stand, because it also had a vast market in the country. After the victory of the anti-Japanese war, remittances were restored, overseas Chinese cycled home, Hongji tea Zhuang business is booming, become a large industrial and commercial household in Quanzhou. The solemn cause has been successful, honourable and generous, willing to work for public welfare and to help those seeking help. \\nServing the business community\\nAs early as his student age, Ni was solemnly influenced by the progressive thinking. After entering society, I felt more deeply the political corruption of the old society, the weak and poor, and the brutal aggression against Japan's imperialism, had a strong patriotic salvation heart. On the eve of liberation, he also received propaganda and education from the underground party members of the CCP. Society must change, and the revolution of the Communist Party of China complies with the hearts of the people. Therefore, he warmly welcomed and supported the liberation of Quanzhou and actively participated in political and social activities. In 1950, he was elected as the first people's representative of Jinjiang County (Quanzhou to 1951 initially established city, formerly Jinjiang County). In May of the same year, the County People's Congress decided to set up a 'Business Research Association', whose task is: to publicize the Party's guidelines and policies in the business community, consult and study to solve major problems in the business community, and prepare for the establishment of the 'Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Commerce' to take over the former Jinjiang County Chamber of Commerce, better for the matter of new democracy Industry services. 34 people's representatives of industry and commerce in the county, and 21 more, as members of the Business Research Association, Ni Zheng acted as the chairman. He unite all members of the Association, reaching out to large, medium and small businesses, working hard to accomplish various tasks. In just three months, the Preparatory Committee for Industry and Commerce was established in August of the same year. Cai Zai-Jing served as the chairman, Ni zhengzhong and Liu Shuhou were deputy chairman members. After the official establishment of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the first and second Ni Ren Vice Chairman. The Preparatory Committee of the Quanzhou Municipal Committee of the China National Democratic National Assembly was established, Ni Ren deputy chairman member. In 1957, Ni Yin was mistaken as the right, withdrew the post of deputy chairman of the Civil Construction, Industry and Commerce Federation, and implemented the policy reinstatement after the 'Cultural Revolution'. In 1985, Ni was elected to Quanzhou civil construction five, seven chairmen of the Federation of Commerce and Industry, Quanzhou civil construction six and seven honorary chairpersons, the Honorary President of Quanzhou Chamber of Commerce, until the death of illness. \\nIn the 50s, the task of the Federation of Commerce and Industry is very heavy, everything has to do fine work. For example, to rectify grass-roots organizations-dozens of trade associations, ideological and political education and learning of party policies, promote production, flourish the local economy, help solve business problems, labor relations problems, help tax work, develop accountants to help build books and so on. The central tasks laid down by their superiors are one after another. Political movements solemnly participate in collective leadership or division of labour, often day and night. The completion of every task in Quanzhou business and industry is inseparable from his efforts. \\nAt the end of 1950, Ni was named an activist in anti-US aid donation. After the 'Five Counters' campaign in 1952, private enterprises encountered difficulties. The Party and the People's Government called for material exchange, active urban-rural economy, Ni He Federation of Industry and Commerce cadres actively assisted in organizing local products exhibition meetings, and actively participated in 17 material exchange meetings in provinces, lands and counties, and also led by Ni led a visiting delegation to Shanghai and material exchange. The delegation's visit and exchange in Shanghai played a major role in solving the difficulties of private enterprises and the prosperity of the local economy. During the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, Ni took the lead to handing over Hongji Tea Zhuang and houses together with Wuyi Qingyuan tea cake preparation recipe and law, unreservedly to the leaders of the private restructuring sent by the Party and the Government. \\nIn 1957, Ni was mistaken as a right-wing, and seriously hit in the Cultural Revolution, but he did not shake his belief in advocating the Chinese Communist Party and taking the path of socialism. \\nPromote the development of oolong tea industry\\nIn 1960, Ni voluntarily requested to devolve work on the Qingyuan farm, and then to remain on the farm as a technician until he retired for 18 years in order to have her daughter supplement. On the farm he has been working with the workers, not afraid of dirty, not afraid of hardship, to work for grievances. Management of tea forest, often waving hoe digging, weeding, sweating; tea making process, always rotating with the youth, sleepless, without a little expert scholar and cadre shelf, others do not see that he was a large business and businessman. The cadres and employees of the farm are very respectful of him, seeing that he is older, his body is weak, repeatedly advised attention to rest, just give technical guidance and do not have to take part in manual labor, and he always laughs out, saying, 'Even if my body is not working, I will pick up stones.' He not only actively participates in manual labor, but also uses his rich knowledge and practical experience, personally managing and guiding the breeding of tea, carrying out various process reforms, fruitful. \\nIn 1980, the farm carried out a loss increase and profit activities, solemnly once again offered the recipe and method of making tea cakes, proposed the farm to set up 'Qingyuan tea cake factory', by He Rong as factory director. As a result, hundreds of thousands of yuan in tax on farm profits for two years, contributing to the farm's losses and profits. In the future, small tea bricks were created, trade exchanges with the Xinjiang Autonomous Region were developed, exchanged or not, and opened up channels for the farm to generate money, and some slow-sold local products in Xinjiang were also exported to Quanzhou region, benefiting each other. \\nSolemnly pay attention to the training of talents, hope the farm has a lot of tea technology personnel. He speaks about tea science to the staff at any time and patiently answers their questions. He Rong, the deputy chairman of the Quanzhou Municipal Committee of Minjian, also worked on Qingyuan Farm at that time. Ni encouraged him to drill into tea science, he saw that he had an active role and had chemical expertise. So why dispel the idea of leaving the farm, dive to learn, self-learning. Later, Ni also invited him to participate in tea research activities in the province and abroad, and to discover and examine the history of tea, he is often invited to study together. Therefore, a part of Ni's tea paper was written in cooperation with Ho. 'My son is not interested in tea research, I think of you as a nephew, and in the future I will send all the research materials to you,' Ni said while encouraging him to study tea technology. He is also very concerned about his life and work. That makes why very grateful and brave to move forward. \\nOolong tea has a natural fruity fragrance, mellow taste, color yellow, is one of the treasures of our country's culture, as early as the 17th century has been popular in Europe, 'Western bloom to buy, Wang Qian regardless of official teeth' (17th century Nguyen Minxi's 'Anxi tea song', said that the Chinese people buy tea in the years, afraid they can not buy tea, not (Dare to bargain). In modern times, some countries in the world have also set off 'oolong tea fever', especially in Japan. Oolong tea has the role of summer, heat reduction, cooling, digestive oil, reminding the brain, scientific research believes that it has the function of 'weight loss, beauty, antihypertensive, anti-cancer, prevention of atomic radiation'. Ni has deep feelings for oolong tea, and has a spirit of reform and innovation. He praised the ancient working people who created the oolong tea process. In 1955, he organized tea technicians to experiment and exchange at Yongchun farm to summarize the tea process of Fujian narcissus varieties (narcissus and Tieguanyin are two beads of oolong tea). But he always felt that traditional tea was made by hand, making it difficult to produce and compete internationally, and he was always attentive to finding ways of reform. \\nAfter going to Qingyuan Tea Farm, he studied and reformed the techniques of tea pruning, picking, manufacturing process and white coal roasted tea. 1964 Participated in the design of white coal tea tools successfully, and promoted in Quanzhou, Anxi, so that fuel is not difficult and reduces costs. In 1975, he participated in the development of 'oolong tea bag kneading machine', replacing 'with cloth bag and hand kneading' process with a machine. Oolong tea production to mechanized, semi-mechanized development, is what Ni seeks. In the past, he used oolong tea 'shaping machine' trial production, not ideal, so he was very positive on the development of 'kneading machine'. However, trial production after manufacturing is still not ideal, not comparable to the quality of manual production. In this case, Ni considering the world's tea countries, drinking red tea has become habit for a long time, because foreigners think crushed tea may soon leach all the juice, and striped tea must be brewed two or three times to make the best use; and tea is heavier, tea-shaped secondly, and the appearance of oolong tea is not beautiful. Therefore, he proposed to reform the tea making process to produce crushed oolong tea. This is available in ready-made machines. In September 1977, with the support of Fujian Provincial Bureau of Agriculture (Department), Fujian Province Local Products Import and Export Company and Yuxi District Chinese Tea Company and Foreign Trade Bureau, in collaboration with Yunxiao County overseas Chinese and peaceful farm tea factory, conducted three trial experiments, a total of 7 batches of broken oolong tea samples, reviewed by a number of technicians, and hand We made a comparison, think the mechanism can reveal the unique flavor of oolong tea, taste strong, basically can Maintain the quality characteristics of traditional products. The mechanism can simplify, shorten the production process, improve the refining rate, greatly improve yield and output value, save labor, reduce labor intensity. The sample also through the province foreign trade to Japan and other places cloth samples, get praise. \\nIn 1978, solemnly understand the quality of red crushed tea in China, due to some natural conditions restrictions, 'thick, strong, fresh' (international requirements), was affected by certain effects, export is not good. He considered that oolong tea has high fragrance characteristics, and has always used a variety of tea to improve the quality of the practice, suggested that through the test, in black tea in a certain proportion mixed with broken oolong tea, thus shaping the unique flavor of red tea in China, improve the international status of red tea in China. In the same year, and Sichuan Tea Research Institute collaborated, 'floral red crushed tea' was successful. \\nWritings quite apocalypse\\nThe spring breeze of reform and opening-up of the CPC Central Committee blows across the land of the motherland. In addition to his own proposals for various reforms through the organization and the mobilization of members of the Civil Construction and Commerce Federation to put forward the reform ideas widely, he also boosted the opinions of their peers in tea, and raised the issue of reforming the tea production and marketing system. He made specific recommendations on the situation and some problems of increasing the annual production of tea by 50,000 tons of tea in Fujian province since 1979, from administrative management, business management, production, side selling, domestic sales, export, taxation and Chen tea treatment. He was very anxious to deal with Chen tea backlog in the country, specially proposed to deal with Chen tea: 1, cut prices marketing; 2, pay attention to custody; 3, at home and abroad have the habit of drinking Chen tea, can be widely sold; 4, made of medicinal tea, such as tea cake, weight loss tea, pressure tea, quit tea, etc.; 5, made pressure Tea side pin and seek to sell to the USSR. Also put forward a series of proposals to improve oolong tea products, such as rational picking, improving primary quality, promoting the elimination of inferior species, changing the layout of varieties, restoring traditional camping technology to improve the quality of medium and lower grade tea. He made a series of recommendations, and at that time he had been diluted, sick, difficult to walk, and even more valuable. \\nIn the 70s, Ni also focused on the history of tea. He saw that a university textbook says 'black tea first and then oolong tea', which is quite different from what he has developed over the years from historical materials. He thinks that China created black tea and oolong tea two kinds of tea, who first and who is the issue, is an important part of the development history of tea making process, related to the growth and fall of tea in China over 100 years, for the current expansion of export, tea making modern, is not simply proof and drill horn tip. So he collected information extensively, without hard work, not afraid of difficulties. He made a special trip or use various opportunities to check the literature in various parts of the province and abroad, and reproduced more than 800,000 words of information about tea history in China and abroad. On this basis, he took a strict attitude of governance, and invited He Rong to work together to write 'Oolong tea first, black tea in the back' article, published in 'Chinese tea' in 1979, the fourth issue, from the positive argument: Wuyi Yan tea is the ancestor of oolong tea, produced in about the 17th century, The name of oolong tea was only appeared in the 1840s; the method of black tea was evolved by the oolong And that came. This paper aroused the attention of China's tea industry, leading to a useful academic contention. Next year, Ni and He Rong once again wrote 'Oolong Tea First, Black Tea in the Back' article to justify this argument with a richer and more conclusive information. The tea community generally considers these arguments to be insightful and valuable. \\nIn addition, in order to make tea management learn from, absorb useful, abandon mistakes, Ni widely collected information, combined with practical experience, studied the situation of the previous famous brand tea, wrote the 'Fujian overseas Chinese tea history', 'Minnan tea history', 'Taiwan oolong tea and Quantai trade', etc. More than 40 articles over 1.2 million words, of which more than 30 were published in tea publications and Literary and historical publications, others are sent to relevant parties for reference. In the summer of 1990, the Minjian Quanzhou City Committee set up 'Ni Zheng Zheng Tea Theory' editorial group, selected and published the book 'Ni Zheng zheng tea industry', Yongchuei his achievements in the tea industry, and let readers receive lessons. The book was compiled in 19 articles, with a total of more than 110,000 words. \\nNi was unable to work properly because of illness, but still insisted on studying the history of tea, doing the work of liaising with Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, and actively contributed to the holding of the 1990 Fujian and Taiwan Tea Symposium. \\nNi's solemn dedication is outstanding. Accumulation of business and industry, in the 50s of the private transformation to the country; the energy and time after the liberation decades were all dedicated to work, where the party arranged, he went there, well completed the task; his knowledge, all dedicated to the tea industry. His life has always been frugal, not greedy, undisputed status. In business, in academia, he is a typical one. \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】Yuan Ling: The Yu Hui of Dongwu Fatong\\nCentennial rule of law\\nThe Tokyo trial, the five constitutional drafts, the founding of the School of Comparative Law, and the reform of the Republic's judicial reform, and the spectrum of modern Anglo-American law enlightenment, legal education, constitutional exploration and national independence, added a missing dome to the temple of modern law. Projected into the current reality of the rule of law. \\nOn June 8, 2013, during a rush lunch in mentor Pan Han-dian's residence, the topic of Bai Sheng, an associate professor at the Chinese University of Political Science and Law, was as usual for most of the years: Business Printing Library intends to translate the German American scholar Bodenheimer Law while studying a graduate student at Soochow University Law School nearly 70 years ago The original book of Science reprinted, Bai Sheng recorded the manuscript electronically Document, 93-year-old Panhan Dian is undergoing intense proofreading of clear samples. \\n'I don't know how to save for so many years, today can come out.' Mrs. Panhandian said with emotion. \\nThe first time I saw the manuscript, Baisheng some dared to start. The paper page of this brush issue has been yellowed and crisp, seems to be unable to read, but the neat pen writing is clear. \\nThe old manuscript is still in place, and its birthplace-the main building of Dongwu University Law School, founded in 1915 at 146 Kunshan Road, Shanghai, after the faculties of 1952, underwent political frost and time erosion, now faded, becoming a city bustle of finance night school. Only the tall arcade and the fourth floor deep auditorium revealed the temperament of the first law school in China. \\nThere is no sign of the site on the night school, and the self-examiners who go to classes know little about the past of the building. History is like old walls have been repainted once, and all names and plots have been brushed off. \\nBut there's always something that remains like that manuscript, waiting to be rediscovered. In recent years, with the opening to the outside world and the return of constitutional rule of law, the connotation of 146 Kunshan Road has been discovered a little bit, and people gradually appreciate the irreplaceable weight of this four-story building in the century-old history of the rule of law. \\nIn just over 30 years ago in 1949, Sooh Law School trained a generation of legal elites, including a large number of prominent lawyers, seven members of the Legislative Council of the National Government, almost all Chinese legal advisers in Tokyo trials, and several judges of the International Tribunal. The reputation of 'Chaoyang (out of the judge)' has a profound impact on the rule of law in the Republic. \\nDongwu Law School has a prominent position in modern law circles, from the nomination of academicians of the first Central Research Institute in 1947: Six nominees in the legal profession, including Wang Chonghui, Guo Yunguan, Li Haopei, Wu Jingxiong, Wu Jingxiong, among whom the younger generation of Wu Jingxiong and Li Haopei are all trained by Dongwu Law School of graduates. \\nNot only that, Wu Jingxiong, Sheng Zhenwei, Yang Zhaolong, Ni zheng, Xiang Zhejun, Li Haopei, Ethan, Lu Jun, Pan Han-dian... These names that have been lost and obliviated in the empirical flow of the rule of law, together with the Tokyo trial, the five constitution and the founding of the School of Comparative Law, and judicial reform in the Republic of the Republic, and so on, were once again united and painted. From modern Anglo-law enlightenment, legal education, constitutional exploration and national self-reliance Spectroscopy, complementing the temple of modern law with a missing dome and projecting a precious afterglow into the current reality of the rule of law. \\nIn this afterglow, there is a grand festival such as the drafting of the Basic Law of Hong Kong and the performance of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, and more, as Pan Han-dian said in the 'Origin' of the Common and French Dictionary of Yuan according to 'Origin', in personal troubled encounters, 'proud bones remain, do not waste and work for the State of the State', making common law and the common law and the comparative legal blood of the common law. bleak insist. Such insistence, the law of eventually feeding the current congenital anaemia, will continue the legal inheritance that has been cut off by politics. \\nIn recent years, with the publication of Yuanzhao English-American and American Dictionary and Dongwu Xianxian Law Series for the first time, as well as the rediscovery of Yang Zhaolong, Shing Zhenwei and others, marked the quietly return of the 'Dongwu legal system' after the wave of robbery. \\n'Town Counter', 'Bathing' and Adjustment\\nOn the night of April 27, 1951, the 36-year old Soow Law School turned straight. \\nOn this night, Shen Zhenwei, acting president and dean of the law school of Dongwu University, was arrested at his residence at 39 Fumin Road, Shanghai. Also arrested were former Provost Esen, director Liu Langquan, Professor Ai Guofan, Lin Wo-Peng, Guo Yunguan and Dongwu graduates Gao Wenbin and others. \\nThis is a unified 'anti-town' remedial lesson in Shanghai, mainly aimed at the principal and professors of old universities. \\nOn the evening of April 27, the Shanghai Municipal Military Management Council and the municipal government organized 4,445 action teams comprising the army, police, cadres, workers, and students, and about 36,000 people. After midnight, a net-pull raids were carried out across Shanghai and detained more than 8,000 people in one run. \\nPrior to the repeated political operation, the law school has left the law school in the midst of the storm, and no one would expect the Military Control Council to do so. [Wuyi Three Press: Who are they? Why is it so hateful to the Chinese people, education to China, to Chinese universities, and to Chinese intellectuals!] \\n'I was well informed, but I didn't hear any wind.' 89 years old Xu Shengqing said. He was the President of the Student Union of Dongwu Law School. Due to the extreme confidentiality of the news, there have also been rumors that public security personnel turn walls into school and take people away. \\nAfterwards, according to the arrangements organized by the underground party, Xu Shengqing announced the arrest of Shing Zhenwei and Osen at the full school student conference. Over the years, the students present at that time were still unforgettable. In their impression, some of the deans who were too serious were pure scholars, and the Provost was a passionate mentor of the ancient trail. \\nIn fact, since 1950, the rejuvenation of serving as a president since the war of resistance has left the school and the teaching of evidence law, and only English is taught. Osen was also removed from the post of Provost. Changes in the political climate have made history complex and less 'progressive' they are no longer fit to preside over school. Well, Ni zheng, who was born from Dongwu, took over as the provost, and invited his brother Yang Zhaolong from Nanjing University to serve as dean, struggling to maintain it. \\nLiu Langquan, director of training, became the target. In September 1950, the Law School sent an application to the East China Ministry of Education to hire three people including Liu Langquan as political class teachers. Only Liu Langquan was not approved. He was replaced by an old district cadre assigned by his superior. \\nAt a time of upheaval, management candidates are just one of the problems encountered by Sooh Law School. Under the new policies of 'abolishing the old legal system' and 'eliminating imperialist cultural aggression', the law school of the Church University of common law and a common law tradition faces death. \\nIn 1950, the Ministry of Education of East China notified the Sooh School of Law to stop recruiting postgraduate students and asked for curriculum reform. The summary report of Dongwu Law School to the East China Ministry of Education in March 1951 on curriculum reform, retained by Shanghai Municipal Archives, contains the following statements:\\n'After liberation, all kinds of reactionary courses have been abolished... In accordance with the spirit of the resolute abolition of the pseudo-six law, many unnecessary courses have been eliminated, and credits for courses such as civil, commercial law and procedure law have been reduced as appropriate-but they still do not have certain guidelines, especially in the Faculty of Law, which is particularly difficult.' \\nNi zheng is one of the signatories of the report. Together with Yang Zhaolong, he tried to preserve the comparative lawfulness of Sooh Law School while adapting to the times. At the end of the report, the Dongwu Law Department has a team of international law, which trains diplomats and administrative staff with a legal foundation, thus focusing on courses in the law of several international organizations and treaties. This is an attempt to replace the 'practical' function of common law for survival under the new regime. But this bitterness is only a fantasy in the context of 'one side down'. Once the curriculum reform program is reported, there is no following. \\nJiang Yunhua, who graduated from Soochow University at the end of 1951, recalled that she had little knowledge of English and American law at that time. 'It is only two years to actually read the law, and in the third year, the old law cannot be learned. There is nothing to talk about, but only political and revolutionary history. Year 12 studied the common law syllabus. It was originally going to the fourth grade of intensive school, and did not study. Those two years, students were mixed!' Jiang Yunhua said. \\nThe main element of 'mix' is to participate in various sports. The political movement was well developed before 1949, and the CCP underground party was well organized. Xu Xibo, who was in love with his classmate Jiang Yunhua at that time, recalled that he 'followed the run' in the form of leaflets, singing revolutionary songs, welcoming the PLA into town, crying out the American Emperor, defending the Soviet Union, and including the use of a fellowship in the form of church organization. \\nAccording to the Law School's report, students participate in any movement, on average thirty or forty at a time. After 1949, the number of people per sport doubled to about 780. The total number of students at Soochow Law School at that time was 571. \\nThere was a contradiction between the student union and the school. Xu Xibo, as a student council member, went to the promotion before leaving office for a meeting for his home. He remembers Shing to be persuasive and must read well. But at that time, 146 Kunshan Road has actually been unable to put a calm desk. \\nBeyond the political movement, there has been a lot of chaos. In January 1951, in January 1951, the Law School reported in a report to the East China Ministry of Education on the restructuring of the school style, that after Liu Langquan left his job and the old training system was abolished, some students blatantly disturbed the order, broke into the classroom, and even molded the girls, 'the school is in a deep crisis'. Although the law school took severe measures to dismiss several undisciplined students, it was not possible to restore the tranquility of its former campus. \\nThe apprehension of others and the ensuing reformation campaign have increased the level of vigilance among the teacher community. Yang Zhaolong's daughter Yang Liming went to Shanghai High School in the summer of 1952, living with his father in the school staff dormitory. Yang Zhaolong instructed her not to contact her neighbors. Yang Liming found that the people around them were nervous, feeling just something big. \\nIn the files of the existing Dongwu Law School, Ni zheng, together with the student union cadres, was kept to visit the country's land reform and anti-U.S. aid, and Yang Zhaolong sent a letter to the East China Ministry of Education to convey information on land reform policy. In the land reform, a piece of land in Jiangwan, which was donated by a gentleman to Dongwu Law School for the construction of the library, was divided into land reform. \\nThe winds of the 'Three Counters' and 'Five Counters' also slightly blown into the walls of schools that are not high. But what is more important is the rethought movement in early 1952. This is a universal political movement across the country against the intellectual community, which is portrayed as 'bathing'. \\nLu Jinbi, who studied at Nanjing University at that time, recalled that NANU, as behind the Central University, had a very strong exercise. Not only was the lecture lecture criticized by the exhibition, but also cried in front of students for examination. \\nSoochow Law School is also a key area. According to the memoirs of Ni zheng, teachers were concentrated in the school and examined in two groups, detailing the curriculum vitae and the process of thinking change. The decision on 'customs clearance' is in the hands of the Party members and cadres stationed by the working group. At this point, the communist organization, which has been underground, is really public. \\nAt that time, Gao Chengde had just graduated from Dongwu Law School as an assistant professor. He generally reviewed his past bourgeoisie thinking and coveted to enjoy. The old teachers, on the other hand, need to criticize themselves in the service of the reactionary government and even join the Kuomintang's history. Xu Shengqing recalls that he and student party branch head Zhuang Yongwen and others on the criteria for crossing the customs clearance of teachers. For teachers with complex social and professional relations, he thinks that they come from the need to support their families, as long as critical ideas become, Zhuang and others require strict control. \\nThe new president Yang Zhaolong, who served as acting as the National Government Attorney General, has become the focus of ideological reform, and even was reported to have hidden a box of gold. It was actually a bookcase that he carried when he returned home. \\nYang Liming recalled that working group staff Wang Mingyuan came home to find Yang Zhaolong and asked him why he had mentioned during the examination that Chiang Kai-shek had dinner, underground party member Wang Xiao and the death penalty case for sabotage of Yangshupu power plant. The latter said that the former had the intention to show off, while the latter was routinely signed with Yang as the Attorney General at the advice of Chiang Kai-shek Mega dragon has nothing to do, do not have to Yang Liming understands that Wang Mingyuan means protecting Yang Zhaolong. However, Yang Zhaolong was finally caught in the case of Wang Xiaolong. \\nXu Shengqing said that after the transformation of the mind, the relationship between teachers and students was completely upside down and cold: students were active in silence, 'dare not to speak out, fear being reported.' I usually meet, the teacher laughs with the students, and stay away. In this precarious campus, a deep gulf has been drawn between the fate of most teachers and students. In December 1951, the graduation of the class in Eleacheng, front or squat or standing students are angry, and Yang Zhaolong and Ni zheng, standing in the back row is melancholy. \\nAt the same time, it was the nationwide 'Clean Up Old Judiciary' campaign, which called for the complete elimination of the judiciary who had been retained at the beginning of the 'establishment of the State' with old legal views. The 'old law' refers to the 'six-law book' system of the National Government, and the common law is naturally excluded. \\nAt the intersection of the three political movements for the transformation of ideas, the cleaning of old law personnel and faculties to adjust the three political movements, the Sooh School of Law has no longer existed. \\n1952 summer vacation, Kunshan Road 146 finally easy to master. \\nIt was an overly hot summer in the history of Chinese universities. Under the name of the faculties, universities with church or Western origin were either withdrawn or severely hit, and the disappeared were Yanjing University, Fu Jen University, and the alma mater of Dongwu Law School. In Shanghai, 17 universities were closed. \\nThe traditional university law faculties were abolished and replaced by six new faculties of political law, replacing the 'old law perspective' with a thorough political and legal thinking. The law departments of Dongwu University and St. John's University, Shanghai University and Fudan University were abolished and incorporated into the newly established East China School of Political Science and Law. The Department of Accounting at Soochow Law School was incorporated into the Shanghai School of Finance and Economics. Students who have completed the third grade graduate one year ahead of time. All lower-grade students are transferred to the East China School of Political Science and Law, while teachers are waiting for distribution. \\nBefore the faculties are adjusted, as usual, focus on learning, unity of mind, and then obey the allocation. Students who were curious about the future did not feel much regret about the demise of their alma mater at that time. Teachers and students were on the future, and they had become taboo. During the anti-right period in 1957, when criticized, Ni zheng confessed that he had 'indeed had emotion' for the suspension of Dongwu Law School. This is a rare expression of regret. \\nIn September 1952, the Dongwu Law School Library was ordered to hand over the 'Reactionary Books' to the East China Ministry of Education, a total of 2,676 copies. The list includes the introduction to educational psychology by Dongwu alumni and Yanjing University president Lu Zhiwei's 'Introduction to Educational Psychology', Chen Heqin's Children's Heart Research in Science, Chen Qiyuan's Democratic Constitutional Theory, Chen Lifu The Theory of Life and the New Testament, etc. \\nRevolved as 'one of the best in the Far East', the library has been in possession of more than 20,000 legal books in 1935 and survived the war of resistance. During the transfer to the East China University of Political Science and Law, the books were dispersed more than 'reactionary books.' Scholar Gao Jishun described in the article 'Shing Zhenzheng as a Legal Elite Educator' that the Dongwu Law School library was destroyed and books swept empty, and some were thrown into the garbage dump as waste paper. \\nA generation of law schools disappears. As the representative of Dongwu Law School at 17 universities in Shanghai, Ni zheng continued to do two years of rehabilitation work at 146 Kunshan Road, custody and transfer files, etc., until 1953, the old site of the Winter Law School was transferred to the newly established Shanghai Institute of Finance and Economics. \\nPrior to the war of resistance, Dongwu Law School was relocated several times. During the 'island' period in Shanghai, Sheng Zhen led the relocation of teachers and students in Sichuan United Shanghai University, Vice Dean Fei Qing and Esen led Shanghai teachers and students to set up China Institute of Comparative Law, to avoid pseudo-harassment, until after victory, return to Kunshan Road. Pan Han-dian was enrolled during this period, and his editor-in-chief's 1944 Law School Annual Journal contains photographs of several sites taken by him and his classmates. On the photo of the old school building No. 146 Kunshan Road, Pan Han's poem: 'There are guests returning, questioning the old Xuan capital, not in the past.' This crippling word became eight years later. \\nIn the archival material, the last fallout of the dying of Dongwu Law School is the documents that the Shanghai Higher Education Bureau requested to destroy some of the archives of Dongwu Law School, Shanghai University and St. John University in 1965. Soochow Law School has to destroy 32 volumes of administrative documents and 61 volumes of student studies. The files retained are evidence of 'American imperialism aggression against Chinese culture.' \\nThree generations of fire\\nFounded in Shanghai in 1915, Soochow University Law School is the first American Christian Church founded in China. After the 'North Var' in 1927, the national government demanded that Soochow University be removed from church jurisdiction and dominated by the Chinese. Soochow Law School hired our 1920 graduate Wu Jingxiong as principal, and in 1924, Shing Zhen as the Provost, began the era of 'autonomy' by Sooh Law School. \\nWu Jingxiongshen and president of the court of the Shanghai Special Administrative Region, the law school relies on its reputation, and the specific teaching design is undertaken by Shing Zhen. After graduating from Dongwu studied at Northwest University of the famous American School of Comparative Law, the rejuvenation of the original English law education of the Sooh University School of Law has been reinvented to form a 'three-track system' comparative curriculum of Chinese law, common law and civil law. In January 1933, the Law School even published the 'Law of Italian Fascist Societies' course, which was studied as 'one of the most creative and expressive political concepts'. \\nDue to the educational purpose of 'heavy weight not weight', Sooh Law School is very strict on the entry threshold for new students, academic examination and graduation. Before the war of resistance, its academic structure was five years, that is, required to complete two years of college preparatory studies and another three years undergraduate. Classroom notes are particularly rigorous. Ni zheng recalls that when he transferred to Dongwu in 1925, the first grade students totaled more than 40 people. Only 13 were left at the time of graduation, the reason is too much pressure to prepare for classes. Former Secretary-General of the new four army Li Yigang once took the same class with Ni zheng, because he had to do underground work and finally dropped out of school. \\nThis high phase-out rate continues until schools are closed near. 1950s graduate Shen Guansheng recalled that it was difficult to admit to Dongwu School of Law. The common law courses were all speaking English, using original teaching materials, and mimicking English-American courts practice jurisprudence teaching. His foreign language is only medium, and the exam can only be barely cleared. 50 students in the class, only 20 graduated. \\nThe elite approach of education makes Soowu Law School's degree recognized by famous foreign universities. This further makes Dongwu graduates have a convenient opportunity to study abroad. Before the war, 15% of students went abroad, Wu Jingxiong, Ni zheng, Yang Zhaolong and others are the beneficiaries. After studying at the University of Michigan in 1920, Wu soon met Justice Holmes of the United States Federal Court and was confirmed by Harvard Law School Dean, Taidou Pond of Law, and later Yang Zhaolong was recommended by Wu Jingxiong from Pond. \\nThey have learned to return and teach at their alma mater, and made the Sooh Law School to realize the self-hematopoiesis of teachers in addition to inviting celebrities, a unique phenomenon in the history of education in the Republic. Wu Jingxiong, Sheng Zhenwei, Yang Zhaolong, Ni zheng, Sun Xiaolou, Esen, Chen Tingrui, Lin Wopeng are all graduates of Dongwu Law School. If Wu Jingxiong recommended student Yang Zhaolong to serve as Dean of Dongwu Law School in 1938, because he failed to realize, by the former Provost Sheng Zhen as the former Provost. Ni zheng also recommended his brother Yang Zhaolong to replace teacher Sheng Zhen as principal, completed the three generations of dean alternation. \\nThe relationship between Dongwu and Wu does not end in teaching and academic transmission. After the 'island', the Provost, Osen, is a typical example of sheltered students. For Xu Shengqing, Esen has a dilemma to help hand grace. Xu Shengqing's brother found tuberculosis in Hangzhou-a chronic disease at the time, forced to go to Shanghai to cure the disease and have no place to rely on. Esen learned that generously allowed him to live at home, eating well, it took half a year to heal. Pan Han-dian joined the bank after graduating from his undergraduate degree in 1944. After the arrest of Osen in 1950, the family was deprived of life. Yang Zhaolong launched Dongwu teachers and students to pick up. The rebellion of old age, also by Dongwu teacher Ji heavy, graduates Nie Changyi, and so on. \\nWhat's not easy to solve is that as the most famous law school in the Far East, Dongwu Law School is always a night school. Sheng Zhen adheres to the hours of classes from 4:30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. at the beginning of the school, so that students can study half work and a large number of teachers part-time. As a result, a large number of students can work part-time before graduation, participate deeply in society, and successfully enter the business after graduation, including Sheng Zhenwei, Yang Zhaolong, Ni zheng and others. More than 40 per cent of the first 18 graduates of law school were professional lawyers. On the other hand, part-time teachers are therefore more socially influential, such as Ethan and Chen Tingrui are famous lawyers, Wu Jingxiong is a judge and a member of the Legislative Council, and Xiang Che Chun is a prosecutor. This makes Sooh Law School's involvement in modern social processes far beyond the energy of a general college. Among them, the '530 Movement' and the withdrawal of extraterritorial jurisdiction, the drafting of the Constitution of the Republic, and the Tokyo trial, are the main joints among them. \\nDuring the '530 Movement' period, the promotion of studying abroad at Northwestern University was to complain of imperialist aggression in Chicago. Yang Zhaolong, who attended Soochow University, served as a member of the National Party as a member of the Law Commission of the Five 30 Trafficult. Alumni Jiang Yiping defended the arrested students. Teacher Chen Tingrui published an editorial appeal in the newspaper Extracting extraterritorial jurisdiction. In April 1925, Chen Tingrui and Dong Kang, as representatives of Shanghai Lawyers Association, went to Nanjing to petition the supervisor Sun Chuanfang. In August of the following year, the authorities drafted the provisional regulations for the recovery of the Shanghai Association of Public Audits. \\nWu Jingxiong began serving as a member of the Legislative Council in 1931. He joined his colleagues in drafting the Civil, Criminal and Commercial Codes that constitute the subject of the 'Six Laws' of the Republic. Wu Jingxiong also served as vice-chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee. In 1934, Wu Jingxiong published the First Draft Draft of Wu Jingxiong's Constitution. \\nIn July 1945, Ni zheng departed to the United States to visit justice. Wu Jingxiong, teacher of law enlightenment at Karachi Airport, India, returned from the newly established UN Charter. Wu is the legal adviser to the Chinese delegation. Among the members of the delegation is Wang Chonghui, the old man of Dongwu Law School. After returning home, the Charter of the United Nations was delivered by Wu Jingxiong to Yang Zhaolong. \\nIn 1946, Ni zheng invited Pang to China as a consultant to the Ministry of Justice Administration. Yang Zhaolong assisted Pang in establishing the Chinese Law Center and preparing the Chinese Law Code to enrich the slightly empty 'Six Laws Book'. Yang Zhaolong also passed the Constitution of the Republic of China, which was just promulgated by the National Constituent Assembly to Pang de. He wrote more than 20,000 words of long text commentary, translated by Yang Zhaolong into Chinese. Unfortunately, the elegance of the constitutional implementation was ultimately lost to the civil war. \\nIn addition, participation in the Tokyo war criminals trial is the most important story of the Dong-Wu Tongren in front and behind the stage. \\nHe was first appointed to attend the Tokyo trial, and was a part-time professor at Soochow University. He referred his brother Mei Ruu House to serve as a judge, as the prosecutor in charge of presenting evidence. He took Dao Shaoheng and Fang Fu Shu, a graduate of Sooh Sooh Law School as a prosecutor and first secretary to the judge. Since then, because the court tried under common law procedures, the burden of proof was heavy. In consultation with Ni zheng, Che Chun Ching decided to add Dongwu Law School professors, Gui Yu and others as prosecutors advisers, with Ni zheng as chief adviser. \\nNi zheng recalls that early forensics are extremely difficult. At the end of 1946, he took snow together with Osen to fly back to Beijing to try traitors in prison, to find Wu Pefu's widow, who was poisoned by the Japanese, and difficult to collect evidence of war crimes of Kenji Tohihara and Shiro Itaigaki. In the end, the court handed over the right of complaint against the two criminals from the Philippines to China, solemnly pleaded to Che Jun and Ni zheng in court, rebutting the defense of Tohibara and Itaigaki, leading the two men to settle the law. \\nBecause the task of gathering evidence was more heavy than imagined, Che Che Chun also selected staff among Dongwu graduates and sent to Tokyo to hire as a prosecutor and secretary for judges. Gao Wenbin, Yang Shoulin, Liu Jisheng, Zheng Luda and others were interviewed. In this way, Dongwu teachers and students formed an echelon line-up in the Tokyo trial, accounting for more than 70% of the total number of legal staff in China. From an old Japanese newspaper, Gao Wenbin found key evidence of the 'killing contest' held by two officers in the Nanjing massacre. Qiao Shaoheng persuaded Puyi, the late emperor Puyi, to testify in court to expose the crimes that the Japanese planned to establish 'Manchuria'. \\nA large number of Dongwu teachers and students went to the Tokyo court, and could not be supported by the prosperity of Dongwu Fu School. At this time, Yang Zhaolong served as the head of the War Crimes Certificate Investigation Unit at the Ministry of Justice, collecting and handing over to the Tokyo court. At the same time as the Tokyo trial, Yang Zhaolong drafted the War Criminals Trial Regulations, enacted in October 1946, after which a large number of Japanese war criminals have been tried in China. \\nThe war criminals trial lasted almost three years. In the early morning of December 23, 1948, he witnessed the execution of seven Class A war criminals including Tohibara at Sugamo Prison on the outskirts of Tokyo. Ni zhe"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "ng mentioned in his memoirs this hardship, still 'tears and can not calm down'. \\nAt this time, the civil war artillery has approached Shanghai, and the Soow Law School is about to end its mission in the history of the rule of law in the Republic. \\nEven after 'abolishing the old legal system', after half a century of buried, the subtle afterlight of Dongwu law did not disappear, but dazzled at a time of historical fault. \\nBuried formations\\nAfter the turmoil of 1952, Dongwu teachers and students went through the fate of being overturned by political strata. \\nAfter his arrest, Shing Zhenzheng was sentenced to 12 years for counter-revolutionary crime, was held in Shanghai Tibasqiao Prison, and then there was a farm in North China. This saline-alkali land reclaimed by correctional prisoners has been called 'Subeilia' in a memoirs of an experienced person in recent years. After six years, Sheng Zhen was sent to Suzhou to teach English. Her female Sheng Yun was assigned to rural Anhui to spend half their life in such chores as water to feed pigs. \\nSheng Yun experienced the scene where his father was caught that night. Young she's hard to understand how the father of a lifetime love student was charged with the charge of 'providing a blacklist of students'. This mystery was unveiled until 1980 by Dongwu graduated graduate students Nie Changyi and Xu Panqiu, Dean of East China University of Political Science and Law. \\nAt that time, the re-school of East China University of Political Science and Law was looking for talent. Because of translating the English and American criminal laws, Nie Changyi often went to Suzhou to ask teachers Sheng Zhen for advice, knowing that the teacher has not yet been rehabilitated, that is, to report to Xu Panqiu. Xu Panqiu went back to Shanghai after he went to Suzhou to learn about the case. After a review by the Shanghai court, finally confirmed that Shing Revolved as innocent and repudiated. Sheng Zhenwei was able to return to Shanghai and served as an adviser to East China University of Political Science and Law, and spent his old age in Fumin Road. \\nAccording to a review, Sheng Zhen was arrested at the time because the student of this school and an underground party member Zhuang Yongwen reported that he 'provided blacklists to the Police Command and suppressed progressive students.' At that time, after the arrest of a group of 'vocational students' (clandestine party members of the Communist Party of China), Dongwu Law School posted a notice explaining the matter in accordance with the usual practice. The announcement is the only evidence, but it is precisely the fact that at a meeting of university leaders convened by the Police Command, Prosperity had personally accused the police of arresting students. \\nNot only that, only Zhuang Yongwen's personal signature on the report opinion, does not represent the opinion of the underground party branch. But it was this personal report that sent prosperity to his family for 30 years. In court, the rejuvenation of familiarity with the law of evidence provided self-defence, but did not receive a chance of confrontation. \\nAccording to Xu Shengqing and the record of Lu Jinbi's interview before Xu Panqiu's birth, Xu Panqiu once talked twice to Zhuang Yongwen, then party secretary of the East China University of Political Science and Law, asking him to visit and apologize to his mentors of that year, 'The ring still needs to ring people'. But until the death of Shengzheng in 1997, Chong Yongwen never made any indication. \\nAt the same time, Dean Ossen, a Ph.D. Stanford University, has participated in the Tokyo trial, the 'Seven Gentlemen' rescue, etc., on the grounds of being associated with the Blue Red gang of the Shanghai gang. Because of his extensive practice of lawyers, he used his social energy to support the survival of China's Comparative Law School almost alone. There are rumors that he was a disciple of Du Yuesheng in his early \\nIn Shanghai, where the gangs are well established, such struggles are not uncommon. Famous lawyers including Zhang Shizhao and Jiang Yiping had close ties with Du Yuesheng and Jin Rong, known as 'eating rogue rice'. In the Seven Gentlemen case, the lawyers team also asked Toto Du Yuesheng to rescue Shen Junru and others. \\nAfter three years of arrest, Osen was revoked in December 1956, and later served as a librarian for 'waste use' and died in 1970. \\nLiu Langquan, director of training, graduated from Soochow University Law School in 1932. He was a professor at Nankai University. As a member of the KMT, he was arrested because of contradictions between his duties and student party members. A 'trail material registration form' maintained by the Shanghai Archives shows that Liu Langquan joined the Kuomintang in the early days of the resistance, and later served as the secretary-general of the Zhejiang provincial government and a county minister. Although he has not attended the meetings of university directors convened by the old government and helped students organize new student councils, he is still unavoidable in the name of 'reactionary'. \\nTung Wu Law School professor Ai Guofan and Lin Wo-pong were also arrested. Ai Guofan is Dongwu graduates and experts in international law with Ni zheng. According to Gao Wenbin, Ai Guofan served as legal adviser to the Swiss Consulate and familiarize himself with the consulate in Shanghai. At the beginning of the 'liberation', the Military Control Council had asked him to provide information in the concession. Ai Kwok Phan did not cooperate, and was later accused of being an agent left behind by the KMT. Prior to his arrest, Gao Wenbin, a student who had participated in the Tokyo trial and worked at the Shanghai Foreign Office, was also charged with 'stealing confidential intelligence for KMT agents'. Ai Kwok Phan was sentenced for seven years and Gao Wenbin was sentenced for 10 years On appeal in prison, Ai Kwok Phan was sentenced to life imprisonment and died in prison. Gao Wenbin stayed for employment after completing his labor sentence on a farm in Subei and Jiangxi, before returning to Shanghai in 1979. \\nLin Youpeng, a teacher of civil procedure law who taught the English and American law, was also sentenced for having served as president of the old court. After the Cultural Revolution, he has been living on the second floor of the old Shikumen House in a lane in Shanghai Hongkou District. In the 1980s, Xu Shengqing traveled to Shanghai to visit, students and teachers. On the photo, the old house wall pink fade, mullion paint peeling, the interior is poorly furnished, the old man's white hair lock. \\nCompared to those arrested, more Dongwu people, represented by Yang Zhaolong, are suffering in the ensuing political movement. \\nFor teachers who represent the 'old law concept', 'waiting allocation' has become abandonment, and most people are left idle for one to two years. The work that was then arranged was nothing more than teaching English, Russian, or working in a library or a library or a library. There are even professors assigned to bus companies selling tickets and reading meters to the Power Authority. After the withdrawal of Ni zheng at the remaining place, he was assigned to Tongji University to teach Russian. Yang Zhaolong spent two years and transferred to Fudan University to teach Russian in the autumn of 1954. During this period, the collection of counter-material against him has begun quietly, with a focus on 'killing Wang Xiaohe'. Fortunately, the anti-censors housing group sympathized with Yang Zhaolong's encounter, asked the superiors to reject the arrest, instead of 'internal control' (see 'The back and tooth marks of Yang Zhaolong', Issue 25 of Finance 2012). \\nBy the time of the 'anti-right' movement in 1957, the previously surviving group of Dongwu Tong-Wu was no longer spared. \\nYang Zhaolong, who published a series of articles during the 'Snake Out of the Hole', as well as his speech at the colloquium stressed the inheritance of the law and criticized the nothingness of the law. It was logical to put on the right hat, and later reckoned against old accounts and escalated into a counter-revolution, and once faced the death penalty. Yang Zhaolong's son and son-in-law were implicated in prison and his wife committed suicide. It was not until the late 1970s that he was released in the name of the Kuomintang war criminals amnesty and died lonely in a small town in Haining County, Zhejiang. \\nAt the beginning of 1960, Wang Pingsheng, a 1952 student of Dongwu Law School and Yang Zhaolong met at the bus station at the junction of Jiangsu Road in Shanghai. Yang said, 'They treat me well, give me 100 yuan for January, don't do anything.' Both sides are full of rhetoric, but they do not dare to complain, hurry and farewell. Yang Zhaolong raised his hand to greet Wang Pingsheng 'take The two had not expected, teachers and students would never be farewell. \\nWei Wenda, a graduate of Dongwu Law School and former professor of sea law, owned a shipping company, was beaten into the right because of dissatisfaction with the public-private partnership. \\nSun Xiaolou, a 1927 graduate of Dongwu Law School and former professor of labor law and former president of Chaoyang Law School, was also hit the right for Yang Zhaolong speech, and died in 1958. \\nGuo Yunguan, an expert in private international law, who had been nominated as a member of the Central Research Institute, had been unemployed after the faculty adjustment. In 1959, he was beaten as a counter-revolutionary as a former judge, seeking medical care outside the trial, and died in 1961 in starvation, until 1985. \\nNi zheng, who served on the Treaty Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, made remarks criticizing the 'cleaning of the old judicial personnel' in 1952 and proposed that the comparative law 'rescue people, rescue books, rescue class' was called 'middle right' to control the use. \\nFei Qing, Ph.D., University of Berlin, 1929 graduates of Soochow Law School, is a teacher with close ties to Han-dian Pan. Fei Qing has always appreciated Pan Han-dian, guided him to contact the new Soviet law, encouraged him to persist in academic practice after employment, and recommended him to Peking University as a lecturer. Among Dongwu teachers, Fei Qing's political views were leaning to the left, and his brother Fei Xiaotong and Fei Zhendong were members of the NLD. In 1957, Fei Qing was treated in Wuxi, Jiangsu due to illness, and his body had improved on the eve of 'anti-right'. The news that Fei Xiaotong and Fei Zhendong were beaten into the right, the condition was sharply turned, and died that month. After their ashes arrived in Beijing, Fei Xiaotong and Fei Zhenzhong did not attend the memorial service. \\nPan Han-dian, who was an associate professor at Dongwu Law School, has failed to escape criticism in the 'anti-right', 'Cultural Revolution'. \\nAfter graduating from Phanhandian in 1949, he received a notice of admission from Yale University, which became a testament to his 'enemy' guilt and was therefore criticized. For most of the years of the Cultural Revolution, Pan Handian spent a dry school in rural areas. \\nIn addition, the prosecutor of the Tokyo trial taught Choshun, Shanghai Institute of Finance and Economics after 1952. Although he retired before the Cultural Revolution, his ears were close to deafness, still being shocked, treated as 'internal contradictions among the people'. With the exception of Cao Jie, Li Haopei and other professors who tend to progress, as well as Chen Tingrui, Jiang Yiping, Qiu Han and others who went to Taiwan, almost none of the Dongwu teacher groups have been spared in the political turmoil. \\nAfter the end of the Cultural Revolution, these former legal elites still spent their years of disability in the cold. When Panhandian and Xue Boin found them in the late 1990s, they either lived in a sunlight attic or crowded with their family behind the screen cubicle, a 9-inch black-and-white TV or a 12-dollar small fan became luxury. Once full of longevity, after the breakage of the times was completely forgotten. The solitude of Shanghai is that only in a conversation with the visiting daughter, Sheng Yun, can we revisit the fine of law and the experience of founding the Dongwu Law School. \\nAs Scholar Ai Yongming said in the general order of 'Dongwu Law Series', 'The experience of 'Dongwu Law after the 1950s is a sadness in the history of modern law in China.' \\nAfter the founding of the Soochow Law School students, although they separated from the fate of their teachers as 'newcomers', they also failed to avoid falling in the context of the era of legal nothingness. After graduation, Xu Xibo and Jiang Yunhua went to Renmin University of China to study graduate students. Only revolutionary history and Marxism-Leninism were not related to law. The two dropped out of school and wanted to work as a lawyer according to Dongwu tradition. At the same time, the 'Banned Black Lawyers' campaign had to go to East China University of Political Science and Law for administrative work and to teach English at secondary school respectively. In 1957, Xu Heber was beaten into the right, allotted to Qinghai re-education farm, risked hungry in the Holodomor, before returning from the 'Cultural Revolution'. \\nXu Shengqing, who once declared Shing Zhen to all teachers and students as the arrest news, was prosecuted in 1955 at the East China University of Political Science and Law as a member of the KMT branch training member, and the family subordinated as a leakage landlord. The old thing in the 'anti-right' renews, and some of his classroom remarks as an assistant in political economics were reported by students. After being beaten as the right, Xu Shengqing devolved the suburbs, and was beaten into a counter-revolution. He was sentenced to three years, escorted Anhui Pujiwei farm labor, open rocks and left for employment after completion of his sentence. Until 1980, he returned to Shanghai and married at age 57, and now lived unaccompanied in the dormitory of the family of the East China University of Political Science and Law. Inside. \\nGao Chengde, like Xu Shengqing, was transferred to East China University of Political Science and Law as assistant professor in political economics. After graduating from the Department of Economics, Peking University, he worked in the Research Office of the Supreme Procuratorate. The case is generally caught by secret agents, without legal knowledge, and because he has no revolutionary qualifications, he cannot handle the case directly. Gao Chengde felt bored, and thought of a way to move to Tsinghua University as an economics teacher, but because the 'anti-right' signed in a large print newspaper, it was almost smashed into the right, and after that, together with the right, devolved labor together. 'Cultural Revolution', elevation de fluke fluke as 'middle right', control use. But any delegated task will fall to the head of Gao Chengde. He has spent 15 years in rural areas such as Jiangxi and Beijing Huairou. Until the end of the 'Cultural Revolution', the Central Party School was still blocked by the relevant departments, believing that Gaochde was politically unreliable. \\nIn these dianpei, Xu Shengqing, Xu Heber and most Dongwu students almost forget about their legal knowledge, especially common law. Their lives have since also been insulated with the law. In the early 1980s, Jiang Yunhua was given the opportunity to teach international law, and had to learn from scratch like a white paper, and kicked 'Tang's wife' day and night for lessons. \\nIn mid-May 2013, some of the Soochow Law School alumni in Shanghai organized a dinner. At the party, Jiang Yunhua learned that the classmates mostly experienced bumpy, the original class leader was missing after hitting the right distribution with Heilongjiang. A lucky man like her who can follow the teachers to the legal forum is not only among the more than 20 female classmates in the class. \\nTranquil afterlight\\nIn 1978, Qian Yongchang, former Minister of Transport and then manager of Shanghai Ocean Shipping Company, found Wei Wenda's staff dormitory of Shanghai Maritime Institute to consult a legal question about an average accident-a million tons of cargo ship in COSCO crashed the local port while berthering in Australia. Wei Wenda told Qian Yongchang to invoke the 'limitation clause on shipowner liability' in the international maritime law, which caused China to bear millions of dollars less in compensation in the final judgment. This is the first maritime transport litigation case in the country since 1949. \\nAt this time, Wei Wenda's right hat has not been removed. It is worth mentioning that in the corner of the School of Maritime Transport, three Dongwu scholars with political caps are gathered: Lin, Wenbin Gao and Wei Wenda. There are student memories, three teachers have a profound influence on them. \\nEven after 'abolishing the old legal system', after half a century of buried, the subtle afterlight of Dongwu law did not disappear, but dazzled at a time of historical fault. \\nThe 1952 Constitution contained a provision that 'politically persecuted foreigners have the right to stay in China', and by the time the fourth draft constitution was published in 1982, the term 'right of abode' remained the same, raising doubts from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Panhandian, who has translated the Constitution of many countries, received a telephone call at this time, stating that, according to international norms, the term 'right of abode' should be changed to 'the right to asylum'. This change was adopted in the final published Constitution. \\nPan Han-dian went to Peking University Law Department on the eve of the faculty adjustment, and then moved to the newly established Chinese Political Law Society as a researcher to compile foreign legal systems and dynamics for a long time. His 'Political Law Translation Series' and 'Study of Political Law', in the seam of the times, carefully opened the only window to introduce Western law before the 'Cultural Revolution'. \\nIn 1964, Pan Han-dian, in cooperation with people, published the Criticism of the 'Court Judgment is the Law' in the Study of Political Law in the United States. Student Bai Sheng commented that in the name of criticism, the article introduces the essence of common law 'case law' in the name of 'positive law'. The notes are more standardized, and the academic smell is very rare in the full publication. \\nIn the same year as the Cultural Revolution broke out, Pan Han-dian also translated the Constitution of Japan. At that time, many years published such compiled articles under pseudonym, but Pan Handian, Wang Tieya, Gong Xiangrui and Shen Zongling were few people. \\nAfter the 'Cultural Revolution', in 1978 Pan Han-dian was appointed editor-in-chief of the Law Translation Series. The major contributors include Ni zheng, Li Haopei and other Dongwu old people, who have reenlightenment for the intergenerational Chinese legal community. Chen Guangzhong, former president and lifelong professor of China University of Political Science and Law, said that 'Law Translation Series' has a great impact on him, and must see each issue because there was little understanding of English and American law before. \\nIn 1987, under the active push of then-President Jiang Ping, China University of Political Science and Law established the first comparative law institute in China, with Pan Han-dian redeployed as director. It has been more than 40 years since he attended the 'China Comparative Law School' during the war of resistance. \\nEarlier in 1972, 'New China' replaced Taiwan with a seat in the United Nations, and Ni zheng attended the General Assembly as Legal Counsel. It is worth mentioning that Chen Tingrui, who travelled to Taiwan in 1949 and founded Dongwu University in Taiwan, had launched a campaign to maintain the 'Republic of China' United Nations seat at the age of 70. \\nIn 1983, Ni zheng attended a meeting of the International Law Commission to discuss the issue of 'Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind'. At the meeting, the issue of 'national crime' was debated. Based on the experience of the Tokyo trial, Ni zheng stressed that individual crimes could not be blamed on the State and should bear separate obligations. Since then, the United Nations established the International Criminal Court, which directly contributed to the trial and accountability of Milosevic, Gaddafi and others. \\nThe following year, Ni zheng was elected a judge of the International Court of Justice in The Hague. This was the first judge of the United Nations Court of Justice in China since 1949. Subsequently, Li Haopei, Dongwu Xuejian, served as a judge of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. Both were nearly nine years old when they were elected. Together with Wang Chong-hui, the first United Nations judge, Dongwu Law School contributed three judges of the International Tribunal, which is also unique in the history of modern rule of law. \\nAfter the end of the 'Cultural Revolution', the legal system was rebuilt, and civil law scholars, mainly with the Liusu community, stepped out of the dust of history and became a central pillar. The group of Anglo-American law scholars represented by Dongwu Tongmen, although still marginalized as a whole, is still marginalized, but in the demand of the era of opening up to the outside world, has been ordered and shining. This became a collective portrayal of the situation of the Dongwu people after the Cultural Revolution. \\nIn 1979, Jiao Shaoheng, a professor at the Shanghai Institute of Foreign Languages, was recruited to serve as adviser to the Special Court of Jiang Qing and Lin Biao's Anti-Revolutionary Group Case. At the hearing, Jiang Qing's court loud rebuked the judge, causing the trial to run out of control. Qiao Shaoheng was ordered and stuck into the data room to find the case of 'eviction of the defendant convicted' in the US court. Since then, Jiang Qing was expelled from the court, responding to the concerns of international public opinion. Six years later, the withdrawal of Hong Kong was put on the agenda, and Cao Shaoheng was elected to the Drafting Committee of Hong Kong's Basic Law. Also on the committee is Wong Yuk Lun, a graduate of Soochow Law School. Gao Chengde introduced, proficient in comparative law, English and excellent Huang Yulin, in the drafting of the basic law has the power of 'carrying'. \\nIn 1984, a private economic legal advisory body called 'Revitalizing Company' was established in Shanghai. The chairman of the company is Xu Panqiu, former president of East China University of Political Science and Law. Directors, consultants, consultants and consultants have accommodated more than 200 legal scholars, most of them are Dongwu teachers and students, such as Sheng Zhenwei, Li Wenjie, Qiao Shaoheng and others. Ni zheng, who went to The Hague as an international judge, learned that the teacher was 'out of the mountain' and sent a message of 'gratitude, comfort and encouragement.' Xu Heber served as the company's liaison director and often went to Shen Zhen to send consultancy fees to his home. Shengzhen is because he was arrested before the faculty adjustment, there is no retirement salary for the unit. After serving as consultant to the East China University of Political Science and Law and the revitalization of the company, life in old age has been guaranteed. \\nRevitalizing the company has established law firms and foreign economic legal advisory center. In 1990, the Institute of Comparative Law Further Education was established. It has trained a large number of international civil and commercial legal talents, and has played a catalytic role for the opening up of Shanghai's economy to the outside world. \\nIn 1993, Sheng Zhen received the Silver Star Medal of Honor for the Administration of Justice issued by the Ministry of Justice, commending his contribution to legal education. On 22 April 1997, Shengzheng passed away and finished a rough life. \\nA few days before his death, he was also involved in the review of the Sino-French Dictionary of Yuan Zhao. This is a collective work of the Dongwu Tongren community after the disappearance of Dongwu Law School more than 40 years later. As early as the Shanghai island era, Osen organized four students such as Pan Han Dian to compile a English-American and French dictionary. More than 50 years later, Pan Han-dian, as the chief review, and young scholar Xue Bo have sought out the old Dongwu people living in Shanghai and participated in the compilation of the dictionary. Under his visit, he learned that the old people of Dongwu Law School are in a humble situation and do not waste their studies, 'there is a sense of sense, revealing reverence.' \\nThese old people, who have lost their lives, put their energy and effort into this large dictionary, which has not received any official funding, but filled the gap in history. In addition to Pan Handian, Ni zheng, Yao Qi-type, Lu Jun, Yang Tieliang, Cai Jin, Xu Kai-shu, Gao Wenbin, Yu Weiyi, Gao Chengde and other 20 people. In addition, Qiao Shaoheng and Huang Yulin participated in the proposal. During the six-year dictionary editing and publishing process, most of the reviewers on the list had gradually died. With more than 4.6 million words, this dictionary contains more than 45,000 entries, three times more than the English-French dictionaries published in Japan, making it an indelible tombstone for the old people of Dongwu. On the title page of the dictionary, the title reads 'This book is dedicated to Alma Mater and the Motherland'. \\nBeginning in 2005, Soochow University, behind Soochow University Wang Jian Law School, began editing and publishing 'Dongwu Law Pensor Series'. East Wu Xianxian income of Wencong has a total of nine, including Yang Zhaolong, Ni zheng, Li Haopei, Wang Chonghui, Pan Handian, Wu Jingxiong, Qiu Hanping, Sheng Zhenwei and Sun Xiaolou, so far the top five volumes have been published, including Pan Handian is the only living person. \\nAfter the publication of Yang Zhaolong's collection in 2005, 'Dongwu Law', a unique tradition in modern law history, began to be rediscovered from beneath the strata, becoming a good medicine for the relief of mental anaemia in the current legal profession, and an unobsolete academic benchmark. In a long article written by scholars Gao Jishun, Xu Zhangrun and others, the value of 'Dongwu Tradition' has gone beyond purely academic and legal levels to the moral and spiritual heights of modern and contemporary intellectual circles. \\nIt is unimaginable that it was the afterglow of a law school that disappeared for more than 60 years.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached] Zhu Kejian: 'Jinhua Ham Association president is selling cloth origin' (Sina blog 2008.11.23)\\nSelling cloth and making ham is irrelevant to the two industries, however, there is such a coincidence, the president of Jinhua Ham Association are born of selling cloth. The first president Ni zhiji Zhiji was beaten as the right, then delegated to the supply and marketing community in Dongyang Qianxiang District to sell cloth; the second president Shi Yanjun was recruited to Jinhua County Cao House for sale of cloth. \\nIn the planning economic era, selling cloth is an individual envy occupation, easy work, monthly salary, more key is that you can open the back door. Selling cloth what back door is good to open? More, in the age of material scarcity, it is not easy to buy good pieces of material. At the time the most popular is 'really cool' fabric, regardless of men and women, who put on a white 'really cool' shirt, walking on the street can be enchanted, young people find a lot of convenience. I had a primary school student, and now was a news announcer on Zhejiang TV station. At that time, the class was wearing a 'really cool' white shirt, and he was particularly dazzling. At a million people's conference, a firecracker was ordered by a naughty classmates, the shirt was blown up with a hole, and the shirt was never worn again, but the first one wore white Colored 'really cool' shirt male classmates have since had an elegant number 'demolish'. The so-called good material can not only be 'really cool' one, it can be seen how much to sell cloth to eat fragrant. \\nAlthough selling cloth and selling movie tickets, selling pork, shaved head, all belong to the popular industry, but after all, old Ni zhiji was beaten to the right to decentralize, depressed mood, good luck in Dongyang (mei), to him are good, especially those big girls little sister-in-law, in order to point a little cloth, desperately stuck him, not laughing old Ni zhiji Xinli is still happy. Here again to say that zero cloth, a cloth sold to the end, the remaining piece of material that can not be ready-to-wear, is the zero head cloth. Supply and marketing agencies stipulate that selling a zero head cloth can not receive cloth tickets, how much concessions are that? No cloth ticket to sell a piece of cloth, big girl sister-in-law patchwork, a pants slit or a small vest was born, big girl sister-in-law heart is happy to blossom. Small-head cloth is so good but not every day, even more than everyone can buy. Zero cloth never put on the table, but hidden in the counter, see acquaintances come out. Old Ni zhiji had such a big back door, how could the sister-in-law of a thousand Xiang's big girl not beat him. Although the days passed happily, but old Ni zhiji still looked forward to returning to the city as soon as possible. Decentralization was unfair treatment for him. Having suffered unfairness, it is especially necessary to look at the fair, old you in the future journalist career especially love to beat unevenly, so that in the Jinhua Ham trademark dispute, a breath more Zhejiang food company played a lawsuit for 20 years, thus achieving his ham cause. \\nShi Yanjun voluntarily engaged in selling cloth industry. In the good days of selling cloth, Shi Yanjun has learned from the zero head of the gap between the planned economy and the market economy, and Schi Yanjun, who is not willing to do so, started a private ham factory very early, and has also achieved a cause of ham. \\nIf the president of Jinhua Ham Association are sold cloth born this is a pure coincidence, it can also be said that the experience of selling cloth is their future achievements in the life of ham."}

At the beginning of the wind, the Central Committee also invited the democratic parties to help the Communist Party to rectify the wind in order to reflect mutual supervision and photograph. The top figures of very individual democratic parties misunderstood the party's sincere desire and made a series of overstated statements that, after being published in the newspapers, caused some intellectuals to make successive difficulties to the party. The People's Daily then published an editorial 'Workers Speak', calling on the working-class to act and resolutely crush the rampant attacks of the bourgeois right. In this regard, the whole wind in the party stopped, and turned into anti-right struggle within the city (not conducted in the countryside). Any speech article involving attacks or criticism of the 'three red flags' (overall route, great leap forward, cooperation), or overly aggressive criticism to leaders at all levels is regarded as 'right-wing rhetoric'. Serious characterization as right-wing elements. Municipal Committee (Jinhantai District), designated me as the head of the anti-right struggle at the government level, and I was the head of the government office. The fight against the right under my auspices did hurt some good people. \\nRan xiufeng Xiufeng, cadre of industry and commerce, who graduated from high school and took part in his work soon, because he wrote a signed letter to the People's Daily reflecting the shortcomings and problems of cooperation, the newspaper sent the original letter to the municipal government, was at the height of the struggle against the right. With this letter he opposed cooperation. The real evidence, after the criticism, the City Committee approved the characterization as 'right-wing elements'. \\nZhang Yaosu, a cadre in the production and construction department, usually silenced, couldn't catch his right-wing words and deeds. Only some rhetoric about social dissatisfaction with the society at that time was found from his diary, was also beaten as the right. \\nThe municipal party party anti-right leadership group was composed of municipal workers, youth and women leaders. Zhou Zhaoxuan, secretary of the Communist Party Committee, had a good origin composition, designated as right-wing elements, and informed the city delegate to Xi'an to get Zhou back. After the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the Party, these grievated comrades were completely repudiated and the original wage treatment was restored.

Some of our college teachers and students rallies wrath war Na zhiliangzhiliang (Guiyang Normal University Journal 1957.10.5)\\nOn October 5, teachers and students from the three faculties and other departments began a fierce war with the right-wing cadre of the Chairman of the CDC. At the meeting Na zhiliangzhiliang made a 'Review', which admitted that he lost to the party attack. But he did not bow to the people to confess guilt and refused to account for his consistent anti-party, anti-socialist words and deeds. Counter decorate yourself as a kind person. He was not the head of the 'CDC' and 'Wind', but rather a 'participant', not a conscientious opposition, but a 'awareness' issue. He divided people into three and nine, his lowest rank, so he made a mistake. Is Na zhiliangzhiliang, the right-wing, a problem of knowledge only? Wu Xixian pointed out angrily: Na zhiliang Chi Leung was born in an exploitative class and was educated by the KMT reactionary since childhood, and had participated in the Three Youth League. He was determined to give Chiang Kai-shek as a hit at secondary school. So he was pampered by secret service instructors, and he was at school. And colluded with the daughter of an agent through her with the agent. He had been involved in a large smoky group in opium trafficking and had always fought to fool people. \\nAfter liberation, he was deeply dissatisfied with the party and the government. He himself admitted that in order to touch the bottom of the Communist Party, he took part in the work. He hated the socialist system, attacked the three countervails and cooperation, and called 'not as it was.' Mess it today. He slandered our school and said: 'The street is uneven, the light is unknown and the water pipe is bad.' With a recalcitrant attitude towards the construction of the motherland, he said that repairing Beijing Road is 'Li Min self-supporting Are all this vicious stigmatization a problem of awareness? Tian Xingwen (Miao), said angrily: he also often disrupted national unity and fabricated rumours that ethnic minorities often rob cooperatives. Is this intriguing problem also an understanding problem? Zhang Gengtao said: 'He is hostile to the Soviet Union, hate progress. When newspapers report an increase in grain production in a certain place, he always said that this is not true.' Why black white? Thus, the right-wing activist Na zhiliangzhiliang's anti-party is committed. He called for the abolition of party groups in schools. He actively advocates for greater democracy, and it is not coincidental to the Organizational and Development Committee. It is his class and historical roots. \\nNow let's look again, is Na zhiliangjiliang a mere participant of the CDC, just a 'pawn'? The right-wing elements first revealed: 'Na zhiliangzhiliang held a preparatory meeting of the CDC long before the school congress spoke.' It is clear that Na zhiliangzhilang has long prepared: 'Call on teachers across the country to rise over the Party Central Committee, overthrow the proletarian dictatorship and implement bourgeoisie dictatorship.' The right-wing activist Ai Xuecheng revealed: 'When Wind was not yet established, Na zhiliangzhiliang negotiated with me to set up a publication.' Does this not mean that Na zhiliangzhiliang is the planner of the CDC and the 'Wind' issue? Na zhiliang Zhiliang held a series of secret and public meetings in the CDC and held a series of secret and public meetings and held a series of anti-party activities with the former. For example, go to primary and secondary schools to ignition; they have directed their subordinates or personally went to national teachers, forestry schools, Guiyang six middle school, four middle school, shidong primary school, and your teacher... Na zhiliang Zhiliang also personally introduced his experience to the right-wing elements of the Agricultural College and told them to play. \\nAfter the anti-right struggle of foreign language students deepened, popular enthusiasm has increased. The insidious face of the right was quickly exposed, and 11 right-wing elements have now been uncovered. Many are fought, or surrendered, only a few are still relentless. For three weeks, the fourth graders of the Russian language department have been fighting with the three right-wing elements in the class, Qu Daoyong, Tang Jiexing, Dang Shouzhuang, and so on. After denouncing his ugly history and the anti-socialist nature of the anti-party anti-socialism, the heinous right-wing element, has had to lower his head in front of the masses. Although the rightists were doing their best in the struggle, they tried to push everything to the blurred ideological understanding, and only put on themselves the hat of an empty right. However, the students used a variety of methods of struggle: such as organizing a rotational war group to expose and criticize the main opposition party's words and deeds, to conduct a whole class debate, and use the form of large print, poetry, and comic forms to expose his opposition face fully in front of the masses. At the same time, he should be vigilant about what he is. These are what they planned the day after the establishment of the Commission. \\nChen Jun said: 'At that time Na zhiliangzhiliang held a meeting, to push the movement to the whole country, and ordered to go to all primary and secondary schools in Guiyang immediately.' Does that say that Na zhiliangjiliang is still a puppet? In front of these iron facts, although Na zhiliangzhiliang has been deceived, but this old and slippery hardliner still refused to bow to confess guilt, and continues to put poison. That attitude of Na zhiliangzhiliang caused the anger of the masses, and the notes that asked to speak, drove to the podium. Xu Dashun and Shen Tiancai angry said: Until today's meeting, he is still attacking the party. He slandered our party and said 100 incidents 99 were right, and one thing was wrong. And the vicious example of the Soviet Union's criticism of Comrade Stalin: it is known that the Soviet Union's illusion of 'glorious history' has also been debunked, but turned out to be nothing more than an ambition to the extreme. \\nThe drafter of the reactionary 'Protest Book' Party Shouzhuang. When classmates struggled with other right-wing elements, he pretended to be honest and wrote the 'Review Book' with many words. However, not only did not well account for a series of anti-party words and deeds, but also on some of the main issues, he spoke about its so-called 'literary views', but everyone's eyes were shiny. In the fight against him, everyone revealed that he was vigorously advocating for greater democracy in the revelation. In the Russian-language system, it was him that he had to surrender his arms under the pursuit of the masses. \\nThe three Russian departments have captured five right-wing elements-Xiong Qingshan, Li Guangyao, Huang Xingyi, Yang Peide, Ouyang Jidao. All of them have always been dissatisfied with reality. Since liberation, they have carried a heart that hates the Communist Party, hated a new society, dreamed of the restoration of capitalism, and the Kuomintang returned, they would continue to live a luxurious and rich life and enjoy a corrupt parasitic life. The essence of their reactionary is the most explicit and thorough exposure during magnification. One shows an ugly, ugly face. In recent weeks, after hard chase by classmates, the right-wing elements Yang Peide and Ouyang Ji have surrendered to the people, have surrendered more profoundly criticized their reactionary words and deeds, and said they would be painfully changed and re-engaged. Lee Kuan Yew, the most insidious and spicy right-wing, is still recalcitrant and refuses to talk about. Rightist Bear Aoyama is a corrupt and dirty bourgeois individualist. He was born (take a number of words). \\nThe editorial room of Guiyang Normal College, Supplement No. 51 (to take a few words), Central's criticism of Comrade Stalin did not deny him everything, Comrade Khrushchev said that he was still an outstanding Marxist. These Na zhiliangjilians don't know, but why would he say that? His words just finished, another classmate immediately stood up and questioned: 'You slandered the party members as corrupt people. You said that you were in the party to take a car, saying you are a 'brave warrior' against the dark side of life. Do we all have cars for our party members? The dark side of our lives, where to tell you? To say that our society has a dark side, that is, our society also has a handful of maggots!' Under the pursuit of the masses, Na zhiliangzhiliang is caught in a paradoxical situation. \\nHe said that he was 'only satisfied with a monogamous life', but asked him why he had always messed up relationships between men and women and coincided with the daughter of the agent? Why organize a 'development committee' in an attempt to come to a 'Hungarian event'? He couldn't answer that he had to live a life of corruption in the host and bourgeois family. \\nAfter three and five against the bourgeois transformation, they hit the rampant attacks of the bourgeois, destroying his family's economic strength. He was extremely dissatisfied and hateful. In the magnification song, he abused Chairman Mao, saying that he wanted to kill Minister Yang Xiufeng's head and tried to incite 'great democracy' and overthrow the party leadership. His style of thought was also very bad, and his head was filled with a decadent bourgeoisie view of love. \\nThe right-wing, Lee Kuan Yew, is as cunning and as fiercely as Xiong Qingshan. He hoped that the 'Hungarian incident' would occur in China and attempt to organize the army to overthrow the People's Republic of China and overthrow the Communist Party. He also sang songs for the counter-revolution and deeply sympathized to the landowners 'families. Due to his extreme dissatisfaction with the reality, he thought of Hong Kong and went to Japan to go to imperialism and become a shameless traitor. Huang Xingyi, a right-wing member, was brutal and unreasonable, and his thought was quite reactionary Early despised by the masses. Now, their reactionary face has been exposed naked to light. \\nAfter the start of school, Russian classmates reorganized the team and put into the battle with a new heroic combat posture. In the face of the fact of iron, the right-wing elements succumbed to poverty and went no way, and had to begin to bow to plead guilty. \\nLiu Kexu, a right-wing affectionist who has always been obsessed with the bourgeois way of life, hateful to the Communist Party, shouted to make a revenge for his counter-revolutionary father. Join democratic parties to gain momentum in order to resist the party's chambers; try to revive capitalism. When he was caught, he tried to slip over. After several rallies, he turned down everything. [In] for the second 'review', changed the tactics; under the big hat. The masses have long been familiar with his set of 'magic treasures', and have criticized him for his intransigence. Originally, this right-wing element, he said to the former before the struggle: 'Zhang Qixian's review is a long time. The leadership group thinks a bit of sincerity. I also want East Lasie for a long time in two days, they will say it well.' And he said, 'I am a hard man, at best for three years!' He established a defensive alliance with the former: the first stage is to refuse to account, and the second stage is to prepare the case. In order to maintain his alliance with once, rumor threatened to say: 'Director Yang said, my problem is not big, the key problem is in you.' However, for now, the right-wing elements have already begun to plead guilty to the people, and classmates welcomed his progress. However, to this completely isolated right-wing backbone, Na zhiliangzhiliang, the classmates insisted that if he did not surrender his arms again, they asked the government to deal with it in accordance with the law. \\nBai Fu Li, Yuan Changwen (there is a word), fallacy, the original shape is revealed, he had to bow his head to plead guilty. The right-wing female, Zhang Yachang, has always been insidious and crafty, hate party members, often self-occupied with old cadres. Actively supported the 'Development Committee' and 'Protest Book' in the revelation, and organized classmates to pass the decision to dismiss public classes. Using the technique of 'pulling the middle, isolating party members, combating progress', has done a series of anti-party actions. The right-wing, Wu Qichao, is extremely hostile to our party, our people's power. defamate the wise leadership of the Communist Party as 'the parents' rule of Prince Zoe' and the people's power as 'the separate government of men and men.' In the light is more intoxicated in engaging in 'big democracy', inciting everywhere, ignition everywhere. \\nAt the rally of the Russian system on June 18, the venue was manipulated to force students to pass reactionary 'Protest Book' and make inflammatory statements, exerting pressure on the venue, ludging the dean and head of the department, and fomenting the anti-party fire in the Russian-language system. Our struggle has achieved a basic victory. We will also continue to fight with the posture of battle, with confidence and triumph in pursuit, further expand the results, not completely break down the right will never receive soldiers! \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"}

When we were in Luoyang, we stayed in the same hospital and went to school at the same school. The first meeting was a simple exchange for each other's life situation. He told me that he left from office after making a mistake from the theatre troupe, and had divorced Kong Lingyu.. I also told him my situation, and I said, 'I and my loved one left Zhengzhou at the same time after making a mistake at the same time. I returned to Kaifeng, and he went to the countryside to supervise production. I broke off letters in April 1960, and now I live with two children and work at the chemical factory.' And also exchanged addresses of both sides. Based on the basis of past knowledge, he constantly came to the house, sometimes also invited me to play at his house, and boast of how well his house was waiting, I always had several times he said I didn't remember, and once he asked me to eat at his house after work (then I was on a self-standing street, which is now self-reliant street. factory site), he said he would cook, he cut the turnips can be fine! When I was off work he stood at the door, I went into his house, I ate rice soup, radish (cold), in his house, after meals, we both recalled what was going to school, a bit of crap, the early winter weather had been holding lights, I said it wasn't early, I left! Nan said to sit down again, I said no, stood up and left, but he reached out to the door, and the coal lights were twisting small, so he pulled and pulled. At that time, I was very afraid, I had unfair gender relations with him during the break. At that time, I was only worried about finding out that my colleague did not consider the identity of the right. Since then, we have more frequent exchanges with the sun and moon, sometimes the daily chores of each other take care of each other, ostensibly called his uncle, but our unjust relationship is really like a couple. \\nIn 1963, my first conception was an abortion made at the workers' cinema-to-door health care at the expense of him. \\nIn 1964, Caomen Street was the same as the last time, probably he accompanied me to register the number, paid the money, he went to see once and bought me some eggs during his stay in hospital. \\nThe second time he was still in Caomen's maternal and child health station. He went to see me in the afternoon after the surgery, and I went home with him. \\nBecause the two of us are very close, sometimes he will come to my house twice a day on a car, and he also made a bad influence in the masses, plus his three-foot hairy, no positive temper, I also think about him as much as my Yuxi, and then think more about the opinions that the masses give themselves is advantageous In my transformation, it was decided by apathy, less contacts, straight in 1965. There has been a fundamental disconnection, and even the trivia of life can't ask each other. \\nOnce he had a high fever, he had a needle every four hours. I first pulled him to the staff hospital with a shelf car, and then I took him to my house, to go to the hospital in four hours, and he went to the hospital after he was ill. \\nAnother time he was sick, I went to his house to take care of him. \\nWhen I pull the car, I don't load the car, sometimes take the pallets home on the first day, the next morning, in this case he helped me to load the car, load the car, send me to town, sometimes pick me up with my bike, and take people back. \\nOne summer, we used a coal fire to cook and eat at my house. He said it could save coal and take care of each other. Who we were free to cook, (at that time the children would not do anything), sometimes he cooked well, sometimes he took some rice, noodles, dishes and other his own food from his home. Mainly I have to bear. \\nRemember when I was not pregnant, I was afraid of being pregnant. I asked him, I said I wanted to get pregnant. Did he say pregnancy was my child? Can you get pregnant and you don't agree? Didn't I back a black pot for you? He said I had a black pot for you too. \\nI remember that there was a New Year's Eve, he bought some dishes and meat, and he gave dumpling stuffing. The next day, he came to eat together, we ate together, and went to see a movie with the children. In 1965, he just sent me a few pounds of meat. He didn't come to my house for dinner. \\nHe was happy to my kids to help them silently word, give sugar to eat, and occasionally wash their heads. \\nFor a long time, overall, this is the case, I continue to consider. \\nMy knowledge of the above evil, my transformation over the years can be said to be more than physical transformation, but it is still very not enough to transform the decadent bourgeois thinking deep in my mind. The most hateful only figure for their own moment happy. They turned a blind eye to the national law, knowingly committed, and feared losing a crime. Under the minds of man, delusions are mixed, and the attitude of death is added to sin. However, thanks to the repeated sincere help of the Party and the Government, as well as by Zhou officers and the vast majority of the revolutionary masses, I have to have a preliminary examination of my own sin. I should continue to criticize my bourgeois thinking, seriously repent, completely correct and accept the punishment that the government has given to myself. \\nZhang Canru\\n(1966?), 7.1."}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】Macondo: 'Gourmet' (Internet)\\nIn the late 1980s, while I was still studying, I knew that China had a Nie fengqiao Fengqiao studying food culture. He was an old right, who was then devoled to Qinghai to do a job of finishing ancient books in the library. This job could be an accident for him. Since you can't ask politics or do sensitive learning, let's study on diet. It is said that every food, he made a stack of cards from ancient books. That kind of learning, only he came to do it. After the Cultural Revolution, he opened a column in various dietary magazines. Because he and my classmates are in a school, my classmate is the head of the culinary department. So I began to focus on his article. I think that the old man (the associate professor was in the end of his life), did not eat much food, but his dietary text was undoubtedly gorgeous and colorful. Most of the subsequent dietary articles were deduced from his essays. Unfortunately, he died a few years ago, and China's food culture was a little less glorious. \\nMy brethren fell in love with food culture because of him, and I, uh, have been somewhat affected. Later, after graduation, I had the opportunity to make a revision of food therapy entries for a national dictionary. It seems to have 100 therapeutic food items, which is one of my academic achievements. I remember that the draft fee was 300 yuan. Of course not high, just talk better than nothing. \\nAnd because of this, I am not ignorant about eating this line. I remember that someone opened a pharmacy in Hefei at the earliest, and asked me to be a consultant, and I prepared a recipe for this. However, this pharmacy eventually collapsed, after all, it was excluded in Hefei. Well, what kind of medicinal meal? If it's not good, can you eat it well? Not to mention the good medicine meal, there is always some odor in. \\nGastronomy and become home, I don't know much. Mr. Zhang Qiangmin, Chairman of Shengson Group, is one. Once, at the Xuanwu Hotel, it was a four-star hotel, my brother invited. Because he had not seen it for a long time, he had a little bit of power, began to abuse, ordered abalone and got shark's fin. As a result, Mr. Zhang tasted abalone taste, said it was not done properly, and then analyzed, how not, which process went wrong. It was said that my schoolmate called the chef out immediately, and it was certainly said by Mr. Zhang. I admire this ability to know the problem at a glance. He later saw him several times to review dishes, all at the point. Every surprise in the seat, it is known that this person is alive in the taste of food. \\nThere are also many gourmets in folk. They tend to be hands-on, and some may make only one meal in their lifetime; others are only good at doing a few things. An older brother of Anqing, I know, has always been a chef at home. He cooked the dishes, and he did not even speak of debut, just intuitively. He made braised beef is a must. Later, I said, this braised beef can occupy the Hefei market. An old lady, a graduate of Jinling Women's University, is seven years old, because one of the people I reported had a colleague background with her, so we knew. After knowing, her husband told me that his old companion broiled duck was the most beautiful taste. He tastes all the houses, none of them. Let me be sure to taste the dish she made. This brings my taste. Is there such a great sauce duck? One day, the old lady is interested, and slowly stew at home. When I arrive, this sauce duck is premature. Later end up, a yellowish sauce duck lying in the plate, the entrance is rotten, the taste of fruit is truly pure and beautiful. This sauce duck, I think I can only eat one or two times in my life. \\nNot long ago, I heard that a certain alley sells braised beef, said that only sell one or two hours a day, each time the queuing is very crowded. There are even queues to buy. Because many small and medium-sized hotels, are directly to the store to purchase. The shop is a partnership of five people. It is said that the profit of selling braised beef in a month alone is as high as 500,000 yuan. However, when I heard, I still dare to go, one is afraid of the bitter queuing, the two are afraid of what can't be seen in that delicious thing."}

By this week, it's almost no one! This is because last winter has not been fertilized, this spring has little rain, and no watering, it is no wonder that the flowers are not allowed to open, the life left on the branch is very short, our 'flowers go' policy is so, because in the past neglected care for flowers, not well to nurture and cultivate, now vigorously To maintain the love, enable full growth, timely open bright flowers, one more than one, one than A beautiful one. This is up to the collective efforts of every comrade of us here today. Now is the spring season, some days before the wind every day, blowing sand cover the unpleasant day, but yesterday and today's weather is really exciting, when we feel very pleasant, let us think of 'flowers altogether' to be a 'flower messenger' to make the spring breeze a light rain, good Let all sorts of eye-catching flowers open through the premises of our intelligence house. \\nI would like to quote a poem made by a comrade who participated in 1942, after studying the wind:\\nBetween comrades and comrades, between stars and stars,\\nNot squeezing each other, but shining each other. \\nI appreciate the meaning of this poem, because I think that the relationship between comrades will always be more intimate, not only should be a wish, but also a fact that some of us may die, some go far away, not easy to see, we are still together, cherish each other. We have now seen the beginning of socialism, knowing that it is not a distant ideal, so we are more united and work together for the smooth realization of this highest ideal. Therefore, we must ask our party to strengthen its strength, and the party's power is the expansion of unity. To unite all forces that can be united, there must be broad and correct views, ideas and practices, so we must rely on everyone to make their opinions and make appropriate criticism from the desire for unity. So that all the comrades can be filled with the love of comrades. Therefore, I think that serious and stormy approach is correct and necessary. \\nFor the contradictions within our unit, my personal view that the main contradiction is between leadership and being led for two reasons:\\n1. I feel that one of our biggest drawbacks from the preparation to the present day is that the positive leadership is always trapped in the mudpit of administrative transactivism, causing the price to be busy in personnel, affairs, budgets, budget estimates, making statements, planning transactions, and not noticing that some key fundamental problems should be solved So work chaos, passive, caught sesame mung beans, lost watermelon, put the 'administration In the first place, ignoring the planning tasks, not starting from its own business, forming a general institutionalization. Some comrades even say that our research unit that does practical work is like a Yamen. In it, Director Yuan Dai has the main responsibility, because he personally participated in scientific planning meetings., particularly with regard to the discussion and drafting of mandate 57, his history and history of the establishment of the Intelligence Unit should be said to be It is quite clear, however, our establishment has been eight or nine months, even for almost a year. Let's ask how many achievements we have today? We have received so much funding from the government, so many cadres, and can I say that I have failed to live up to the great mission entrusted to us by the Government? I think it's time to check out our mission. First of all, we want to ask, is it enough to do it? In the past stages, a little bit of work was done, why didn't you do well enough? Can't be done in time? Quantity and quality are problems. Analyze the reasons. My personal feeling is that Mr. Yuan is not in a hurry, he is also very demanding, hoping that our intelligence can indeed play a role in marching into science, as he said in the planning meeting, but he wants to be an official, he knows his society. There will be too many activities and part-time, can not put the spirit of full payment in the place, so he wanted to take care of, think to put a part of the responsibility to Comrades of party members will always be wrong. This will result in an opportunity for a small group headed by 'Comrade Zhou Junlie' to grasp the power inside. As a result, over time, he himself gave up his leadership and turned into a 'senior democracy' with responsibilities and responsibilities. \\nWe think the general ability to work is not high enough, business experience is not enough, in the early days of groping, feel rusty, small hands and feet, these are unexpected, not surprising, but surprising is to stay in a state that does not go back, a little hurry, swallow, call people It is not necessary to be urgent, this kind of practical needs in the face of specific work, Instead of saying that others have committed impatience, chatted to decouple him and said, 'Come slowly, will get good'. I repeatedly told the party organization that I should not be satisfied with a little superficial performance in front of your eyes, but should be drastically to improve the status quo and solve some of the main problems. However, Comrade Zhou was idle every day., Take a good time, Director Zhao goes earlier than anyone else, and may come a little later, and after work, put the matter of a real intelligence firm. Throw to the back of the brain. Comrades of other party members play circles on personal issues every day, nor must they really think about the work of the Intelligence Institute. However, some people have circled in their brains every day for some problems on their work, they can't be solved, and they can't talk to the party's responsible comrades, always have no essentials, all things are dragged, not hurried. Resolving in a timely manner makes it very difficult for people who do specific work. I think this should be the main responsibility of Director Yuan. However, as far as my personal experience is concerned, although Director Yuan is busy, but things come to him, always give you a solution immediately, and he can also take the initiative to think of some problems for my scope of work, and instruct me to do it at any time. Instead, the office is actually leading my work, but gives My work has caused a lot of difficulties, not only being unaware of but not giving the minimum trust and necessary support. As for caring, understanding and care, that's not much more, I want to push myself and people, the hearts of any intellectuals are the same. They only want leaders to face up to their labor and respect their labor, but in our situation, I feel it is difficult for the intellectuals to fully play him. The motivation and creativity, the reason is that the party leader comrades do not understand them well, care for them, I think We have talents and have great potential, but the subjective leadership has not been able to trust the masses, mobilize the masses well, so that each one of them can make full use of their skills and work for the continuous improvement of our work, take out their energies, brainstorm and realistically Do. This kind of administrative transactivism makes our work an organ, a gate, which is the root cause of all contradictions. \\nSecondly, I would like to touch on the form of our organization. I think that the current structure seems to be to cut a whole block into three segments, and the top level of the director, the director (who was missing at that time), the director himself placed on the time and energy of the director himself was both limited, one was not correct Comrade Zhou, who is not well spoken, likes to act on behalf of some of the directors, as well as comrade Zhou. But often decisions are taken secretly, regardless of whether good or bad, pushing on Mr. Yuan, forming a clear group of dragons without the head. In fact, some people are substituted for themselves, and the responsibility for the results is not clear and separate. One of them is separated by many party members with a history of revolution who do not understand business, but actually manipulate everything. Comrade, they are called comrades who lead the collective leadership. In fact, they do not take the masses and commit very serious Dogmatic, empirical thinking is wrong, and sectarian ideas are quite strong. In addition to the following several chambers, a few leaders have more or less problems with their ability to lead organizations. Imagine that a unit's organizational system is divided into such three segments, not ventilated. Usually there is little opportunity to study the work carefully, analyze and discuss it. How much power is such a leadership? Work is not practical, not in-depth and meticulous, what else? Therefore, my personal opinion is that there is a need for a thorough study of correction. \\nDirector → Editor-in-Chief → Digest, Index → Several Professional Groups → Letters, News\\nPay Director → Chief Editor → Other Reports → Information\\nThere is no need to put similar competency conditions in various departments, making appropriate use of each of their strengths. \\nThe above are the two root causes of my inconsistencies: (1), there is no consensus on the ideological understanding, we can not see clearly the purpose of becoming a unit, mobilizing and concentrating all the forces around the needs of business work, to specifically solve various key issues, and then according to According to our conditions and strength, put our planned work tasks in quantity and quality Complete certain indicators. (2), it is necessary to coordinate the leadership relationship at the top of the organization, so that the responsibilities of each leader are clear, and the nature and scope of the work are indeed to be in the minds and not everyone together, otherwise, this way, the fundamental contradictions will not be resolved, and the conflicts that will arise in the future, will It will become more and more complex, and the efficiency of the work is unlikely to be improved. \\n2. 'Gang Tai Gong Here!' \\nBuilding a socialist society and realizing the lofest ideals of mankind. This is a century-old plan, a great cause of thousands of world worlds, the crystallization of the wisdom of the vast majority of people. It is not a handful of people. Therefore, each person has made a foolish contribution, plowing more deeply and moving forward the inevitable occurrence of development. Cut contradictions, be exposed at any time, to deal with them correctly, so that our common cause reduces mistakes , to avoid detours, improve work efficiency and strengthen solidarity are characteristics of collectivism, which is unanimously endorsed by revolutionary workers. \\nHundreds of brainstorming, flowers are laid out policy requires in the comrades to do:\\n(1), spread out-there is something to speak, the grievances to spit, we meet, things to talk clearly;\\n(2), bright bottom-after the problem spread out, everyone has a number of minds, can be properly dealt with;\\n(3), ventilation-more contact with each other, more exchange of views, truly harmonious. \\nTo this end, it is necessary to carry out the essence of 'unspeakable, inexhaustible, innocence of the person and the word'. \\nHowever, past experience has led some comrades to have more or less worries, which can be used to describe the current call by a proverb to inspire everyone to 'no taboo'. \\nOur policy of leading the party is like 'Jiang Tai-gong', is a building stone to ensure the smooth implementation of editorial, a strong 'mountain' to safeguard the true equality of speech, prevent retaliation, left-leaning dogmatism and rightist opportunities, arbitrary or one-sided criticism, and 'ten ambush' barriers to bias, etc. The touchstone of true democracy, the source of all warmth. Careful learning of the relevant documents will make us deeply appreciate the significance of raising the problem and the great spirit of solving the problem seriously and responsibly. Anyone should not doubt what the 'cage' or the appearance of a fiction story, because the proletant does not confess contradictions, not afraid to admit mistakes. Lenin said in 1921: 'Every minute we have not forgotten our failures and mistakes in our work. Whether in the past or present, it is really a lot.' He teaches us that every leader should be very careful and humble, close contact with the masses, and consult with the masses, investigate and study the actual situation repeatedly, and often carry out appropriate criticism and self-criticism appropriate to the specific situation. Gorky's famous quote: 'standing higher in this reality' points out that often and well deal with all kinds of contradictions exist, is the right way to improve and progress. \\nBut it is undeniable that under this shining guiding light, there are still a variety of different thoughts and concerns, mainly dominated by the old ideology, using old minds to treat new things, such as the so-called 'evil from the exportation', 'words must be lost', 'words not useful' and so on., to develop the concept of 'more things than less things' and 'steady' style. In fact, it is unnecessary to embrace the purpose of 'doing good with people' and 'starting from the desire of unity'. \\n'Jiang Taigong' estimates: some comrades in leadership positions of different sizes may hear their own strange voice, instinctively vigilant, worry about 'putting' chaos, burning their eyes to maintain 'order' as their duty, they will shake their heads, even slap into fist, put up the face of the depressive defender; it is also estimated that the 'Puritans' do not recognize and not Allowing any shortcomings to exist, responsibility is strict and about broad, so the essence of the internal contradictions of the people has been repeatedly explained in policy, pointing out that socialist construction can only be accelerated by facing reality and handling correctly. Also, revealing contradictions will not only affect the motivation of the staff and undermine the prestige of the leadership, Nor is it possible to expand the state of affairs to allow people with ulterior motives to drill down, resulting in job losses. \\nAll people know effectively that this is the development of cultural science and science, and that the long-term straightforward necessary for the long term will certainly do the responsibility of a socialist builder with practical action. \\nRecent reports in newspapers show that democratic style is still poor in the political life of individual organs, even bureaucracy still dominates, and is often shocked and opposed by the ideological power of the party and the new forces in the lives of the masses, and the deep darkness still envelops: full of food and inaction The flies camp gougou, nominal status does not work, the upright under the brutal and rude style, Being marginalized, insulted, only tolerating obedience; even public and private, unclear, unfair and bittersweet. Such contradictions between the leadership and the leader, even if 'the facts themselves are not necessarily real, but a material', 'should be dissolved and the real truth of reality drawn from it' (quote Gorky's words above). Allowing development to continue will lose the superiority of the proletarian dictatorship. \\nThe revolution has embarked on a new era of history, conditions have changed and their nature changed. Failure to recognize that real life is full of contradictions, is part of the fact that it is an objective part of the fact that 'catching sparrows with closed eyes', cannot come out of the hard shell of dogmatic rigid ideology, it is inevitable to get out of the masses. \\nThose who truly care for the cause of the people will not blame Vino and a bunch of singing merit, bow down to the paternalistic leadership style without principle. They should ignore the personal gains and losses. In temporary setbacks, withstand the test, do not conceal, not hide, not hide, not overshadow, not exaggerate, do not shrink, Under the formula of unity-criticism-struggle-unity, to get the right treatment , is for due diligence. \\nBelieving that the Communist Party of China, walking with Chairman Mao, will not have to be afraid to 'play a small report' or 'make a note', nor need to ask its own 'Ming' sound rhythm like a whirlpool, and how bright and eye-catching the pattern of 'put' the color fragrance, as long as it is to remove bureaucracy, sectarianism and subjectivity, to unite everything.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached 3] Bow Bird (Nie guangchi Guangdi): '38 Women's Day celebrates the comrades of their families living apart' (1957. 2.28)\\nPina Tang before swallow, winter Tibetan summer to see, two or three brothers, Liuyan in his county \\nWho to make up? Who should blow new clothes? Master Ray, view for my group. \\nSon-in-law came from the door, oblique caussia ×, 'Fuqing and do not ×, water clear stone from now' \\nIwami Ho, go far away. \\nThe first section of this 'Yan Song Line' is the ancient words of China's ancient Han and Clarifu. It began with four sentences saying that people outside the rock do not return, not if the swallows come and go have time; clothes broken no one seams, new clothes and can not afford to do, lost far away, love care for nothing, make feel warm and friendly, can be very secure work. However, separating the two places is better than reunion, so there is the idea of 'not as good as home'. \\nFrom this poem, think of the family of most of our comrades so far apart. When our national construction flourishes, we all strive for a lofty ideals of our humanity, see our upcoming happy tomorrow, prefer to sacrifice temporary personal interests and contribute to the long-term collective interests of each individual, it is precisely with our personal interests to and the interests of our families, a meaningful manifestation of action. However, we can not deny: there are indeed many inconveniences in separating the two places, the first is, the cost of comparison between the two ends is not cost-effective; second, family arrangement, whip long, care is difficult to take care of, intangible loss is even more unspeakable; as for eating and living, pingtin exchange, can not be desired, that still life in the details; our comrades show a high level of service to the people, and they are not much better than that. \\nWhat we miss is the families who remain in their place of origin, especially women comrades (including their loved ones, mothers, mother-in-law or other non-immediate family members who help us care for our families). Because of the improvement of awareness, they get rid of their natural children, put down the starting point of private, shoulder the burden of household chores, raising the next generation, this spirit is great, their courage is praiseworthy! \\nWhen we commemorate the '38' here, we must not forget their perseverance to overcome many difficulties. We should think of the national character of Chinese women's frugal operation. If they had not managed our home for us, how many foreign officials could not live together with their girlfriends for the time being, I'm afraid it would be difficult to give full play to their motivation and manufacturing in their work!? \\nThis, of course, does not mean that all members of each family live under the same roof. This is not possible, nor does it need to be. The stereotyped family concept of feudal has long been abandoned, but before social welfare measures and new lifestyles have not been established during the transition period, no family is inevitable that some real situation needs to be specifically addressed. This is not the same as confined to the individual's small world, nor can it be It is unreasonable to say that they are implicated. \\nOrganizationally respectful of these, can be similar to the 'view for our group', conceiving that the private privacy of each person's family has noticed a series of issues related to home visits, residence, and pick up, and so on. This shows that the warmth of the revolutionary family is unspeakable. However, it may also be useful to mention in the way: instead of waiting for 'water clear stone self-insightedness', how to do it more effectively? It is only necessary to keep in touch with comrades carefully and responsibly, and think that there will be no feeling of 'Iwami Iwami', but also a kind of condolence to the distant family members. \\nThe problem shows that for a moment can not be fully achieved 'living room security', but real care can solve a large part of the emotional scorching. Conditions are not enough, after explaining the reason, and then try as much as possible; comrades with 'sincerity, golden stone is open', there is no bad discussion. As a system to do, do not suffer from widowhood unevenness, most avoid this thicker or affectionate matter of arbitrariness; unbiased, can be seen by the big duke. \\nThe spirit of women comrades working far from home is particularly admirable. As with all other women in the country, they are also actively participating in the socialist construction in the context of the basic victory of the country's socialist transformation. In their work, study and life, they can carry out hard and simple good traditions, seriously ask for progress. Not only do they arrange their families and educate their children well, but also to the solidarity and mutual assistance of all my comrades, and to inspire other comrades to pay attention to the collective, love workers Do, have been of great help. These illustrate the relationship between socialism and the complete emancipation of women and the superiority of a socialist family. \\nWe fully agree with the following points advocated by the elders and sisters and would like to wish them more and more achievements in moving forward: (i), building a sense of responsibility in the cause of socialist construction; perseverance in learning theory, policy and science and culture; diligent research into technology and business, High working capacity. \\n(ii), To protect the health and safety of women and children; to regulate childbearing appropriately, combat early marriages which are not of marriageable age, and assist schools in educating themselves in discipline. \\n(iii), The education of marriage, family and children through communist morality and the consolidation of the virtues of mutual upbringing and maintenance. Finally, according to what has already been mentioned above, I hope that I lead lesbians take care of several characteristics of their lives, pay attention to the following things:\\n(1), In lesbians, washing is a big thing in everyday life. At present, I have not provided them with a washroom, wash water had to splash in the entrance of the dormitory, not only to take water to the distance, the inside area of the dormitory, but also felt the lack of room for maneuver, washing clothes all need to be in the open air, not very convenient. If there is such a place where you can wash things inside, is it not a measure of merit? \\n(ii), Pregnant women comrades must be particularly careful about diet. Our canteens should not only take care of the nutrition of the sick comrades, but also for the antenatal care of pregnant women, design their favorite staple food and pay for food. It would be more thoughtful if nursing mothers were able to arrange their dietary needs. \\n(iii), Women would like to have a lounge where they can do hand and talk while knitting or sewing, because they have a lot of knowledge and experience and can exchange each other. The spare time, so leave their time, perhaps for the transfer of life, to restore the energy after a day of fatigue is beneficial. At the same time, because it is often possible to understand each other and enhance solidarity and friendship, thus strengthening working ties, enrich the collective and carry out some meaningful activities, which must also be favoured by trade unions. \\n(iv), Women comrades are more keen about letters sent by their loved ones or friends. This should be easily understood and understood. Now, the letters of hundreds of people are on display in the mail at the door, and can be picked up by anyone, day and night, although it is better to be distributed solemnly when nothing has happened (which may have occurred but not yet detected). Can this be done? What should I do? It was also hoped that comrades would express their views. \\nSomeone might ask: Women's affairs, want you to do nothing about it? My answer is: Gays and lesbians are only gender different, their welfare is part of the welfare of society, social welfare is related to our gay men, so we care about the common interests of society and we care about the interests of lesbians, although I am a man, I can also reflect for lesbians, for lesbians, and hope other comrades have the same thoughts as me. \\n[Published by the Office of the Leading Group of the Chinese Academy of Sciences: Collection of Right Factors of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (1), Internal Data, June 1958]\\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached four] Nie guangchi Guangdi (bow bird): 'In addition to three harm-learning one of the eight documents essays' (1957. 1.5)\\nThere is a popular story in history, which is about daring people around the Jindynasty, but not fine, so people compare him to Nanshan's white frontal tiger and the Jiao of the Long Bridge, also when he is a 'harm'. Later, Zhou is determined to be good, keep the line, and shoot the damaging tiger and plastic, since then, 'in addition to the three damage' spread down to become a thousand and ancient American talk. \\nOne of the important agendas of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China is to enable the Party to maintain correct and sound leadership in the future, and to raise a fundamental question to the Congress: how to try to reduce the misconceptions of the Party organization and its members. The main manifestations are: (i), ideological subjectivity; (ii), bureaucracy; (iii), sectarianism in the organization. \\nWe all agree that removing these three major hazards is the only key to ensuring the smooth development of the Party's work and avoiding major mistakes. \\nAll comrades admit that subjectivity is more harmful than Nanshan's tiger, but in our work and life on weekdays, is it often in careful examination of the many intangible losses caused by this problem? Just ask: Are all major issues fully conceived and discussed in the appropriate collective context? Is it not to put all objective and practical research, and then spread it out to allow unfettered controversy of different points of view? Was it comprehensively listened to and absorbed the various opinions of the outside party? Is it patient enough to consider the arguments against and criticism from the following? \\nOr? Before the question did not figure out, already stubborn stereotypes, 'arranged' a bit beforehand? Even for comrades who have the right motives and dare to make opinions, take a blow! Are there some problems with their own subjective, rumored others subjective? At the time of processing, probably because of the power of leadership authority, the masses masses muddly accepted it, but later found it inappropriate, still did not face the shortcomings, and would it go wrong? Are they simply satisfied with surface light' and do not ask for objective and practical effects of various measures? \\nChairman Liu Shaoqi taught us that in order to effectively oppose subjectivity, systematic efforts must be made to raise the level of Marxinism in our party. These sayings should serve as the motto for each of us. We want to remove the subjectivity of our ideological understanding, we must not strengthen the learning of political theory, but we should not 'hold people strictly and blame ourselves,' and 'strengthen political education' to the voices of other people, while ourselves, regardless of the performance of our work, ideology, life style, we can't see it. Learn seriously, do not see any improvement. The specific practices of revolutionary exercises and demands on the masses often appear disproportionate. \\nFrom the other side: because of the insufficient democratic atmosphere, how many people are Vino? Although a large part of it is 'Ming Zhe,' 'knowledge of time affairs, Junjie', but a few of them are completely possible and have confidence in making their own conclusions, and also take the views of the leaders as the only basis for judging their opinions correctly or not. And that who will always 'pull the flags of good wind', although it can not be calculated to please, nor must it be oral disobedience, but they always set up a clear rule for themselves: the theoretical level of the leader is high, the history of the revolution is long, and of course, the problems are all right. Why should we take their shallow insights to 'hit' and 'go ugly'? Such complacency is a serious factor contributing to the development of subjectivity as a stumbling block to progress. \\nTo avoid subjective, only deep into reality, everyone can express themselves, speak freely, fully play their role in their head, do not blindly superstition, unprincipled obedience, self-defeating, personal opinions, completely to the opinions of others as shifting, 'others in the heart of the circle, they will have to 'Turn on a big circle in the circle', this word, all considered foolproof The contagion of Jinkou Yu Yan can cause those who commit subjective problems to suffering! \\nMarxinism is not a dogma, let alone a few people have 'patented goods', should not be used mechanically, but rather be good at using its positions, views, methods to observe and solve problems in real life, if it is self-proclaimed to observe and solve problems in real life, to deal with the current The problem, then is not immune to empirical mistakes. Things are constantly developing, society continues to progress. Anyone who thinks that they have done some work in the past, will inevitably fall into the mud pit of 'pride makes people backward'. \\nThe second 'harm' that hinders the party's prestige is bureaucratic. \\nIndeed, our party is wholeheartedly serving the people. Therefore, the Party has never allowed anyone to 'be' an official, let alone no one to be a blessing in front of the masses. If a person today is 'heralded himself', and even thinks that he has had some 'hard' labor in the past, and today enjoy a little bit, it is today It is easy to be eroded by the idea of the small bourgeois, inevitably Old cadres turned into 'deterioration'. Such people do not work hard to learn new knowledge, or disconnect theoretical and practical disconnect, do not explore new business, are satisfied with a praise for the least should have a little achievement, accustomed to the 'south sitting' issuing orders, unwilling to go deeper into the masses, fully develop democracy, and carry out our Party's hard struggle, loyal to the old party A good tradition of real. \\nDiscare for the welfare of most people is also a feature of bureaucracy. \\nThose who commit such problems will inevitably emphasize the leadership 'prestige', excuses organizing and carrying out so-called 'cruel struggles and ruthless strikes' against critics, resulting in a situation of uncertainty and discouragement, causing the living forces among the masses to be mutilated, causing major losses to their work. They treat the mistakes or shortcomings of comrades, in addition to painful accusations and sharp criticism, they should never expect patience and enthusiasm to help people to convince people and speak words into the hearts of others. On the contrary, they forbid the critics from interpreting and holding a 'unconscious' hat, so that everything can think that this person can be isolated from the masses. But when the masses see that this is bureaucratic, and they understand that it is not a terrific and serious mistake, they will beg for a struggles meeting criticism. In fact, many things that can be avoided from detours can be understood by just a few words of Kirov; Kirov used to portray the criticism of the Communist Party, and he paints and exhorts those who always hold the view of 'helping people ends with help at meetings', saying:\\n'Honestly, follow the Bolshevik approach, look straight into the eyes of comrades and communists, and say to him: You, dear man, you have been stumbled and stuck, and if you can't get up, I'll help you. If you do not pull your hand up, I will pull your hair and I will do everything possible to correct you.' \\nYes, that attitude should be the basis of friendship between any of us. 'Do everything possible' is not equal to saying that in addition to expressing anger and enthusiasm at the meeting, but do nothing after the meeting, to talk about the shortcomings of the family, and even 'throwing down the stone' to 'wall down', this can not be said to be a real grief or concern! \\nBureaucrats tend to punish others as a step to raise their own price, blessed with other people's thoughts and burdens, but they are never willing to accept the advice or criticism of others. Their mantra is:\\n'Your opinion is good, we can refer to; your criticism is faithful and I accept it.' \\nOh my God! In the depths of their minds, how to taste 'reference'? How to 'accept'? Not to adhere to their own 'principles'. To change it, that can't! \\nThe explicit manifestation of bureaucracy is that 'this is the system' to scare people, wherever they can go up and down their hands, do not take this magic weapon out of prevarication or show that their power is in control. \\nThe third biggest 'harm' is sectarianism. It is totally unsuitable for our party's line of 'starting from the best interests of the widest people'. However, there are communists who regard the great revolutionary cause led by the Party as a few things. They always do not believe in others, underestimate the consciousness and role of the masses, and even adopt a kind of clear-cut closure, forgetting the obligation of communists to cooperate only with people outside the party, and absolutely have no right to exclude them Leigh. Part of the party members, to transform the others themselves, a mention of the 'masses', always say 'backward' in a scoring mockery tone. This kind of self-arrogance did create a divide between the parties and weaken the unity within the revolutionary team. \\nSectarianism also manifests itself in the reluctance of party members to approach the masses, old relationships, old folks pulling each other, and the formation of a barrel-type front with a strong wall of Kiyono. Anyone who dared to teach their subjective ideas or ideas, methods, and criticized them, that is, 'the speakers are guilty' and light Easy to give a 'liberal' hat, if no more rapids retreat, then add 'no Organisational, undisciplined, 'against leadership', 'undermining the authority of superiors'. How many outspoken people have eaten this dumb loss over the years? How many of them have been flattened, but only no in the event, but the fear of sin? Such a person who is faithful and unheard, and does not hear and do not hear the voices of the masses, the problems are heavier. \\nTherefore, while opposing subjectivity, this sectarianism, which is not in line with the revolution, must be reversed together! \\nThere is a kind of communist people who 'respect' the powers of extra-party personnel, and can also exercise 'collective' leadership in administration with extra-party personnel. At business meetings, they speak in series, put forward preliminary opinions, and do not hesitate to explain to the comrades who challenge them in detail, then explain them, and, if necessary, hinder This is the intention of the superior, so everyone withdrew their views and passed the draft bill. Or, when you reach out to the masses, there are a lot of opinions to them, they will say to these 'unspeakable and endless' comrades: 'You still convince the masses, this is not a few of our claims, this is the decision of the collective leadership.' Or simply come to a 'ignore it accordingly' and 'don't care about it!' \\nIf the main contradiction in our current society is only a kind of conflict between 'advanced' and 'backward', then the policy of 'one hundred families contending' and 'mutual supervision' is twelve necessary, timely and difficult tasks. However, it will not be possible to achieve success if we are to make a difference within the entire family of the revolution and help each other without removing the scourge of sectarianism. \\nThe 'three harm' mentioned above is what I learned in the eight major documents that I learned to the current political path, from the negative side, must pay close attention to prevent and stop it. The proposals for the construction of the positive aspects of the document are very thorough and very clear, and should continue to study well. This article is purely theoretically published some personal experience, period with everyone. \\nComrades! Let's put sectarianism around! He corrected his own mistakes around, and then perished for the people. Only by quitting these three major 'harm' can work and live together happily and happily, united and fraternally for the construction of socialism, and contribute our own best strength.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attachment Five】Nie guangchi Guangdi: 'Write to the comrades who love me' (1957.7.7)\\nCountering the right is a sharp and fierce ideological struggle for you, and for a person like me, it can also be said that there is a political struggle. For more than a dozen days, you have uncovered many questions about me, and I'm checking the confession. Since I focused my time and energy on reflection, I did not have the opportunity to talk to you about my thoughts, please help me analyze criticism, and do not understand your own knowledge of sport? Allow me to tell you about my personal experience through the Blackboard newspaper. \\nWhat I want to say is not a set of theories, but a shallow analogy:\\nThere is a man who married four times: the first time she married a foreign woman, changed the rules of his family, things have to follow her opinion, make this man mentally decadent, read eight articles at home every day, smoke opium, do not work, and she? One day to late to take demand, need to squander, just enjoy yourself. In this way, on the one hand, he had nothing to do with production, on the one hand, spent indiscriminately, and finally his family had lost his wealth, and people were dying. \\nIt's easy to leave this foreign woman and married a woman from the north, but it is a barren woman who fights today, tomorrow fights, and makes trouble with his family. His hard work earned a few sweaty money, could not afford her a search and two scratches, but also made dry and quiet. So how many years of hardship left to marry again. According to this time, is it okay? Do you know great or worse! Why? Because this woman is a 'lady of thousands of gold' who is rich and honoured, but also made a good friend, her friend is honest and honest, very reasoned, and she is deeply rooted, betrayed this friend and restored her original face. So, when this man marries her, it's not her friend persuaded to help her to learn well and wanted to go up. \\nNeedless to say, what is the good outcome of marrying such a wife? Not only did he sell for light, but also whispered, suffering extraordinary, neighbours saw him insane, often bully him, and made him a fine light, and he himself became like a poor worm. Finally, the 'broom star' was driven out, and he remembered his healthy and lovely girlfriend. \\nOut of his own choice, he came to the conclusion from the painful lessons of the past three times, that: a lifelong event is not a child play. To start a family and be a good man, a good wife, a smart and fruitful housewife, must be a wise and fruitful housewife to help him run his home. So he decided to marry the woman who had a good knowledge and good character. Life after marriage is very happy, their families have been supported, bought production, added all necessary appliances, not only can work well, earn enough money, but also increase their knowledge. She was totally unblamed and regarded me as a man who married for the first time and worked hard to do household chores. Thanks to her well managed, their home is the happiest, richest, and brightest. Neighbors no longer dare to see their homes secretly. \\nBut men are men after all. They went on the street and occasionally met a fancy woman like his ex-wife, and he could not avoid looking a few more eyes, and even praised the woman's beauty to his lover, or she was not as good as that woman. His beloved listened angry, and he must have quarrel with him. Once a little noisy could not work, the second time he found his family to argue, no longer, and to join her family together, the aim is to make the truth clear. No matter how many people or small, it is simply to solve problems within the family. However, in the debate, she is the most sensible, and she knows how to solve such a problem, so, regardless of the one who speaks, a few words from his head, the person who can hear the speech is standing on that side and is standing on her side? Or is it on the side of her husband's irregularities? There is no doubt that if a third party is to help her husband's misconceptions speak, she must refute it, even that this person is secretly contributing to the development of her husband's thinking. If the agreement of the third party is to correct his attitude and to make him truly understand the meaning of starting a family, not only for themselves, but also for the sake of children and generations, then this argument is not only what she welcomes, but also what he should listen to, which other family members have nothing to do. The exception was agreed. \\n× × × ×\\nFrom this parable above, we can get the following revelations:\\n(1), The man had enough food for foreign women (imperialism), the northern woman (feudalism), and 'Miss Qianjin' (bureaucratic capitalism), and later he married a good wife with reputation and unanimously admitted. The facts also proved his love since the marriage to the woman. It's a lot better. His home is not only like a man, but also more than many others. The family is fuller and happier. As long as he is a person who understands good or bad, a bit of human nature, he should never have three or two thoughts and opinions. Even if he does not have such a heart, he should not even turn around because what he needs is a healthy, thriving coexistence, not the kind of inhuman life of the past. \\n(2), If you say this way, can it be said that there is no oblique in a person's mind? A wife who often reminds these things, in order not to allow such oblivion to develop, is it kindness? Or is it simply because of the volume of narrowness, jealousy? Shouldn't she be 'noisy' for the sake of their home, for the sake of the future generation? And if he were to be a popline, in the midst of three and twilight, that did not put her husband in the heart, she would have nothing to do, let himself go. Imagine who was the last loss? Therefore, it is certain that putting the issue up and talking clearly is out of love, caring and genuine common starting point. \\n(iii), The choice of one's own personal experience and through the legal formalities established by the Marriage Act, proves that it is a family formed by mutual interest, of course, with the consent of the entire family. Who should care about problems in his family, who may have the same thing happening. In order to hope that the combination of both of them is consolidated, you can also associate yourself with a place to shake? When the woman asks this question to test the will of the man, if the man is sincerely, first check the wrong degree of his mind. In this way, their shortcomings can be addressed and acknowledged and corrected in a timely manner. If the man argue that he just looked at the woman and did not turn his mind. Or even to say that he did not pursue her; it would be difficult for the woman to point out his mistakes, and even if he did so, would not necessarily bring the man to plead from the bottom of his heart. As for the third party? Even more should not refuel from the side of the fire, irresponsibly say what this is 'rivers and mountains easy to change', 'nature is difficult to move', although it is a big mistake, if he has not taken actual action, it can't be mistaken, then it is a big mistake, because what the woman attaches is not that he has always determined, but to prevent it. To stop the growth of this kind of activity, because a man can't recognize his great premise to marry a family, then, Even if it is his wife, faithful, he will change his heart, do not think that a little small phenomenon does not matter. From this little phenomenon you can conclude that there is a source of thought inside him. If allowed to develop, it will certainly lead to his abandonment of her in the future, the so-called 'home flowers do not have wild flower fragrance', a good end put a media is marrying, is sure to help him establish a family business, the most ideal lady do not, he will go to find A prostitute, a 'loser' who killed his family. The third party should not stand idly by, should understand some of his ugly nature, and if there is an unspeakable act he carried on her back, it should be revealed in a timely manner. This is not called 'sabotage' the 'feelings' of the husband and wife, but to be realistic in order to make him fully aware of his own mistakes, so that they combine them. In order to truly consolidate it, any idea of concealing shelter would be detrimental to him and to the detriment of their family. She (socialist), is a bright and unselfish woman. Any man who marries her only one will, and any evil thoughts must be eradicated without reservation. \\n(4), No one of us wants to go dead. It is a blessing to get away from the three bad women, and now to marry such a perfect good woman is not enough? There are also three intentions to stay with the 'Jin Yu, the defeat among them'? Still not clear this is the best only destination? Everyone in this family should have the same belief that taking this path, rather than another dead end, can lead us to the path of disname. This man's wife and he 'noisy' is a natural and righteous thing, it is a human affair, and there is no slightest bad intentions. As long as he really feels her good and has generated feelings, it is never thought that this is a choice of people, and will appreciate this is necessary, that he himself has a great benefit \\n× × ×\\nSo, as a party to the problem itself, I feel the urgent need to treat this anti-right struggle, whether it is just a little bit of the sprout of thought, the girlfriend (especially the jeweled female rogue, capitalism), should be dig out of the mind. The essence of one's words and deeds; for that reason, I ask every one to be concerned Or a comrade who loves me, can continue to point out my mistakes, expose my facts, not so, our combination is not consolidated, will be shaken, then, development, the future will be unimaginable! \\nStand on that side? Please put this question mark into my ear often. This time, everyone's help to me is incalculable. I promise that I will treasure these criticisms and opinions, and I will not learn the obsessed man, to thoroughly reinvent my mind. Although I have written an initial examination of nearly 670,000 words, it is just about many of the questions that you have ordered me to deal with, indicate some of the circumstances to be explained, and spread out first, so that you can help me to make further analysis and criticism, but this information is still not enough, and we need you to have a solid position to follow Continued expose. I am here to ask you sincerely, hoping that I can really lose my thought burden, and from now on, under the education of our Party, gradually set up a revolutionary optimistic view of life and firm my own working-class position! \\nBy the way, thank you very much for your help!

Almost every household has been copied over a dozen times. In fact, after the 'return' of 1961, Nie guangchi's family has not had much inventory, but people do not believe that you such a big boss of Nie guangchi's family, how could you have no money? So a group of people came, turn the cabinet down, dig wall feet, pry the floor, demolish the stairs, even the children's hand cloth toys, also to use a needle to see if there is gold...\\nZhou Ren, Nie guangchi Qibi's home was copied for a whole week, everything was pulled by trucks, and the paper with words in the home can be said to be a piece of paper. Mr. Zhou Ren was in his 70s, somehow accused of being associated with what 'Plum Blossom Party'. He is a scholar and a metallurgical expert. He also became a 'illegal capitalist' only because he hosted steel mills invested by Sheng Shengyi and Liu Hongsheng in Kunming during the war of resistance. He was ill and was not treated, causing one eye to be blind, broken another leg and received no medical treatment, and could only lie in bed. However, lying on a bed was also subject to isolation, and was then placed in a four-walled, windowless room, tortured to death in 1973. \\nNie guangchi Guangyong's home was copied 5 days and five nights. When he was copied for the first time, the villains found a holster of a pistol, so thought that a major clue had been found, according to the logic at that time, there must be a gun, there must be a second gun with the first robbed, this house must be concealed weapons, ready to account for the future autumn. So he made great efforts to isolate all the family and not be allowed to speak. They worked for five days, walls, floors, stairs all turned over, but even the shadow of the pistol did not, but the home had been stabbed, only the floor slab did not collapse. In fact, the holster is a small pistol played before the liberation of Nie guangchi Guangyong. It was bought with invoices and certificates. When the country collected weapons in the early days of liberation, he was handed over to the national public security department. He left a set for commemoration. Who knows to have caused such a great deal! After copying home wages are stopped, only living expenses, 13 yuan per person. Nie guangchi Guangyong couple has a daughter and one child, a month of 39 yuan, and his wife Yu Weili 74 yuan pay only $24. This standard of living continued from 1966 to 1972. \\nNie guangchi Guangyao's home has not been copied several times. Anyway, as long as someone with a red armband comes in, you will have to let him copy. The home seems to be a public place where anyone can come in at will. One day came a few bad guys, impersonating villains to copy their homes, and see if there was really nothing to copy at home, he took Nie guangchi Guangyao's watch away. Nie guangchi's family, who has long been a bird of surprise, has completely lost the security barrier, and even the consciousness of self-defense is not allowed. Their children are also discriminated against in school and are often abused and beaten. When the villains rushed into Nie guangchi Guangda's family, it happened that he was not home, dragged his 70-year-old mother Li Jingxuan out and criticized. The old man's family is small feet, standing on the table and unstable, and the villains add up on her feet. Back home at night, the old man critically asked her granddaughter, 'Why are they fighting me?' 'They said Nie guangchi's family opened factories and exploited workers,' said granddaughter Nie guangchi Chongwei. The elderly still do not understand: 'If you don't open a factory, there is no work for workers who want to be unemployed and have no meals, what is wrong with opening a factory?' The granddaughter was still small and could not answer this very simple question that had become extremely complex at that time. Li Jingxuan is a nine-lady of Governor Li Hanzhang (Li Hongzhang's brother), of late Qing Huguang, with a cheerful mind and a good letter. Before the war of resistance, only eight children and more than forty boxes went to Hunan for refuge, leaving a will to ask for sea burial before her death. At that time she was a 96-year-old man. \\nRen Yonggong is Nie guangchi Guangqi's wife, only because she worked in the Municipal Authority Authority. In the 5'60s, Liu Shaoqi, Wang Guangmei and Luo Ruiqing and Comrades Hao Zhiping worked in Shanghai before leaving the country. The leaders asked her to accompany Wang Guangmei and Hao Zhiping to see clothing, finding tailors, with lace, and became a big problem in the Cultural Revolution. Quarantine review for several years, and her daughter was only 9 years old, feeding mom every day... \\nLife And Death Online\\nNie guangchi Chongzhi had fallen into trouble before the Cultural Revolution. When he was studying at Tsinghua University, he went home for a summer vacation, and talked to his classmates on the train about the current toothpaste is not good, the toothpaste in the past is easy to use, brushed clean, when the right was exposed, became a right-wing speech, attacking socialism, and so on. At that time, there were targets for college students to draw the right, and every school must be completed. As a result, Nie guangchi Chongzhi unfortunately won the bid, became the right, and he was sent to the Beijing switch factory for labor without completion of his studies. At the same time, hundreds of university students have been allocated labor. A year later, people offered to deport them to the Great Northwest, but were stopped by Comrade Peng Zhen (then Mayor of Beijing). Comrade Peng Zhen knows that these people are academic tips, very smart, and can be handy to stay in Beijing. And he also knew that those 'right-wing speech' were all things that had been known for some days. So they stayed in the factory all the time. Factory is the most practical place, whoever has technology, who can do it, who has the actual 'weight'. Nie guangchi Chongzhi, with his wisdom and perseverance, quickly became a technical innovator and won the love of a girl. The whole family of three generations red, root red and miao zheng, her family does not agree to this marriage anyway, and the girl does not marry Nie guangchi Chongzhi, preferring to sever contacts with her family. The girl finally became his lady. It is said that wearing a 'right' hat can still 'pick the hat', but there is a premise that mistakes must be admitted seriously. Of course, people on the right are striving to 'pick up the hat' and get spiritual liberation at an early date. However, Nie guangchi Chongzhi's work is silent and buried hard, and 'politically' is not actively 'demanding progress'. The factory leader kindly advised him: quickly acknowledged the wrong, picked up the hat, even if it passed, can be a bright man in the future, but Nie guangchi Chongzhi like head cattle, something else is good to say, that I'm wrong, no door! Therefore, his 'hat' was not corrected until after the Cultural Revolution, when the country reviewed the anti-right issue in a unified manner, and the university diploma was also obtained after the 'Cultural Revolution'. Now become a well-known switch technology expert. \\nNie guangchi Chongzhi still met a good leader, and Nie guangchi Guangdi was in trouble. He works in a research department in Beijing and is classified as the right. His main right-wing speech is said to be a 'If a lover will finally be a family member', an article calling for a couple separated from the two places, but in fact has to do with family origin and studying at Yanjing University and Harvard University in the United States. He was more thought to be 'bad attitude' and then imprisoned, and finally died in prison. \\nNie guangchi Guangda is a animal husbandry expert of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences. In order to cultivate excellent breeds of cows and pigs, he has traveled in Chongming and rural Shanghai counties for many years. The results obtained have been recognized by the General Administration of Agriculture Reclamation of the Ministry of Agriculture. He also held a national farm site meeting to introduce his experience. However, in the Cultural Revolution, I don't know how so many 'problems' will come up at once, and they have been quarantined for two years, and families are not allowed to visit. It was not released until a month after Lin Biao exploded himself. On that day, the Academy of Agricultural Sciences held a general meeting and declared that he 'had a reason for the incident and found no evidence, and therefore withdrew the quarantine review'. Because he lived a life of complete isolation from the world, he did not know anything about Lin Biao. So according to the usual practice at that time, he shouted: 'Long live Chairman Mao! Vice Chairman Lin in good health!' Cause a burst of laughter under the stage...\\nPeople who had been quarantined for nearly two years were elected as deputies to the Eighth Municipal People's Congress in 1983, let alone when the 1988 NPC changed, he was also recommended by the Organizational Department of the Municipal Committee for election as a member of the Ninth Municipal People's Congress and Finance Committee. \\nIn the Cultural Revolution, there were several other people killed by the persecution of Nie guangchi's family. Jiufang's son-in-law Qu Duizhi, is Nie guangchi Qu Qipu's husband, famous writer, son of former Minister of Military Affairs Qu Hongqi, expert in classical literature research, life works of great abundance, mainly 'People and Customs Congregation', 'Introduction to Chinese Mania', 'Fang Zhi Examination', 'Wang Hui Zu', 'Li Baizu School' Notes, 'Liu Yuxi Collection Notes', 'Moratorium and Room essays', 'Lo Telling', etc. In the Cultural Revolution, one of his former students was bitten indiscriminately during quarantine censorship, revealing that he had attacks on Jiang Qing, which resulted in an ongoing counter-revolution, in 1973. \\nThe youth of a chong descendant, because they were framed and criticized, they really couldn't eat, and died suicide. \\nThe most tragic thing is that the daughter of four rooms, Nie guangchi Guangxi, on the train from Jinan to Shanghai, was actually killed alive by the 'South Lower Corps' of the Red Guards in Beijing with a copper head belt...\\nThree old trees in the cold wind\\nIn the summer of 1994, a poster of Chinese painting appeared on the streets of Brussels, the Belgian capital. Dark clouds on the poster, cold wind whistling, a dark earth, standing three dead branches old trees, supporting each other, under the Chinese Nie guangchi's brothers joint art exhibition. When people walked into the showroom, the three brothers were not old men, but three living tiger middle-aged people. However, their personal character has been hammered like an old tree. They are Nie guangchi Chongyong, Nie guangchi Chongping, Nie guangchi Chongliang. \\nNie guangchi Chongyong is the boss, who was a worker in the factory, because all the samples performed well, and the amateur also did cultural propaganda for the factory, and the organizational department was ready to develop him into the party. But when people turned over his file and found that he was Nie guangchi's family, he had serious problems with his origin, and said to him, 'You didn't play, draw your paintings!' He really likes painting from childhood, especially pets, puppies, kittens and birds, to a spiritual one under his pen. A few decades later, he won a gold medal at a European painting exhibition, drawing a cat, but he took most of his life to the cat. \\nWoe from the Cultural Revolution. At a factory-wide conference, he was suddenly pulled into the first detention centre at the station road, and more than a dozen people squeezed a cell No. 15, which had two more unbridled 'live treasures', one was Wang Rowang and one was Yu Duff's nephew with the excitement. We began to be very heroic, the sea and sky chat, take turns to tell stories, jokes. Wang Ruowang asserted that 'Xiao Nie guangchi certainly will not be released long.' Well, one day he was called out and said he went back to the factory to see the material. But when he really faced his 'material', people suddenly frightened, and he was sentenced to seven years for the current counter-revolution. When he returned to the First Detention Centre, he was no longer eligible to return to cell 15 and was kept alone in room 16. He wanted to tell his own situation to his partner next door, but between the two chambers there was only an intentional small hole in the toilet. And he was lying in the hole and called upon the people of that head. When room 15 people heard of his news, they immediately died and could not laugh again. At that time, his son was only five months, and his young wife was holding his child every day to find a work team, and Central asked to see her husband... He later spent 10 years at the basket bridge, because he performed well as the prisoner's large group leader. He said to the author: 'I have never been an official in my life, but I was an 'officer' at the basket bridge.' \\nNie guangchi Chongliang, in his 50s, has two career as 'counter-revolutionary'. For the first time in the era of the Great Leap Forging, he was 16 years old, and he was a forger in a factory with the support army south of Fujian. Who knows that in an accidental incident, he became a counter-revolution overnight, and was transferred to the deep mountains of northern Fujian for logging kilns. In the days of loss of freedom, the painting became the only spiritual comfort. He was disobedient and unable to endure inhumane discrimination and torment. On a dark night, he secretly climbed the train on the north and returned to Shanghai, and lived in hiding in Tibet in the east. Many years later, they were rehabilitative. \\nIn 1963, he was 21 years old, and he could not be fed forever, so he left Shanghai again and went to more distant Xinjiang, to become a soldier of the Xinjiang construction corps, put sheep, dig canal, firewood, farm, work is not terrible, and at the end of the desert, there is a pristine landscape unimaginable by inland people, Tang Poetry The magnificent scene of the 'desert solitary smoke straight, long river sunset yen' So, that's a great opportunity to sketch and create. Who knows the good view is not long, the Cultural Revolution began, he became a counter-revolutionary for the second time, together with more than 30 other people in cachots... 8 years in prison, with endless suffering. Later, he was sent to re-employment. When he repeats the most primitive labor of mankind, God opened the window of art for him. \\nIn summer, he squat in the wheat field, a long wind blowing, heavy wheat wave ups and downs, raised a rustle, like a flaming color tumbling in the wind... Playing adobe is a heavy and monotonous job, when he mechanically repeats the way of survival of the ancestors, the mind is trembled again, several Years later, his 'Cowman' won Silver Award at the European International Exhibition of Modern Art ; 'Billet Man' and 'Spring', won the Golden Rooster Award and Bronze Award at the European Ottgen Cultural Center International Art Exhibition. \\nNie guangchi Chongping is also a 'counter-revolution', and the Cultural Revolution supervises labor in units for 10 years. His appearance is quite 'Hunan flavor', known as 'horse face'. In fact, he is not only appearance, character is also quite Xiangjun style, bold, adventurous, love hunting, as if he was not afraid of things. During the 3-year 'natural disaster' period, he always likes to go to the country on the cold winter night to hit birds, take up a gun, drive dozens of miles, sometimes with a partner, brother, most of him go out alone. The bamboo forest is frozen into a group of sparrows, knocked off one, and the rest do not know to fly away, more to shrink together, come down overnight, dozens less, more hundreds. Every time he triumphed, he always had the feeling of a European medieval knight. \\nBirds are connoisseurs, while working is not. In 1989, he enrolled in the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Belgium, relying on part-time work to sustain life and education. He paints and punches the birds very much, and the kitchen is slow. The European restaurant's decoration, color, people's clothing, jewelry styles, all left the heart, so that the boss did not like him, often done in the morning only half a day, in the afternoon was fired 'squid'. He said he was not lazy, but he was not good. \\nOne day he moved his work to the streets, actually came to buy a lot of people, can make good prices. He won't be happy, no longer need to go to a restaurant to work, can draw and draw. He completed his studies in Belgium and came to New York to work, capture, and rumble in the world of free artists. \\nHis paintings are also in the west, the Oriental art language into the modern atmosphere of the West, the ancient Chinese traditional concept, art and dialogue with the Western world, so he has the 'Sunset Heart', the spirit of personality of the deserted era. \\nLater, his paintings continue to win and sell better and better. He also launched the paintings of two brothers far away from Shanghai and held a joint painting exhibition of Nie guangchi's Brothers. When designing the poster, he tried hard to think: our three brothers, ah, now finally looked up, like what? Oh, with! That is the three old trees in the cold wind, all in the vicissitudes!

It was revealed that he used the opportunity to help the party to rectify the wind, openly defended criminals carrying out counter-revolutionary activities in religious cloak, and also slandered 'land reform', 'three contrasts' and 'rebellion' political movements 'mistaken'. After he inspected the anti-revolt work as a representative of the people of Tianjin city, he actually wanted to turn the case on behalf of the counter-revolutionaries, saying: 'The case of Catholics is not a political issue, it is a matter of materialism and mentalism', and outright that 'those sentenced to ten years and 20 years in prison should be acquitted today.' Not only did he direct his little silly at Tianjin Normal College and posted many of the large print of the Communist Party, but also publicly at the Catholic and Christian Youth Association, inciting young people to grievance with the party. Before he went to Beijing to attend a meeting of Chinese Catholic representatives, he searched around Tianjin for opposition to the Communist Party, and tried to defend the anti-revolutionary organization 'Notre Dame Army' and propose the release of the counter-revolutionary Gong Pinmei. \\nGao Qingchen is a standing member of the Association for the Promotion of Catholic Patriotic Movement in Tianjin. He and Nie guoping used an influential journal within the Catholic Church to incite people to attack the Communist Party. He has openly suggested that 'private ownership is better than public ownership, and the church should advocate private ownership'. In order to confuse the believers, Gao Qingchen's reactionary remarks spread on the 'widely publicized' were painted with religious colors. In his reactionary poem 'I want kindness, not sacrifice', he abused the Communist Party in a vague tone and said, 'If you just declare that you love me that you don't see, but don't care at all about tens of thousands of people My portraits; instead constantly sucking blood from them to me, you think, how can I please your offering-On your when?' Gao Qingchen's reactionary activities became more rampant after right-wing elements rampant to attack the party. He sent dozens of letters to 'widely publicized' correspondents asking them to reflect 'dissatisfaction with the party.' When he heard some of the youths expressed some dissatisfaction with the party at the Tianjin Youth Congress, he went all day long to visit young people to gather remarks about the party's dissatisfaction with the party written 'The controversy of Tianjin's youth friends' was published in 'Guangzhang'. He was enchanted about the fallacy of 'the party world' of Chu Anping; when he saw Ge Pei Qi's clamor of 'killing the Communist Party,' he said, 'Very pertinent, not to avoid the complications of his When Chen Jianchen, a representative of the CPPCC, wrote an article in the newspaper 'indignation and questioning Chuanping', Gao immediately wrote a essay, 'Why should I be outraged' to justify the issue. \\nIt is revealed that the two right-wing elements, Nie guoping and Gao Qingchen, are all the minions of imperialism that have always been anti-Communist and anti-people. Nie guoping was born from buying a bourgeois family. During the anti-Japanese war, Zeng Bai had traitors doing a speculative business. After his surrender, Japanese Kou joined the reactionist Du Fuxiang's door, and organized a miscellaneous army to serve as 'Lieutenant Colonel Secretary', and later relinquished the Catholic reactionary head Yu Bin to preside over the 'Catholic Cultural Association' in Tianjin. Hundreds of members have been developed to become accomplices to the counter-revolutionary activities of imperialists within the Catholic Church. Gao Qingchen Landlord was born from his family and served as head of the Organization Department of the Pseudo-New People's Association during the anti-Japanese war. After the surrender of Nikko, a reporter of the reactionary newspaper 'Yissei newspaper', and was also the manager of the 'forward forward' news agency run by Liao Yao-xiang, chief of the KMT's new six army army officers. He had collaborated with KMT agents to trap the Communist Party underground staff He was arrested by the People's Government after liberation and sentenced to two years in prison, and was very hostile to the Communist Party."}

Renegade. Now the city monopoly company is the director. Its main reactionary argument is: (1), 'gentlemen and not party'. We believe that the parties in history are separated from the masses. The Communist Party of China is unlikely to take the masses line; (2), 'ways of faithful forgiveness'.

The Party took the mass line that it was not possible. At the beginning of liberation, I thought that 'the Communist Party is an unselfless party and may walk the masses line'. Now, in recent years, the fact is that 'the Communist Party also has some 'selfless', so that many of the masses route are like walking through the costumes.' \\nThe idiom says: 'Party is the same,' 'the same nostrils go out.' From the facts of recent years, it is that many members of the Communist Party, and even a number of policy measures of the Party, this performance is not without, not less, but a lot. Many party members do not have their heads and complicity. Finding shortcomings errors is not to find party members but used to find the masses (find the masses for shortcomings errors. Criticism of education is not wrong, but it is not right for party members). From many problems (see), party members believe that only the masses are wrong, no party members are wrong. On the contrary, there are no members of the party, no masses right, 'Party members who are not not not in the world' (for the masses), ask party members leaders to check their heads and comrades. I found out. Not specific examples, I remember one more impressed: in the autumn of 1955, Comrade Wang Quanbin listened to Comrade Ru Qian to reflect what a problem in the sand area and accounting department, hard not let me say, Wang or exercise is better, I think it is a matter of political education principles of the Party. Wang and Ru are party members. I am masses. \\nThe national history of our country is to love the 'king' road (with German service), does not love 'Pa' (with force pressure), the ancients said, 'What can one?' Say: do not want to kill (do not love the whole person. One can be one of the people who can accommodate people and things.' 'Who can with it?' Say: 'The world is not with him!' (This also leads international peace policies in socialist countries). But I look at the leadership of the party in recent years-through many party members, the leadership style of many party members has used 'hegemony to press people', and less with 'Wang Road'. Performance 'amazing', 'mouth blown smallpox, the actual situation is unimaginable', such as monopoly wine patent thick. In 1955 dry wine downgrade (57 degrees to 50), no price reduction, there is no reason, the country accumulates unscrupulous means. It should be said of 'the exploitation of the people by the State', that is, 'the exploitation of the people by the party'. The ancients said that 'people do not believe it', and the work of 'Lixin' in recent years has been very poor. Many things are changed, and the name is 'adapting to the objective situation', 'to treat the problem with a dialectical materiality point of view'. I think it is an excuse to move dogma and excuse. The reactionary group of Chiang Kai-shek therefore lost the hearts and minds of the people, most notably because the four families squeezed exploitation, 'to say good words and do all bad things', such as the 1947 Song Zi Wenchang Administration's 'Gold Exchange Rate Degradation Case: That is, a significant example, the economic collapse and inability to clean up. Compared with communism of the Communist Party. The state and the government should respect the 'people's letter', saying that there is no difference between China and foreign countries in ancient times. \\nIntellectuals (large, medium or small), although not the majority of the population, have played a considerable leading role in the democratic and socialist revolution and the cause of construction. It has a representative role in terms of constituting historical nationalities. Intellectuals are always called 'taxis', 'without constant production and perseverance as a causant' (the narrator is engaged in political, economic, cultural and other activities for the nation), 'taxie for the self-knowledge, the death of the taxie for the self' (the affection of the warrior), 'taxie can kill not humiliate' (narrator), (The manpower). But the party leadership-through the leadership of its members-paid insufficient attention to the identity of intellectuals. Especially despise the so-called 'old' intellectuals. Many facts are intriguing. The party's leadership philosophy is: to quickly cultivate socialist intellectuals, crowd out old intellectuals. On any occasion, middle-aged and old intellectuals are disregarded (with party nationality are naturally different and different, old party members than non-old party members Off the fire). \\nI have some personal feelings (can I count intellectuals, at least if the goods are not a problem): I have been a typical critique for several years (radio, wall, etc.), many times. The specific things are not clear. But recollecting not once was a personal question. If it was a party member, even a personal problem had never been exposed to the public. To do this, it only educates the masses, but favors and condones party members. Contribute to party members pride. My leaders and I can't say anything about accounting business issues, sometimes because of responsibility, or as far as they argue. Honestly, it is inevitable that this leads to dissatisfaction (Southwest Company and original city companies are most impressed). Think we are people who are poorly organized and disciplined and not too tamed enough. I now recall that what I say or argue about has never touched on personal issues-only to illustrate the leadership of the party in recent years, through the style of party leadership by taming unconditional obedience. Choking human thought wisdom. Party members join the party and promote cadres almost all obedience as the main aspect of Hengde's standards. I think this is a very small question of the style of the party. From my post after liberation (IRS 1950 Southwest Military Commission Liu Bo gave the letter of appointment' as deputy director of the municipal bureau. (Divide the current position), reflecting the Party's 'downhill line' against the so-called old intellectuals, and the 'uphill line' of the party's young adults (should state: I never raised this question for specific ideas for my fame. (From the specific nature of our talent to the organization has been generous enough.), New teachers in secondary and high schools lead old professors. A lot of 'the old, the elderly (refers to the masses), useless too!' I think it's too biased. I also talked about minor issues. When I was in the Tax Office, every time I scored entertainment gifts, it was always one or second class worse than the party members of the same class. I did not cultivate, and several times I could not resist my anger tear it. \\nOur nation has the words 'loyal' and 'forgiveness' in the personal test: I think that loyalty is not only useful for feudal societies, but also socialist society is also useful, can also be said to be material rather than conscientious philosophical ideas. Now 'loyal' is to work diligently and diligently for socialist construction. But looking at these years, many non-party masses have done it. On the contrary, the Communist Party members have a lot of futility, such as comrades of our party members, rarely humbly learn to engage in practical energy work. □ Comrade said: 'The party has approved me to join the party, and is about to raise section chief.' □ The Chief of the Section moved to the work of organizing and rationalizing the technical competition and rationalization proposals, first of all proposed to cancel the competition with the business. I said it played a great role in accounting work. He continues to advocate for it to be allowed. No more awards can be given. □ It is ridiculous that the Chief of the Section asked me to make a 'ideological report' with him (the political ideology and business are quite apart). It is horrible enough to summarize the development trend of the Party's leadership evolution into party members' desire to lead. Loyal, can also be said to play an exemplary role in all aspects of work, learning, thinking, life and other aspects. This is a privileged role for many communists. The ideological behavior of superior people has reached a very general and serious level. The Kuomintang should be compared to the era of regime in the Kuomintang. The Kuomintang is the first to be worse on it, gradually spreading generally bad. Now the Communist Party is bad at the bottom... the party members seem 'amazing'! Educate people, leaders. \\nTo say 'forgiveness', the ancients said: 'Do not apply to others,' 'Do not want to be imposed on others', 'I do not want to add to me,' that is, pushing yourself and people to think about them. I think party members lead various democratic reforms, ideological transformation and 'three counter-sans', 'five counter' and 'anti-counter' movements, very much. There is a lack of 'forgiveness' thinking experience in many places. The so-called 'forgiveness' is not an argument that claims a conservative right leaning in the event. You can do 'forgiveness' to treat the problem fairly and deal with the problem fairly, it can be relatively less than corrective, less mistakes and shortcomings. \\nWe can all recall the era of the Kuomintang regime, after Chiang Kai-shek's public reactionary, to prevent framing everything, and the result was dispersed and the reactionary regime collapsed. Of course, the nature of the people's government's regime cannot be compared to Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime, but the ruling method, China has been able to reduce the punishment and clear and light tax books of all times, the ordinary people live in peace and work, and celebrate the peace of the world, otherwise it is the opposite. Such as Chu Han, xiangyu self-bullying, narrow, more suspicion, even a hero assistant Fan Zeng can not be allowed to work with. Liu Bang more open, entry only about three chapters. So Liu Cheng lost. Such examples, many in history, are now different. There is politics of the party, not the politics of the nontheistic people, but it is not very different in practice. \\nChina is engaged in socialism on the basis of semi-feudal semi-colonies, and many ways of leading socialism on the basis of a capitalist society should be different. For example, there is a difference between our national bourgeoisie and the bourgeois base of capitalist countries, and intellectuals also have differences, therefore democracy It is very right that the revolution knocked down three enemies, so 1949 10 The prestige of Chairman Mao of the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China was established on January 1. It simply cannot be described in words, and then to engage in the socialist revolution. In practice, I think it is somewhat too mechanically to learn the Soviet Union. For the whole nation of our country, the victory of the democratic revolution is a sign of the turn over of the entire oppressed nation, dealing with the internal class contradictions, without taking into account the nation at the same time. The issue of the front seems to have been overdivided among the intellectuals in the treatment of the national bourgeoisie. \\nThe Communist Party treats bourgeoisie intellectuals of the bourgeois, that is, the old intellectuals, and specifically organized into various democratic parties and non-partisan democrats from all walks of life. I think it is also guilty of fighting against the entire National Front and class to engage in socialist enemies, friends, and our boundaries under the reality of China. The differences are more vague, and thus the inevitable formation of a few years of intellectuals Contribution and role are too undervalued and do not value enough, considering the various democratic parties as decorations and accessories, as followers of the revolution, as well as the tail of the Communist Party. The only merit of the Chinese revolution is the vanguard team belonging to the working class-the CPC. \\n'A hundred flowers are divided, and one hundred families contested' and 'long-term coexistence and mutual supervision' are proposed in a sense a correction in the assessment of the power sharing of the cause of the socialist revolution. Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have indeed done a biased and corrective, it is good, but over millions of party members across the country are afraid they can appreciate and be able to rectify it. The deviation is a very few. \\nThe vast majority of the intellectuals are patriotism in our country, regardless of the circumstances of the country, and now more socialism, will not seem reluctant to accept, it is easy to understand, mainly in the Party's good leadership. \\nHistory and nationalism should affirm that it is as inherited as anything. Many members of the Communist Party are arrogant in ideology and behavior, make themselves ancient, cut off history, deny everything in the past and look down on non-party people, things and things. Party members are self-occupied by educators and reformers. It is the biggest drawback of the Communist Party members, that is, the Communist Party. This time, the 'three hurts' not only the surface phenomenon of the so-called passing field, should be humbly whipped up, into the wood three points to pursue the bottom, with determination, a spicy hand, a set of new leaders who engage in social leaders. It is only right that France is not limited to rectifying the contradictions of party relations on certain specific issues. \\n2. After the 'liberation', is humble to change, or to the problem of 'whole'\\nI say never 'whole', only 'change' is the way, I think of two historical stories:\\nOne is 'whole': Zhou Li Wang abuse, the Chinese people slander the king... to Wei Wu, to slander, to sue, then kill them, the people do not dare to slander the king, the road with eyes. As a result, Zhou Li Wang should not end up, dynasty Lingyi. \\nOne is 'reform': shortly after Zheng Zichan became government, the common people did not understand the reform of many of his political measures. Each gathered in the township school to say the length of the school, or persuaded him to destroy the township school, and the child said: 'The lady is abused and absent, and he who is good is not, he who is good, I change it. My division also, if anything ruined!' The child product knows the truth that 'the mouth of the defense is more than waterproof, the Armageddon and hurt people will be more'. After several years, the people of Zheng Guodazhi loved them very much. \\nI think that the Communist Party engages in socialism is supported by the vast majority of the people, there is no problem, but there are many places to study and debate on the methods of socialism. In recent years, our country has nearly eliminated the exploitative class in economic life and has been liberated, but it has been too bound in the ideological and spiritual life. If it is liberated, it should be done this time by 'sounding', (the masses), help 'the wind.' (Party), Solve the issue of 'spiritual liberation'. \\nSome old party members, who have been born to death after many years, have paid credit to the revolution, bleed hard struggles, some special in life habits, not pretending, and people's contacts are able to understand that they will not have any opinions, but many new party members do not have any merit. The share of the 'one get party membership, one hundred times worth the price, high in the toe' misrepresentation. Son, masses contact must not seem to have opinions-this ancient analogy, 'Sishi Shi 'It is not surprising that the masses have a lot of opinions on party members. The masses have opinions on party members, and the masses have no stereotyping of party members. \\nIn short, party members should be humbly 'change' only, the requirements for change are not too high:\\n1. More than ten million party members should change the style of 'Qin Shi Emperor', arbitrariness and arbitrariness, it would not work to ignore the masses. The Qin Shihuang attacked his father and grandfather in the late Warring States, and to unify the world, it would be remarkable. Do whatever they want, do not allow the common people to speak, the forbidden, even people abandon the city, strengthen the Great Wall, all the sons of the hundreds of theories, burn the book pit, arrogant claim to the 'Emperor', think that he is a monarch for King II III to the world, and now party members have a bad style to the same extent as the Qin Emperor, millions of Terracotta Emperor Good brain fire, stress change. \\n2. With regard to the 'Party world' and 'party member world' should be clearly stated that the party world is reflected in the correct party, the big duke's selfless policy. As for specific party members, it should not be the same as the masses. At present, the party members are aristocrats, and the masses are untouchable, they should be reformed from the style of party members-this even Take into account organ party committee leadership 'improvement problem of style'. \\nIn particular, in my organs, or in every organ, school, group, occasion, party and non-party 'within a day, between one house, one house,' should be changed to the same climate situation. \\n4. the kind of party members governing people, non-party members cure people, the situation is worse than the laborers, the laborers heal the situation is worse, stress change, (at present party members are not obliged to produce, non-party members eat people-labor cannibals, laborers eat people, the situation is too bad)-should include party members should be virtuous Practice business, engage in business, the superior crown unveiled. \\n5. The status quo of party members 'do not let it go' should be changed in order to break down the wall and fill the ditch, and 'sweeping' will never be in chaos, because it does not involve negating the party leadership's negation of the socialist path. Party members from outside, at least do not want to brainstorm about party leadership and socialist construction cause Removing the wall ditch is dangerous. \\n6. There is no 'friends' problem in Wuren, I think only the masses do not have friends, and party members 'have comrades will have friends' because once they have acquired party nationality, the public and private care between comrades do everything to do so, it is precisely the full play of the role of friends, the masses contact with people, easy to 'engage' Small group', 'style improperly' hat, remember I fill in union or personnel several times Table on the 'close relationship' after liberation, some say 'comrades' squeeeze out 'friends' words are not appropriate, this situation should change, (I say not to promote small circles, I think, people are emotional animals should let emotion have a way out of legitimate development, don't friends to be the usual right (Also available only by party members). \\n7. On the issue of United War, I participated in the A&M Democratic Party in December 1952. I have a rough grasp of the United War work for several years. In general, I think that the United War work carried out by the Democratic Party is a half-hearted united war work that follows the Communist Party. It is not a form that can synchronize the convergence, but only a party that does not have any brains at all. Yun is the cloud, the party step by step, so being ridiculed the democratic party is the tail of the party, In fact, the same is true. How can it play the full active role and solidarity role of small bourgeois and bourgeois intellectuals? I think the Party should seriously consider and improve the policy measures of United War. I say that the democratic party, i.e. intellectuals from all levels, can contribute to socialist construction. The potential of the industry is great. \\n8 our company should change some specific problems: 'manager, party books only close to the personnel section, not close to the business sections', 'personnel political section leadership business department ideology style', 'used to find the masses, as the practice of buying leaders happy activists and listening to reports', 'Yan Tailin, Wang Baosheng 'Cadre style', 'meeting cadres (managers)', 'training and promotion of cadres ( Party members and activists)', 'One year to the left to send right to send learning cadres', 'long years of years to work, let them be allowed to do so, archive cadres (such as Deng Cheng is)', 'Party committee leadership without everyone leading everything', 'Party party political sentiment improvement' and so on... in me, in While requiring the Party to demand leadership change, it is not possible to relax the reform of itself, improve party relations or improve party group relations. Work or better socialist cause is a problem that requires everyone to manual brains, 'can not be considered irrelevant to me'-I think that the end purpose of the wind is here, and that's the ultimate purpose of the big winds is that.

It is now that there is democracy and rhetoric, even the team leader is elected in equal terms, and the equals are disguised appointments. What is not on the equal vote is one thousandth, sending down the list is to make everyone circle...' 'Our national equal election is just a circle, and it's him, you don't choose him, he also elected, you choose him, he also elected, that is, the party decided, what do you still use to choose?' 'Equal elections are not democratic.' The vote said, 'What does this mean, is to draw '○'. Is there democracy in our country? Not at all.' 'Our national democracy is the form that represents 100% by which is democracy? The Western parliamentary system, where all parties debated each other and abusive, it is democracy, can we draw the truth!' \\nNie Nie qixin said: 'Hu Shi really has a great literary genius, which is not comparable to our country's current literary. This is an amazing literary.' \\nNie Qi-xin said: 'The Democratic Party has become a flagrant shouting. People outside the party have no authority to do leadership work, only the obligation to implement the resolution, and there is no real possibility of participating in decision-making.' \\nNie Nie qixin constantly praised the thugs in the Hungarian incident and said: 'People in Europe are doing, and the Chinese are finished.' Nie Nie qixin said that Stalin is a killer devil. Stalin's position to achieve the goal by all means (killing the closest comrades), to achieve the goal, today Stalin's death (referring to Stalin's mistakes), because Burganin wants to revenge. \\nNie Nie qixin said: 'Be sure to go to the United States to study abroad after graduation, and have to go to food.' 'The majority of those who went to the United States to study abroad were PhD, while several PhD students went to the Soviet Union.' \\nAfter the outbreak of the Egyptian war, he said: 'Unfortunately, Britain, even an Egyptian fight...' 'If the Soviet Union sends troops, it will cause the US to join the war, so that the world war can be fought.' \\n'An ordinary worker in the United States can send $60-70 a week, with China $6,700 a month, higher than Chairman Mao!' 'American industry is really so developed'. 'Our country has not doubled the US by 10% higher, we will never catch up with the United States.' \\nWhen he looked at the right-wing defamation of the Soviet Union, he said, 'How can our country be endless!' 'Longyun this person is truly patriotic', 'The people who are anti-Longyun have no conscience.' \\n'Soviet Bulganin and Khrushchev worst, should come to the second Hitler war to wipe out the Soviet Union.' \\n'The Hungarian events, mainly caused by the Soviet Union, were caused by Stalin's mistakes,' Nie said. Soviet troops were interfering in Hungary. 'The Hungarian incident was mainly caused by the Soviet Union, mainly due to criticism of Stalin's mistakes.' \\nNie Nie qixin: 'What democracy does our country have, we cannot march, and what democracy is there?! There is no democracy at all... The master of the defense is more than Fogawa.' \\n'Our national democracy is the form, representing 100 per cent adoption, which is democracy? Western parliamentary system, all parties debating each other and abusive are democracy, and can we draw the truth!' \\n'Everyone has the right to demonstrate, no one can intervene, and interference is undemocratic and unconstitutional (referring to the events of 'six, 12'). \\n'Who determines our national events? Decided on the Party Central Politburo. People's congresses are merely formal. You see, there is no controversy at all when it comes to the congresses by raising hands unanimously. But the Western Congress system is different! Every meeting is debated... the issues can be clear, opinions can be broad and, of course, more democratic.' 'Democracy is the country, that political party, how much do you want, how much do you want to do it?' \\nWhen the Liu Nature incident occurred in Taiwan, and the Taipei newspaper published this, Nie Nie qixin said: 'Look, how do you say that capitalist newspapers are not good, anti-US things are published. If we have a Soviet crime incident, our newspapers cannot report, this is not as good as capitalist countries.' 'People's Daily has sectarianism. Democratic Party newspapers solve the problem and can speak for us.' \\nNie Nie qixin said: 'Zhang Bisheng is really right to talk about counterproductive aspects. Of the 5% centrally controlled figure, the peasants went to 500 million, and the children in the city did not do it, so that 5 per cent of the 600 million counter-revolutions were 30 million, in the units of the anti-movement, an average of 5-6 people there was a counter-revolution, which is not an expansion What is Dahua?' \\nNie Qi-xin said: 'The wrong issue about the rebellion is indeed very serious. Many people have been wrong. As a result, how can it be done, hurt feelings, private searches. This all undermines the rule of law. These workers should be punished by law... There is a mistake and arrest by communist party members for personal blow. Can revenge, deceit? For example, an old professor in the School of Finance and Economics was wrong (referring to Zhao Hongzhu). How can I say that it can't be avoided?' \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 3"}

He joined the army in 1945 in 10, in February 1947, and worked in the Information Office of the Fueno Command after joining the army. After graduating from the military, assigned to the second line command, before coming to Fort as assistant in the Naval Political Department Enemy Department, the rank of lieutenant. After leaving the Fort in jiexiu County Labor Bureau, food company work, 1964 back to his origin in Xingtai, as a salesman in the local company. After the correction was the prime minister of the enterprise company in xingtai city, suburban deputy governor, district governor, chairman of the CPPCC, and members of Xingtai City CPPCC. \\nTen years began, I worked as a business accountant in Neiqiu County, Hebei province, in charge of commodity accounts. According to the movement spear should point to the 'walker', then manager Wang Shixiang, old rape and slippery, and local people, the company is mostly his folks, he usually good at using small grace to pull people together. The villains did not focus on him, but they took the three of us: Zhang Hengchang, I and Ivenpiao. \\nZhang Hengchang is a financial accounting, born rich farmer, work rigorously, seriously adhere to the financial system, for the manager to approve white terms, not in accordance with the financial system is to give the top back not to be reimbursed. This offended some people, movement, it was the opportunity of the villain to be worthy, the first to find out was he, said that he was born rich farmers, and his hometown folks, and said that he had economic problems, the accounting team checked for a few months... nothing was detected. The villains said that he was not old to buy, tortured to confess to tied up beating. He was angry with liver cancer, rolled in bed when he was painful, and no one was treated, and soon he was tortured and died. \\nI am the 'philosopher' said one of the five categories of black, 1957 old books were raised again, the neck hanging more than 20 pounds of iron medals on the street show public, the fight will almost open every day. In order to show enthusiasm, the anti-wing party started in the afternoon, and overtime work at night. I was 1 meter 78 tall, when I bent over villains, I bend enough standards, put my head down hard pressed, bent people into shrimp shape, legs are not bent. The fight will open for a few hours, the waist will be bent for a few hours, sometimes really support can not fall to the ground, after they still have to fist their feet together, said it is not honest. After months of toss, the lumbar pain is unbearable, so far, leaving the legacy of uncured, with a disease, but also to participate in endless manual labor. The loading and unloading truck turned out to be a migrant worker or a handling unit, and the villains in the movement imposed on us as a means of punishment. Arrive in the middle of the night, get up and unloading. Overload of labor, really unbearable, really want to die, but another thought: what are we wrong? Be sure to bite your teeth and insist, wait until the day of the rebellion, and never let these people's conspiracy succeed. \\nIvenpiao is a Shang County of East Timor, a military soldier of the army, a member of the Communist Party, and honesty. Why pulled him out as a traitor? It is puzzling. He was born from a poor farmer and joined the PLA in his teenage age. He was unable to march with the troops because of illness, and led him to foster him in the homes of the ordinary people to get sick. This old town is very poor, and he can't afford to buy it, then let him go to the village to become a soldier of the Kuomintang force. Soon this force fought with the PLA, and Ivanpiu was liberated and became known as the PLA, and later went to North Korea to fight, he fought heroically, and soon became part of the party, and he suffered injuries in the battle, and one leg was disabled, which only turned to the place. Throw him out as a traitor and criticize him, and he thought hard to accept. \\nThe comrade was strong, one day after fighting back to our bullshed, I saw his eyes straight into the beams. My intuition tells me that his heart is very painful but inconvenient to talk. The next evening, the train station informed that there were two cars reed foil on the station east platform, and asked us to take care of it. In the past, it was a migrant worker in custody. This can save money and punish us, and this task naturally falls on us. The night look could not sleep, but it was an opportunity to enlighten him. I opened the door to the mountain and said, 'Ivenpiu you are not in the mood for these days. It is about your heart, you can't hide from me, to be honest.' \\nHe fell off without opening tears: 'I really don't want to live, really want to get a rope tied on the beam to end myself.' I solemnly said to him, 'You want to be wrong, you do it, just what those people want, you would not have been a traitor. If you really died, would you not become a traitor of the party and the people? Your wife, Bao'e, became a widow, and your son had lost his father, was not that a house broken dead?' He oops and said: 'Not a place for you, almost done one of the most stupid things, I know!' Then he loved and his son came to see him, and he said to his son, 'I can survive, thanks to your old Nieuber enlightened, he is my savior!' \\nCan you want to get it? Even though I was locked in that year, I became a salvation man. \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"}

After the official establishment of the NLD, as the main part of the middle force, always insisted on democracy, unity and resistance, and with the majesty of the 'active force of the democratic movement', appeared on the political scene of modern China, and 'fighting side by side' with the Communist Party of China. The People's Republic of China was established and the NLD solemnly declares that it will accept the leadership of the Communist Party of China and adopt as its political agenda the Common Platform drawn up by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Since then, the NLD became an integral part of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, known as the Democratic Party. \\nHengyang NLD organization was founded in 1948, in the underground struggle period, with the Communist Party underground organization, to mass propaganda, social investigation, plant maintenance, expansion and countermeasures, has done a lot of work. In 1950, the clean-up process came to an end and was eager to develop the organization, nurture the backbone and create a new job situation. It was in this context that I first joined the League in early 1951. He has served as the head of the group, the chairman of the joint division of the Chinese education division, municipal branch committee and propaganda committee. In August 1952, the market division served as a specialist (secretary), to assist the Chairman Qu Zi Jian catch comprehensive work. At that time, according to the principle of the united war division of labour, the Union Central Committee stipulated that the Union's work focus, mainly in large and medium-sized cities, mainly cultural and educational, middle and upper levels. I was 27 years old, Fenghua Zhengmao, and graduated from college. I had done a high school executive leadership job. It naturally attracted many people's attention. I went to the Union organs for a year out of production. The main achievements were two: first, to capture political ideology education within the Union, strengthen the concept of United War, overcome the idea of 'helping customers' and the idea of 'second place', and initially assembled a number of backbone forces for the League organization; second, with their professional advantages and experience, deep into the grassroots level, to promote the allied members to do their job and play the role of assistant to the party. In the early 50s, the Municipal Cultural and Education Bureau caught inspection and open teaching, caught very tight; every inspection and open teaching, I was invited to participate in the review and was welcomed by schools. \\nIn the summer of 1953, the municipal people's Government planned to redirect south secondary school to public, set to me as the principal; later the plan changed, I was reassigned to the city II as deputy principal. Also because of the city's first school principal Tang Ji (Party Union cross), in China to study, he transferred the city's second school principal Tan Yuesheng (Party Union cross), to the city, and since then I fully chaired the work of the City II as vice-president. In the absence of school organizations and party cadres, I seriously adhere to the Party's education policy, adhere to the popular line, rely on teachers, rely on school regiments, alliances, and trade union organizations to quickly open the situation and actively create conditions that will lead to a turning point in 1954 in the spirit of implementing the meeting of administrative cadres of the provincial education department. In the school to become the city's largest, good quality education, with certain characteristics of a complete secondary school. As a school leader, I have focused on my career, such as teacher preparation, pilot work, personal participation, continuous exploration, and accumulated experience. Hengyang News (column), published an article on my understanding of improving teaching and implementing 'teaching unity'. Hengyang medical school (formerly known as Hengyang health school), was founded in the beginning, and improve the school leadership core, strengthen teaching management and organization issues, the Propaganda Department of the local committee through the publicity department of the municipal committee invited me to 'propaganda' for its use. Later, the Municipal Arts and Education Bureau also for secondary school teachers, organized a city-wide report for me; also sent Wen Xiuyu and others to school to organize materials, called me 'young educator'. These words of repudiation and beauty are well deserved, but to a large extent they serve as a spur for me. \\nI'm not only duty-bound to do what the school should do, but also participate in the social activities. Since December 1953, he was elected member of the NLD Municipal Division and Minister of Information for two consecutive terms. Since April 1954, two consecutive sessions were elected as municipal people's representatives, second district (Chengbei District), first people's representatives and government members. I insist on a principle; do not hang a blank title, every meeting will come, will speak and start thinking about the problems of mind, especially the Union organs are in close proximity, more than asking the work of a little League, and caring for the consolidation and development of the organization, it is more reasonable for granted. It is almost possible to say that before I was called the 'right', the main documents that occurred within the League were mostly finalized by me. A group of middle and upper intellectuals such as Chen Zhi Sen, Qu Xiangrong, Ou Jianhong, Liu Guangzu, Wang Sanyi, Cao Liuzhong, Haulizhong, etc., were also developed under my direct and indirect influence. \\nIn February 1956, the NLD convened two congresses to put forward the slogan 'All for socialism' as the overall policy task of the NLD in the future. Since then, the provincial branch of the NLD was renamed the NLD Provincial Committee; the NLD municipal branch was renamed the NLD Municipal Committee; and the grass-roots division was renamed branch branch. When I formulated the seven-year plan for ideological and political work in the League City, I stressed that promoting the intellectuals associated with the Union is the soul of the League's work, and that working to connect with the masses must be faithfully reflecting their opinions and legitimate demands, and paying attention to propagating the party's policy towards them. Over the years, I have been relentlessly reading Chairman Mao's book and the classic writings of Director Marxiser, and engaged in a five-year scientific research plan, ambitious, and wanted to systematically justify 'Chairman Mao's great contribution to Marxist Leninism.' Later, this plan is as a 'typical' captured by the municipal education union system in response to the party's call to advance into science. \\nIn April 1957, the Communist Party Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPPCC), came forward to organize the municipal people's representatives and CPPCC members to inspect the literary front. A briefing session will be held later, and I was pushed to take the floor during the briefing by the Literary Front Inspection Group. Because it is reporting, according to the record, I do not take any trade-offs, do not make personal analysis, how the grass-roots talk, that is, to reflect it factually. Only at the end of my speech, I spoke a little personal opinion, and that in order to implement the policy of 'a lot of flowers and bring out new things', the CPC Municipal Committee must strengthen political ideological leadership for entertainers and further Improve performance conditions and do more specific help. At the end of the month, the Communist Party Committee held a forum on knowledge. The meeting was attended by me and Deng Guangju, director of the three hospitals, and Wang Jialin, director of the four hospital. At the beginning of my statement at the meeting, I highly praised Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Council as a new development of Marxism Leninism and certainly a great encouragement to himself. I immediately contacted some of the problems that existed in the pilot work of the 'anti-general democracy movement' II, from the leadership and the masses. Face to look for reasons and find solutions. I said that in order to resolve these problems, we must follow the 'uniting-criticism-unity' approach, based on Chairman Mao's teachings, and be honest and honest. This meeting, Hengyang News made a detailed report, 'Hengyang News' reproduced only a summary, and only covered my statement. In May, the League Provincial Committee was replaced by me, temporarily acting as deputy chairman committee, in July starting salary from the Union organ, municipal administration changed to part-time, I said that I obey the arrangement. In June, invited to participate in the expanded meeting of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC. I talked about the issue of party-political relations and intellectuals. I said: The party is a high-level form of organization for the proletariat. Without party leadership, there can be no proletarian dictatorship and socialism. Therefore, the Party's leadership in all aspects of the country's work is unwavering and welcome by the masses. The question is not whether the party should and can lead, but how the party leads. I think that the basic way for the Party to realize its own leadership should be to put forward the correct ideas and lines, and to turn it into the government's policy and policy and the conscious actions of the masses through discussion of consultations and persuading education. As for the specific work belonging to the government, the organization of the party should be supported by principle. Rudder, play a guarantee and supervisory role, and should not intervene in ultra vires with a 'special identity'. If I have no mistakes in these views, then, I think there are a lot of phenomena worth considering when measuring the party and government relations in Hengyang city with these views. On the question of intellectuals, I think that the Party Central Committee has always attached great importance to the unity education of intellectuals. The estimates are also very correct for the progress of intellectuals over the years and their role in socialist construction. There is no 'copper wall' between the whole party and intellectuals; Some local leaders and cadres have a rocking phenomenon in implementing the Party's policies. In conclusion, I am self-critical of the work of the NLD, and I said that, as an assistant to the intellectuals and the Communist Party, it is far from doing well in these areas and should be significantly improved in the future. \\nAbove is the main words and deeds of my young age business with the years before 1957. I remember that the leader of the United Front Work Department of the Hunan District Party Committee revealed to the Party Committee that Hengyang Nie shouzhong is a young and effective cadre of the Democratic Party. To be sure, 8 years of hard work, some shortcomings in the work, understanding of the one-sided nature, but a sincerity to the day can watch, there is nothing sorry about the party. Before the CPPCC meeting, 'Hengyang News' also set up a 'column', every day is a quarter of the layout, to 'right' row 'seats', then called 'Zhang' (Bejun), Luo (Longji), Chu (Anping), Du (Maizhi), Nie'. A whimsical article, covered, really blue thunderbolt, 'is a woe to escape'. I was hit right, battered for a year. As the movement progressed in depth, the leaders of the League Municipal Committee have successively landed Qu Zijian, Jiang Xun, Pi Xinxuan, Zhou Ji, etc., occupy about 3/4 of the leadership team; grassroots cadres or general members of the League are misclassified as right-wing with Liao Xianhao, Huang Zhipu and other 22 people, accounting for about 1/6 of the total number of alliance members. Hengyang League organization since then vitality injury, a loss. \\nOn June 1, 1958, the organization announced the treatment of me: the removal of all posts inside and outside the Union, dismissal from public office and re-education through labour. After three and a half years, he lifted re-education through labour, as 'idle labor' in society, relying on temporary workers to support their families, rain and wind, 18 spring and autumn, wives and children suffer from strains of discrimination, eating a lot of hardship, naturally needless to say. \\nThe Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the 11th Central Committee, as Chunlei, gave me a second life in politics. Since then, I was a lecturer in Hengyang teacher, director of the Education and Technology Committee, director of the Communist Committee of Arts, Education and Technology Committee, director of the Political Liaison Committee and Municipal Committee Consultant; in the municipal CPPCC Standing Committee two sessions, one CPPCC member. Looking back, 40 years have passed, why repent? In this year too rare, 'dying old candlestick frightened, deaf heart to children. The best opportunity to fight, heavy care and friends attack.' It can be said so, however, the 'sunset red' is not a dynasty after all. It really wants to do something to the Party to the people, how easy to talk about it! Friends' love, ordered to leave a little claws on the passing years, because the 'chronicle poem' has not yet been paid. 'Poetry, singing words', is not history, but also history, sins, for readers to 'anatomy sparrow' can also be order. Ding Ugly Autumn Day\\n"},

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】Li Yixiu: 'Nie yuchan-the first person to engage in higher care education in China'\\nNie yuchan is a nursing educator, nursing administration expert. The first person in China to work as a leader in higher nursing education. We have trained a group of excellent nursing teachers and nursing administration personnel in China, and established a complete nursing management system. She insists on high standards, strict requirements, learning to use, school use, and set a model of nursing work in higher education and teaching hospital care. She attached importance to public health care and stressed the importance of health literacy. Later she went through a bumpy, but not enough commitment; as long as there was a chance to work, go all out. She has been academically advanced, technically advanced, dedicated to her career, and has established the image of a true white warrior. \\nNie Yuchen, formerly known as Nie yuchan, was born on May 11, 1903 in Dusai Town, Funing County, Hebei Province, an enlightened gentleman's family with a brother and a sister and two brothers. At that time, the idea of being a woman who had no talent was German was very common. The woman who was able to go to private school was already a far-reaching woman, while Nie Yuchen's father was open to mind, not to favor men and women. He used the county's temples to run schools to recruit boys and girls to study. Their children are also treated equally regardless of sex and choose a good school to send them to study. He believes that the biggest ills in society at that time were poverty, foolish, weak and private, and that everyone had a responsibility to deal with them and remedy them. Nie yuchan admired her father since childhood, was deeply influenced by his thoughts, and was determined to make a difference when he grew up. \\nAfter graduating from local primary school, Nie Yuchen's father sent her and her sister to Tianjin Central and Western Girls High School. This is a church school, teaching rigorously and has a good reputation. Nie yuchan clever people, excellent academic achievement. In addition to various recreational activities on campus, she also participated in the Tianjin student movement led by Zhou Enlai. After reaching out to society, she felt more weak in China, thinking from time to time about what she could do. At that time, there were few jobs for women except as housewives, and once married, they could easily be dismissed. She thought again and again, believing that she could be a doctor to remove the Chinese 'East Asian sick man' hat; and was determined not to marry for life in order to play her full capacity in her career. \\nNankai University has close ties with Chinese and Western girls middle school. Outstanding graduates of Chinese and Western women can be sent to Nankai University without trial guarantee. Nie yuchan was one of the escorts, but she did not go because Nankai University had no medical department, and she directed the Beijing Union Medical College. With medical schools and nursing schools, the Union Medical College was the highest medical institution in the country at that time; the entrance examination was very strict, with a small number of admissions per year and fewer girls enrolled. In 1923, Qiu Nie Yuzen was admitted. \\nBefore entering school, Nie yuchan knew little about nursing work. After entering the Union Medical College, she began to contact some nursing students, including one of the third-graders who were her past classmates. At the first meeting, Nie Yuchen saw that they were dressed in blue and white very elegant overalls, gracious attitude and courteous, they had a cordial feeling and a good impression on the nurses. They introduced her to study and live in nursing schools. She then approached a number of nurses. There is an operating room nurse who is the mother of her secondary school classmates, paying special attention to her life and study. The nurse often briefed Nie Yuchen on the importance of nursing work, describing the current lack of medical care, especially the lack of leadership skills. She praised the advantages of discipline and discipline, and encouraged Nie Yuchen to move to nursing school. She believed that in society at that time, being a nurse was the most productive career for women. Affected by this, Nie yuchan thought repeatedly, thinks that care is indeed an important part of the health care business. You should change the nurse yourself. Nurses do not depart from their original intention to treat 'weak'. Nurses can also contribute to improving people's physical quality and rehabilitation of patients. In addition, school care time is shorter than medicine and can work early, which can reduce the financial burden on the families who are not wealthy, and can also invest early in the nurses who lack talent Wu. Thoughtful and determined again, Nie yuchan submitted his application to the Academic Affairs Office of the Union Medical College for transfer from medical school to nursing school. The history of nursing profession in China is very short, only in 1884 by American nurse Mikchini (Mckchini), into China, and in 1888, American Johnson (JOHN), opened the first nurse school in Fuzhou. Due to the influence of feudal consciousness and the lack of a formal education system, the general population considers care as low-grade jobs, with few willing to do so, and the majority of the society disregard nurses. Many nurses also lack self-esteem, active research into business, and striving to move forward; resulting in a slippage in care work from time to time. And Nie Yuchen decided to transfer care from medical care. At that time, nursing education in the country was still in its infancy, and there was no uniform teaching standard and academic system. With the exception of a very few nurse schools that enroll high school graduates, most recruit junior high school graduates, or even primary school graduates. Learning methods are mostly apprenticeship, theoretical lessons are few, many internships, and actually use the cheap labor of nurse students to work for the ward. There are few nurses graduating in the ward, mostly by senior students leading lower grades, with more than 72 hours of internship and class hours a week, so many nurses are those with religious beliefs as a dedication, and generally few people are willing to work as nurses. \\nThe founders of the Union Medical College understand the close relationship between medical care and believe that it is not possible to have quality medical education and improve the quality of care. Therefore, it was decided to organize nursing schools of the same level as the world's best advanced nursing schools, in conjunction with medical schools, in order to develop advanced care cadres. At that time, there were only a small number of translated secondary nursing materials in the country. In order to improve the student's standard, it was necessary to read a large number of reference books in foreign languages. Therefore, it was decided to teach English in addition to one Chinese language curriculum, and it was very demanding for students, although this was a university level, with the training of nursing teachers and backbone as the first task. There are still few scholars. When Nie yuchan asked to transfer to the nursing school, the first class of students of the school had not yet graduated, and the whole school students were just over 10. Nie yuchan's application caused great confusion to the school authorities, believing that she was a one-time impulse before making such an abnormal application, and was therefore not granted. However, once Nie yuchan has made a determination, it is difficult to change her mind. She has repeatedly applied, and the school replied that parental consent is required to be considered. Nie yuchan wrote to her father explaining his willingness to transfer a nurse. Her father replied: 'Choosing a career is a great thing for you in your life and it's up to you to decide.' As a result, she was finally authorized to transfer from medical school to nursing school. \\nKyowa Nursing School has a wide range of courses, and Nie Yuchen carefully studied. 'What is the use of doing a nurse to learn so many courses' from time to time from time to time, but she is not moved. \\nAfter graduating from 1927, Nie Yuchen was hired as Deputy Nurse Chief of Concord Hospital Ward. While she leads nurses for clinical care, she often understands patients and analyzes the causes of their onset. She saw that these patients were not only physically and mentally suffering, but also that many people left the world prematurely because they were unable to heal or were too late to seek medical treatment. If they have knowledge of hygiene and develop good habits, it is easy not to get sick. Although she constantly propagates disease prevention care knowledge to patients in the ward, she always feels that it is too late to do publicity at this time. The disease should be prevented in the future. The general public must have health knowledge in order to enable them to enhance their physical health and reduce the incidence. In the area of nursing, public health care has just begun in China, and Nie Yuchen is determined to move from hospital to society. She applied to the Ministry of Nursing to the Ministry of Nursing to the First Health Office of the Public Health Laboratory Area of Medical College as a public health nurse. The hospital did not want to lose such a promising nurse chief, suggesting that if they were to be transferred as a public health nurse, they had to move out of the nurse dormitories and lower salaries. Nie yuchan, regardless of personal gains and losses, accepted the conditions and began public health care work. \\nNie yuchan has performed well in her work. The School of Medicine decided to send her to the Department of Public Health, School of Medicine, University of Toronto, Canada, in 1929 to pursue public health care. In 1930 she obtained a certificate of public health care. She was also asked to continue her studies at Columbia University Teachers College in the United States. She graduated in Nursing Education and other courses and obtained her Bachelor of Science in 1931. After returning home, he served as Public Health Care Director of Beiping First Health Firm, training a group of early public health nurses in China and broadened the field of preventive medicine in China. She was the first person to engage in higher nursing education in China. Cultivate a number of excellent nursing teachers and nursing administration personnel. After the bumpy in life, still steadfast, love work, tireless. Nie yuchan not only has talent, perseverance and courage in his work, but also actively participates in social activities. She participated in student movements during secondary school. In 1933, she hosted the Beijing Nurses Congress on behalf of the Chinese Nurses Association (later renamed Chinese Nursing Society, China Nursing Society, now known as China Nursing Society), calling nurses to participate in anti-Japanese ambulance work; and organized ambulance training courses for college and secondary school students. In 1937, he was elected representative of the Public Health Committee of the International Association of Nurses. He was elected Chairman of China Nursing Society in 1946. In 1947, a delegation from the Chinese Nursing Society (including Wang Yafang, Lai Zuhua, Zhu Bihui and Tian Cuili), went to the United States to attend the Ninth International Nursing Association Congress and the General Assembly. In 1948, Nie Yuchen conveyed the spirit of the International Nurses Conference and laid out the work of the Society. In 1950, Nie Yuchen was elected as the executive director of the Society. In 1962, he was elected President of Anhui Branch of the Chinese Nursing Society. Nie Yuchen was selected as an honorary member in 1983 due to her long-term contribution to the work of the Chinese Society of Nursing. In recognition of Nie Yuzen's contribution to nursing education, in 1987, KUH Alumni Kwok Huanwei initiated and first donated to set up the Nie Yuzen Award Fund. The move received a response from many alumni and friends abroad. Since 1989, two teachers receive this bonus each year. In 1988, Nie Yuchen was hired as honorary director of nursing department by Peking Union Medical University of China. Nie yuchan in academic research and enterprising, technical excellence, everywhere. Lead by example, regardless of adversity, with excellent work performance and frank attitude to impress, established a tall image of a true white angel, won the respect of people. \\nOn August 22, 1998, Nie Yuchen died of heart failure in Beijing Union Hospital due to lung infection. \\nFirst person in higher nursing education in China\\nIn 1935, the Department of Health and the Ministry of Education of Nanjing National Government jointly established three education committees for medicine, nurses and midwives. Nie yuchan was appointed as secretary of the Nurse Education Committee. He was responsible for investigating the situation in nurses schools nationwide, setting standards for nurses schools, and qualified persons registered. This work has some significance for raising the national level of nursing education, but the work is not easy, and is often interfered and constrained by various aspects. Nie Yuchen believes that in order to make her work unrestrained by others, it is necessary to improve his own level. In 1936, he went to the United States again to enter the University of Michigan Medical School of Public Health at his own expense. Student education. Master of Science degree in 1938 and a doctoral scholarship. At this time, the artillery fire of the domestic anti-Japanese war has started, and Nie yuchan gave up his scholarship and departed for home. \\nShe was planning to visit her old mother in Beiping and went to the mainland. But Nie yuchan's return home was informed by the Dean of the Union Medical College. They are looking for a Chinese man who can replace Hu Zhimin, the outgoing Nursing School Principal. After the study, the board agreed that Nie yuchan's education, qualifications, talents and boldness met the requirements of the successor principal, and decided to hire her to the job. Hu Hengde, Dean of the Union Medical College, invited her to apply. Nie yuchan said she was going back to China to help fight the sunrise. Hu Hengde said: 'The Nursing School of Union Medical College is the only senior nursing school in China, and now we have to give the position of principal to the Chinese. Is it not more meaningful than you go to the Mainland by taking over as a principal, and can train many nurses who can play a role in all parts of the country?' Nie yuchan was persuaded to assist Hu Zhimin in 1938 as assistant principal. In 1940, Hu Zhimin returned to the United States, and Nie Yuchen took over the position of Principal Nursing School. \\nNie yuchan is the fourth president and the first Chinese to serve as Director of the Nursing Department of Concord Hospital. She took office when she took office secretly determined, the first was to compete for the Chinese people and to run a better care school. She worked at her work, working in the office every morning at 6:30am. She attaches great importance to the curriculum. She believes that students entering nursing schools must study social sciences, pedagogy, psychology, biology, chemistry and other social and natural sciences at the university so that they can think and analyse health, disease and care from a physiological, psychological and social perspective. She also attaches great importance to nurse students' moral quality, teaching nurse ethics in person. She believes that theory must be factual in learning. She asked teachers to take students to the ward for clinical observation when teaching a certain disease, care and technical operation. Students should be guided by the theory they learned during the internship, and the study is consistent. All kinds of nursing operations must have more than three practical experience to graduate, and if there is no chance to complete during the internship, the teacher is responsible for arranging students to return to the school to fill up the practice experience even if you have left the undergraduate degree. Each student completes a case study during an internship in the internal and surgical wards. Teachers select cases and assign students to take care of the patient from admission to discharge. Students' comprehensive observation and understanding of the patient, including their personal history, family situation, social background and etiology, condition, diagnosis, treatment and course of the patient, analysis, treatment and course of the patient, the analysis and development of the care plan for all aspects of the body and psychosocial care and the facilities to be adopted Physical measures, modified or supplemented according to the effect of implementation and the progress of the disease. Before the patient is discharged from the hospital, the nursery must not only give good health care guidance, but also contact the social services department in the hospital to help them solve their problems. Finally, students have to write a complete report to the teacher, who selects the best to communicate among their classmates. 'Case studies' are a very important measure in internships. This approach not only provides students with a detailed understanding of care work, taking care of patients as thoughtful, emotional and socially connected persons, but also strengthens students' ability to observe and analyze, and is effective in developing high-quality nurses. In order to ensure that the theory is consistent with the practical and learned, Nie yuchan also stressed that the nursing school teachers must also serve as internship hospital ward supervisors, and are responsible for leading the nursing work and clinical teaching of the ward, so that what is learned in the classroom and what is done in the ward is perfectly matched. \\nIn the area of hospital care administration, Nie Yuchen requires all wards to draw up complete care routine and operating procedures, and print them into a book, as the norm that nurses must observe and study materials for students. Newly hired nurses must be familiar with these routines and operations before they can be formally introduced. Ward items have a certain place, inventory, please have uniform rules, ward management to be standardized. Patient care is a high standard and demanding, and no error or negligence is allowed. Every nurse, head of nurse and supervisor is required to perform a regular job appraisal, which is signed by the nurse himself, and is placed in the personal technical file of the Department of Nursing as a reference for appointment and promotion. \\nThe Pacific War broke out at a time when Nie yuchan's work is flourishing. On December 8, 1942, Nie Yuchen arrived at the office at 6:30am as usual. This day is the first day for third-grader students to attend the three-day graduation examination sponsored by the Chinese Institute of Nursing. If this door fails, you cannot take the next two days of the exam, so everyone is nervous. Year 2 students are in obstetrics, gynaecology and paediatric wards, and first-grade students are attending classes. More than eight o'clock in the morning, the hospital was occupied by the Japanese invading forces. Nie yuchan feared that the students taking the exam panicked and affected their grades; immediately went to the examination room and told the students: 'There is a visit by the Japanese army today. This is unusual, everyone do not panic, the exam will be conducted as usual.' This stabilizes the student's emotions. Later, even though the Japanese army moved into the examination site, the examination was still held, and all the students who took the exam passed the exam and obtained a certificate. Under such exceptional circumstances, Nie Yuzen did not relax the teaching and internship work of students for a minute, and did not delay a little homework before the Japanese invading army ordered the suspension of classes. On 19 January 1942, the Japanese Aggression Army ordered the sections to be closed for one week and students to withdraw from the dormitories within two days. Nie yuchan secretly dispersed students to internships in hospitals such as Dao ji, colleagues, women and infants and neutrals and the First Health Office, and arranged teachers to attend classes so that students can complete their studies and participate in and pass the graduation examination of the Chinese Institute of Nursing, and issued certificates to faculty members. in order to work otherwise. Nie yuchan's spirit of responsibility in the end under this extremely difficult circumstances moved all the teachers and students at the time. \\nIn the spring of 1943, after Nie yuchan placed the students properly, he travelled to the Mainland with his three brothers. Intended to go to the Mainland to resume school. At that time, the Japanese invaders were very controlled, and they departed with simple outfits, moving along the way to train, row cars, trucks, and move hard. On the way, her three brothers were unfortunately shot dead in a quarrel with KMT soldiers. Nie Yuchen waved his tears after his three brothers and went on to move forward, and arrived in Chongqing two months later. At that time, intransigent universities gathered in Chengdu, students have a rich source and strong strength of teachers in the early courses. Some teachers and graduates of the former Union Nursing School also came to Chengdu. At that time, West China University was building a new hospital, and student internships were not a problem, but decided to resume school in Chengdu. In that year, students who had completed the pre-care requirements were enrolled from various universities in Chengdu. The new hospital at West China University, which had not yet been fully completed, was officially opened in September that year. Nie yuchan led everyone to work together, work hard, maintain the inherent level of Xiehe Nursing School. At the same time, given the shortage of teachers in nursing schools at that time, Nie yuchan also launched a two-year teacher training class to train nursing education talents. \\nIn August 1945, the War of Resistance against Japan won, Beijing Union Medical College decided to relocate the nursing school back to Beiping in 1946. Starting from scratch in Chengdu, the newly settled nursing school has to move back to Beiping, many things that do not need to be brought back to deal with in situ. Nie yuchan worked hard, after all arrangements, led more than 60 teachers and students to leave Chengdu on April 24, and walked for nearly two months, returned to Beiping in mid-June. In that year, the nursing school enrolled more than 10 new students. Together with the second and third graders brought back from Chengdu, the school began on October 1. At that time, the Kyowa Medical College had recovered its output from the Japanese aggressors, but most of the houses had been leased to the Executive Department of the Military Coordination Office, and neither the hospital nor the medical school had been restored, and there were problems with the teaching and clinical internships of the Nursing School. Nie yuchan went on all sides to seek assistance. He invited experts from the former Union Medical College to assist lectures. He also contacted Neutral, colleagues, mothers, infants, children and other hospitals for internship, and recruited graduates and hospital nurses to prepare for the re-opening of the hospital. On May 1, 1948, the hospital began admitting inpatient patients, and the medical school officially opened on 27 October 1948. At this point, the school care work is restored to normal order, teaching, experiments and internships are guaranteed. Hospital wards were also restored one after another, or opened all. Teaching and hospital work is on the right track again. \\nUnder the leadership of Nie yuchan, not only the quality of care at Concord Hospital has become a national model, but also cultivated a number of excellent nursing teachers and nursing administration personnel. Famous Public Health Care Expert in China, China's First Nightingale Medal Laureate, Honorary President of the Chinese Society of Nursing, Honorary President of the Chinese Society of Nursing, Nightingale Medal and Snow Award Winner, Honorary Dr. Lin Juying, University of Kansas City, Missouri, USA、Named by Lanzhou Military Region as Model Nursing Expert, Team Leader of Nursing Team, General Hospital of Lanzhou Military Region General Hospital Xiu Fang, the first head of nursing department after the resumption of higher nursing education, Tianjin Medical College Nursing Department Gan Lanjun, as well as many older nursing specialists in teaching and hospital leadership positions have been Nie Yuchen's students or have learned from her lessons. \\nNie yuchan saw that nursing teachers and administrative staff across the country are insufficient. Considering that undergraduate graduates alone cannot meet the needs of talented people, he has also offered various types of nursing training and study classes, and received further training students from the Ministry of Nutrition and the Ministry of Social Services. Open. This has contributed to the improvement of the professional level of active nurses throughout the country. \\nIn August 1950, the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China held the first national health conference, at which it was decided to include care in secondary education. At that time, the College of Medicine had not yet been taken over, all the work was still under the previous system, and PUCH Nursing School was still enrolled from the universities. January 20, 1951 The Central People's Government and the Ministry of Health of the General Logistics Ministry of the Chinese People's Liberation Army took over Beijing Union Medical College and Peking Union Hospital. In May, Kyowa Nursing School also enrolled a new class of students from various universities. In 1952, he was instructed to stop admissions and switch to Chinese. In 1953, the School of Nursing of the Union Medical College ended. \\nLater bumpy, but unwavering\\nSoon after the takeover of the Union Medical College and Hospital in 1951, Nie Yuchen was sent to Sichuan to work on land reform. Her work at Xiehe Nursing School and Hospital was taken over by others. Half a year later, Nie yuchan returned to Beijing, and soon launched a three-prong, anti-five counter-and ideological reform campaign. Nie yuchan has been unfairly criticized, standing on the side at work. At that time, she couldn't make sense of cancelling the senior nursing school. It was very uncomfortable and sentimental to stop at her hands. As a result, when the Ministry of Health transferred her to the newly established General Hospital of the PLA in 1954 as vice-president. After repeated encouragement from the head of the Ministry of Health, she was hoping that she would be cheer up and play a role in the new position, her enthusiasm for her work rose again. \\nAfter Nie yuchan reported to the PLA General Hospital, the director of the hospital did not arrange specific work for her. She had taken the initiative to gain insight into the care work in the ward and reported daily to the hospital director and made specific comments and recommendations, but the then director did not support her work. She was censorship during the 'anti-Hu' campaign that began shortly afterwards, and her job was more difficult. In order to improve his own thinking level, keep up with the situation, and be conducive to future work, Nie Yuchen submitted an application to the Institute of Socialism to study, and was approved. In the spring of 1957, Nie Yuchen studied at the Institute of Socialism. \\nDuring the study period, 'Naruto' begins. Nie yuchan is a straight sex person. In order to develop the nursing career, she pointed out the problems in nursing work at that time and made some suggestions. Regrettably, in the immediate 'anti-right' campaign, she was classified as a right-wing element. In winter 1959, she was transferred to Anhui Provincial Hospital in Hefei, Anhui Province for rehabilitation. \\nIn Anhui Provincial Hospital, Nie Yuchen does not have a title, sometimes working in the ward and sometimes in rural areas. Nie yuchan never considered personal humiliation, regardless of the nature of the work, are earnestly working hard. He was sent to the pediatric ward to help the chief nurse rectify his work. She helped the nurse chief adjust the bed to the condition of the child, so that the seriously ill child could always be observed and cared for. She improved the sterile isolation system, reduced cross-infection, established a routine system with clear division of duties, and mobilized nurses to make toys for children, so that the look of the ward was quickly refreshed. Soon, her 'right' hat was removed. Nie yuchan was appointed to form the Nursing Department and serve as Nursing Director. Because of her outstanding work skills, the hospital also put the work of the Department of Nutrition into her management. With the support of the head of the hospital, Nie Yuchen was able to send nurses in the hospital. The hiring and dismissal of nurses must also be consulted by the Nursing Department. Nie yuchan set up a technical file for the nurse. The situation is gone without distinction. She also created further training opportunities for nurses, set up a system of regular meetings of nurses, unifies technical operations and restructured wards. With the collaboration of all departments of the hospital, the quality of care was rapidly improved. Soon, the hospital's nursing work became a flag in the province, and Nie yuchan was elected president of the Anhui Branch of the Chinese Nursing Society. \\nIn 1961 anti-' right', the president who supported Nie yuchan's work was criticized, and Nie Yuchen's work was not easy. At the beginning of 1966, Nie Yuchen submitted a retirement application to the director of the hospital due to his poor health condition and had exceeded the retirement age. The application was approved in March of that year. When the retirement procedures have not yet been completed, Nie Yuchen is resting in Beijing, the cultural revolution began. She was pulled back into Hefei and admitted to the 'cattle shed' in the hospital. It was released only in 1972 and was allowed to return to Beijing in 1973. At that time, her house had been occupied by others and could only be a"},

In 1979, her right-wing problem was completely rehabilitated, the Ministry of Health of the PLA General Logistics Department solved her housing problem, and an eye that could be operated was opened, and she gained light again. \\nNie yuchan has never been troubled for her personal gains and losses in the troubled course, but as long as she refers to the nursing career, she still thrives, she is determined to devote her life to the nursing career, but she always feels that she does too little for the people. Nie Yuchen has a high reputation in the care industry. At the age of 80, more than 100 alumni, nurses and experts from Beijing, abroad and returning from abroad gathered to wish her life. At the age of 89, the Chinese Society of Nursing, the Department of Nursing and the Department of Nursing of Peking Union Medical University of China also held a grand ninety celebration for her in accordance with the customs of China Day 9. Usually, her apartment often becomes a place for students at home and abroad to gather and talk. \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"}

These departments should be the focus of this time. said that personnel departments were originally one of the functional sections and should serve production, but now people in those departments were busy all day long without knowing what happened.

He added that some people even saw the cadres of the Personnel Section as 'thighters'. Another serious problem perceived to exist in these sectors is sectarianism. 'Employment only party'. He also said: Party members and cadres from Shanghai China shipyard transferred their loved ones to the factory, and simply became a Luohan and a Guanyin.
