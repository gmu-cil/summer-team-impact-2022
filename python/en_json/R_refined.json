When the party proposed to carry out the wind in the wind and rain, he strongly opposes, and uses the opportunity to 'put' 'Ming' everywhere to light 'fire', incite faculty and students to oppose the Communist Party, and draw up a list privately with Wang Chengji of the School's Jiusan School and Wang Chengshou of the NLD, and organized suspicious organizations-'Assist Party rectification work committee'. Professor Sun Xizhen, lecturer Lu Moye, and Professor Shen Shanhao pointed out that Ren mingshan opposes the use of rapid storm to solve the contradictions against me, and opposes the settlement of internal contradictions within the people by wind and rain. This conspiracy is very obvious. Lu Moye said that Ren mingshan wants to take advantage of the opportunity of good winds for greater democracy, and also threatens the party, saying: The result of the wind and rain will inevitably bring 'hail'. Associate Professor Lu Weizhao said that when enlarging the song, Ren mingshan incite to say: 'It does not matter if the stick is weighing a little bit,' and we want everyone to mention the 'opinion' of a stick to death. He feared that the world was not messy, saying, 'The student is a good thing' and 'can't be rectified now, because the degree of bias is difficult to say', these remarks are vicious. He wants to beat the proletariat with a bourgeois stick, and we have to be beaten and 'patience.' Mr Kim Weicheng, representative of the Registry's team, said: When zooming up, Yen Mingshan gathered people who had been struggled in several campaigns and were dissatisfied with the party, and encouraged them to 'put' 'Ming' and said to these people: 'Do not be afraid, even though something comes to me, I am the director of the Party's rectification committee.' At the meeting, Professor Wang Jie-wu revealed that Ren mingshan argued that the Ming Fang special issue should not be led by the Party Committee, attempting to seize the action of the special issue. \\n\\tThe spokesman also revealed that Ren mingshanzhu had cracked down on party leaders, party members and people close to the Communist Party. Kim Weichun said that when the Academic Affairs Department added a party member cadre, Ren mingshan sarcastic behind it: 'The power of the Communist Party has been strengthened, but the work has done bad.' Li Zhifang of the Registry usually approached the Communist Party. He said that Li Zhifang was 'wires from fire in the House of the Registry', meaning 'can't touch'. Ping Huishan Assistant said: Ren mingshan often slander the education of the regiment, saying that the best cadres of the team are the most likely to lie, saying that the team members are 'Vino Nuo' and 'no thought' people. Ping Hui asked Ren mingshan: Is accepting the leadership of the Party is 'Vino Noir'? \\n\\tRen mingshan's fallacy was severely criticized at the meeting. In refuting Ren mingshan's fallacy, 'the Communist Party does not trust intellectuals' and 'it is a last resort for the Party to ask intellectuals', said: Can the Party ask him to be deputy provost and a member of the provincial CPPCC. Can you still say that the Party does not trust him? Assistant Professor Cai Yongfei said that the party's care for Ren mingshan in life and teaching is also very thoughtful. When he offered more time for scientific research, the leadership also agreed that he resigned from his post as Deputy Provost. But Ren did not do so, and in teaching, he was not only irresponsible, but spent a lot of time on ambitious activities both inside and outside the school. Xu Bukui lecturer and assistant professor Wang Yigong debunked the lie that Ren mingshan said that 'this time it was sick for the Party to destroy the body for the people.' Xu Bukui said: During the period of magnification, he went to the east and put 'fire' everywhere. As a result, could this be said to be for the Party for the people? \\n\\tProfessor Jiang Liangfu has uncovered the despicable two-sided approach that Ren mingshan plays with. When the fourth year of the Chinese language student asked not to test modern Chinese, he said, 'I support you,' while in front of the head of the party branch, 'Modern Chinese cannot be tested.' Jiang Liangfu pointed out that this method is often used by Ren mingshan. Ren mingshan also often blows others and elevate himself. He boasted that the fourth year of the Chinese language students wrote better papers than Hang teachers and the students of the university's Chinese faculties. In fact, this is because the fourth grader of the Chinese language school was taught by him, whose aim was to combat other professors and improve themselves. \\n\\tAt the meeting, Professor Sun Xizhen also uncovered Ren mingshan and Song Yunbin's trick of singing one peace. In the case of the Dragon Quan Tower demolition incident, although the government has given certain penalties to those responsible, Song Yunbin and Ren mingshan are still dissatisfied, saying, 'The Communist Party does not want culture and has a peasant consciousness.' It is 'Li Chuangwang'. Professor Sun Si-chun asked what purpose is Yam Ming Shin to say these words? Professor Ma Chengsheng also revealed that Ren mingshan took advantage of Longquan demolition of the tower and attacked the party in a massive manner. Ma Chengsheng said that when Ren mingshan objected to the decision to deal with the parties involved in the Longquan Tower demolition incident, it was not true that one worker in Maojiabu had been sentenced to one year's imprisonment for breaking a cultural relic. Ma Chengsheng said that the worker was intentional to break cultural relics, and his usual labor attitude was very bad. The people's court sentenced him to six years' imprisonment based on the above situation and suspended execution for one year. He asked: Why did Ren mingshan fabricate rumors? Where is your heart? \\n\\tLecturer Zhang Zhongpu, Jiang Lihong, Lecturer Liu Caonan, Shen Shanhao and others refuted Ren mingshan's May 19 speech in the Zhejiang Daily and the speech made at a forum on democratic parties in the province on June 7. Zhang Zhongpu said that Ren mingshan described the new China as very dark and unfree speech in the 'contested' film talk. This is a vicious slander. In this article, Ren mingshan also opposes controversy and criticism of misstatements and ideas, in fact, to abolish the party's leadership and Marxist guidance. Shen Shanhao pointed out that Ren mingshan's speech at the provincial democratic party symposium was full of abusive verbal abuse against the Communist Party and the new society, saying, 'During the past movements, comrades of the Party members have told intellectuals to 'put down their faces and put down the shelves'. In fact, intellectuals have not had many faces and shelves to put them down in eight years. Therefore, Ren mingshan said with unkindness: 'The current problem is to have party members honestly put down their faces, put down the shelves and put down the shelves and put them all together.' Ren mingshan pointed the attack to the party in this way. \\n\\tAt the meeting on the 15th, Professor Xia Chengtao criticized Ren mingshan for 'the more the Party takes care of you, the more you are proud of you, like a child'; said that Ren mingshan's propagation of reactionary fallacy is that 'ideological transformation is not complete'. Yesterday at the meeting, Sun Xizhen and Professor Hu Lunqing criticized this erroneous assertion. They believe that Ren mingshan's anti-party stance is consistent, and Xia Chengtao's statement is actually to favor the right-wing elements. \\n\\tDuring these days, the struggle of all teachers in the Chinese language faculty has been high, and many people have asked to speak. The university decided to hold a meeting of all teachers and staff this morning to voice the right-wing Ren mingshan. (Hangzhou Daily 1957,7.17)\\n"},

He has written the 'History of Chinese Phonetic History', and co-author of Guhan Tong Theory. \\nThe author has a school paper from Zhejiang Teachers College on July 30, 1957. This newspaper is a special edition of the anti-right struggle, and the first edition of the special issue is the holding of the NLD Congress, criticizing Jiang Zhenzhong and Song Yunbin, the main leaders of the Zhejiang NLD. The other three editions are criticizing Ren mingshan of the Great Right There are many forms of criticism, including articles, poems, novels, comics, but one of them is signed as 'I hate it! This article after reading Ren mingshan's 'My Remorse' is the most fierce. At that time, Ren mingshan taught in the Chinese language department. Feng Zhiappointment should be his student, and Feng's article quoted Ren mingshan's review of 'My Remorse', so from the citation in this article to Mr. Ren mingshan in Some of the words and deeds in this anti-right movement are excerpts from Feng's article:\\nRen mingshan, read your 'My Remorse', I hate it! If you really remorse, we all welcome. However, your carefully structured 'My Remorse' in the hospital bed, is so wonderful, without a little remorse. Or stick to your reactionary view and slander our righteous struggle against the right as 'there are rumors and misinformation, but also the place of slander and provocation, and physical attacks.' You deceive yourself by using 'remorse' as a smoke screen to cover up your anti-party anti-socialist words and deeds. \\n'I regret my crazy words and deeds' the beginning is so sleek and ingenious! Ren Ming-shan, your words and deeds are more than 'madness'? Your words and deeds are outright anti-socialist, but you do seem so crazy when you are attacking the party. Are you really remorse for your reactionary words and deeds as you say? No. \\nRen mingshan, are you reading the People's Daily, 'Why is this?' What do you say after waiting for a few editorials? You said at the DPG (June 26): 'I look at the People's Daily editorial, 'Why is it?'... If the People's Daily articles do well, there is a problem... for example, from a grammar point of view, the tone of the article is very bad... the anti-right editorial in the previous stage of People's Daily did not come out. Color...' We said, 'This is why' is the first gun shelled to the right, the alarm bells, it wakes up For us, we are called upon to rise to fight against the rightists. How grateful we were for it and how welcome! However, Ren mingshan, you have such a great 'disgust' to it, with the grammatical point of view to denying it, attacking it, you are so afraid of it, and you are doing everything to resist it. \\nYou said, 'Deep in my consciousness, there is a source of confrontation with the leadership of the party.' Yes, there is a root cause. But what is the root of this? Is it true, as you say, 'I am a feudal intellectualist, after eight years of learning, but not exhaustive... especially feudal intellectuals... thinking that teachers are supreme...' 'The Confucian education since Kong Meng has exaggerated the subjective world, and I have been subjected to this kind of The influence of the mind is so deep, emotionally rooted?' No. The problem isn't that simple, it's just smoke screens. Not to mention the whole country, let's talk about our Chinese language department, how many lecturers and professors have, some of them may receive a deeper education than you. The four books and five scriptures may read better than you. Why have they been transformed from 'feudal intellectuals teachers' into 'teachers of the people', all wholeheartedly dedicated his life to the cause of people's education. How respectful we are to them. And you are the feudal intellectuals, and show off yourself with the 'feudal intellectuals teacher.' You borrow attack and rain policy negates eight years of sports: 'This way, is with countless physical and mental damage in exchange, is with unpredictable emotional damage and job losses, is with some easy loss of life in exchange for' you said in the previous campaigns, 'not exactly your own words... They say the best to hide, and say that they are not good at, sometimes even feel ashamed of' A progressive face, muddled, and your heart is still hidden before liberation as Zhang Qiyun minions, feudal thoughts, reactionary thoughts of Zeng Guofan's believers, strong class feelings for their landlords family holders. liberated, he rushed Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Qiyun to Taiwan, criticized Zeng Guofan's feudal ideology, knocked down the landlord, you have resentment, Yu Yu is in your heart, and want to take advantage of the opportunity to revenge. The whole wind movement is coming, you think a good opportunity can be taken, and your class feelings really broke out frantically and rampant to attack the party. So, this is the root of your 'confrontation with the party.' \\nRen mingshan, you say, 'In the depths of emotional consciousness or the old roots entrenched', 'this emotional force is reactionary', 'and feelings have prevailed in recent years', 'because these are feelings dominate, so everything is extreme, absolute, irrational analysis and criticism.' How wonderful to say! Hollow! Abstract! It seems that your anti-socialist words and deeds are only due to 'emotional consciousness,' and your 'rational' is not so in your mind. I tell you that your bones are also anti-socialist. Is it true that, as you said, 'For eight years, he had in theory accepted Marxism Leninism, was educated and led by the party in the organization, and could hold the direction in daily work'? No, no, no! You did not accept Marxism-Leninism in theory, and you also shouted Marxism and said, 'The dialectical law of the party was right then, and this year is correct.' Not only do you not accept Party leadership and education in your organization, but also exclude the Party's education and leadership. You think that 'the party party party education also fails. If you give teachers education, the situation will be better'; you curse that the party's leadership cadres are 'outsiders' and 'beacon faces' shouting, 'outsiders cannot lead the insider'; you advocate 'Ren flower self-liberation, Ren Bird Ziming. Is it to be educated and led by the party? Are you negating the party's education and leadership, and want the democratic parties and the party chambers to resist the courtesy; you have organized a 'Democratic Party Trade Union Committee to Help Party Reception' in order to exclude party members from participating. Is it not to exclude party leaders? ...\\nRen mingshan, you say, 'My crazy words and deeds are there a power in the Lord'. What is this power? From the above analysis, it is clear that your deep marrow of anti-socialist right-wing ideas of anti-socialist right-wing ideology in the master, is making a strange. Those who have this power are by no means 'always thought to be a favorite of students and young people,' but poison the hearts of young people with the poison of the right of your 'own hobbies'. Ren mingshan, you do need to 'reborn, be human from scratch', otherwise it will indeed fall into the abyss at once...\\nStudents, we must remove the bad effects caused by Ren mingshan, and hope that the classmates who have eaten his poison will stand up to expose, criticize, and fight. We must resolutely and thoroughly repudiate Ren mingshan's right-wing words and deeds and repel the rampant attacks by right-wing elements! \\nNotes:\\nA,...\\nSecond, the citation is based on Ren mingshan's 'My Remorse' and his speeches at various meetings in the whole wind. \\n3. After the publication of the school, please give Ren mingshan a copy, so that he can smell a little bit of gunpowder in the struggle of anti-right elements in the hospital bed. \\nThrough this critical draft by Feng, I generally understand why Mr. Ren mingshan was beaten as the right: first, born in the landlord's family, had been valued by Zhang Qiyun, who fled to Taiwan (the anti-right movement, then KMT Education Minister). Origins and overseas ties are among the most valued in the movement. One of these two articles is afraid that both of these articles are in the midst of death. Second, Mr. Ren mingshan was the first deputy chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee at the time, while the anti-right movement's initial disaster-stricken area was also a democratic party; third, Mr. Ren mingshan was full of trust in the Party. When the whole wind movement began, he was naive that the party was genuinely winding, organizing a committee to help the party rectify, and actively spoke out , can even say that 'Ren Hua self-liberated, Ren Bird Zeming' such as 'anachronistic' remarks; and when the Party has decided to reverse the right, the People's Daily published 'Why is this?' Not yet awakened, or the faction of an old intellectuals refused to bow, but to give opinions on such editorial. \\nThrough the citation in the critical article of Feng, you can see that Mr. Ren mingshan in 'My Remorse' has actually been very humiliated, 'I regret my crazy words and deeds', 'I am a feudal intellectuals, eight years after learning transformation, but the old roots have not been excavated', 'Eight years in theory On the acceptance of Marxist Leninism, in The organization received the Party's education and leadership, and can hold the direction in daily work,' these words come from an old intellectuals who have an authoritative position in the field of Chinese studies. It is conceivable that under the pressure of the far left political environment, there is such a 'no Qin Wang seal' arrogant to subjugate to his heart Seeking through the movement (Mr. Ren poem: painting plum picturesque pine, with a different appearance. Love this old bone, not subject to Qin Wang Feng.)! Such a political movement distorted the movements of the soul of China's old age intellectuals. They either accepted or died. After the campaign, it could be said that China had no real intellectuals! \\nFrom Feng's article you can smell a very strong powder smell, words like arrows, sentences like a knife, have no mercy on their teachers. We cannot criticize the behavior of the critics at the time. This is also the subject of political pressure, but I saw the last sentence of Feng, 'After the school publication, please give Ren mingshan a copy, so that he can smell a little bit of gunpowder in the struggle of anti-right activists in his hospital bed.' Later still can't help but not help but also become a teacher, Feng, who has also become a teacher, has become a disgust. \\nI think the author of the article criticizing Mr. Ren mingshan in this newspaper is either Mr. Ren's student, or Mr. Ren's colleague, or may have his old friend for many years (there is also a word called 'Lu Sing' in this newspaper, and Ren mingshan's old friend also has a man named 'Lu Sing', modern lyrics (Master Hu Lu, if it's him, this ecology is really cool!), It has become a unique phenomenon to sell others in sport to preserve themselves. I recently read a three-anti-movement data from the early 1950s, which shows us not only to examine their problems, but more to advocate for expose each other between colleagues, encourage wives to expose their husbands, sons expose their fathers, hold family symposiums, and so on. The forms and practices of this kind of political movement have destroyed the basic moral foundations of benevolence, righteousness, honesty, wisdom, and letter that China has formed over the thousands of years. It undermines friendship and broke the affection! It can be said that every time a political movement has been experienced, China's moral standards will decline once, from the three to the anti-right movement, to the Fourth Qing Movement, and finally to the Cultural Revolution movement, except that political standards have completely failed to speak about social ethics, the whole society has developed to the extent that the whole society has developed to the extent that it is deceiving the ancestors! Students don't just write big print papers to criticize the master, they can beat their teachers under the slogan of politics and kill their principals under the banner of class struggles! Under the same excuses, sons can hit Lao Tzu, brunettes can insult white-haired people, couples can beat each other for their respective fronts, friends can shoot each other for leaders! When political standards are all the norms and principles of a society, no matter how noble it may be, the morality of this society must be desperate, and the society must be insane. \\nTwo more sentences related to Mr. Ram Mingshan (all of the following are from online sources): After Mr. Yen Mingshan was beaten as the right, he was denied all kinds of rights, not allowed to teach, not to publish articles, and to pay a living fee of more than 30 yuan a month, and ordered him to work in the data room. To maintain his family, he had to sell his beloved collections and monuments. However, Mr. Ren's knowledge will not be neglected because he is the right. Since the early 1960s, he was seconded to Shanghai to attend the revision of the Sea, which is one of the main authors of the word part. More illustrative of Mr. Ren's academic level is to complete the national key project 'collating the 24 history of publishing' in the 1960s. The Central Propaganda Department issued a decree to the country in August 1963, seconded eight university professors, Ren mingshan, among them, the other seven are Tang Changru of Wuhan University and Wang Zhongluo of Shandong University Lu Zhenhua, Zhang Weihua, Liu Jie of Sun Yat-sen University, Luo Jizu from Jilin University and Zheng Tianting of Nankai University. However, Mr. Ren did not know what reason he did not come to Beijing at that time. \\nMr. Ren is versatile, in classical literature, especially poems, words and compositions, is also extremely accomplished. Mr. Ren in calligraphy and seal engraving, inscription identification, he was the first professor of calligraphy lecture at Zhejiang University and Hangzhou University, and also the earliest ancient inscription in university made a demonstration. This has had a good impact on the cultural and artistic literacy of arts students. Mr. Ren calligraphy to chu characters as the foundation, Li Shu, Xiao Cai Junjia; painting is often broken plum blossoms, self-inscribed poems, fresh high In the early years, the seal engraved, 30 years old had a print book, there are more than 40 square. On Indian Studies with Han Dengan and Shamenhai. Lu Weijian, Sha Menghai, Wang Jiawu, Jiang Lihong and other Mr. used the seal, there is out of Mr. Ren's hand. \\nMr. Ren died in 1967 and died prematurely! Master of Modern Linguistics is also a colleague friend Jiang Lihong named his book 'Wairenzai' to commemorate Mr. Ren!"}

When the party proposed to carry out the wind in the wind and rain, he strongly opposes, and uses the opportunity to 'put' 'Ming' everywhere to light 'fire', incite faculty and students to oppose the Communist Party, and draw up lists privately with Wang Chengji of the School's Jiusan School and Wang Chengshou of the NLD, and organize suspicious organizations-'Help' Party rectification work committee'. Professor Sun Xizhen, lecturer Lu Moye, and Professor Shen Shanhao pointed out that Ren mingshan opposes the use of rapid storm to solve the contradictions against me, and opposes the settlement of internal contradictions within the people by wind and rain. This conspiracy is very obvious. Lu Moye said that Ren mingshan wants to take advantage of the opportunity of good winds for greater democracy, and also threatens the party, saying: The result of the wind and rain will inevitably bring 'hail'. Associate Professor Lu Weizhao said that when enlarging the song, Ren mingshan incites to say: 'It does not matter if the stick is weighing a little bit,' and we want everyone to mention the 'opinion' of a stick to death. He feared that the world was not messy, saying, 'The student is a good thing' and 'can't be rectified now, because the degree of bias is difficult to say', these remarks are vicious. He wants to beat the proletariat with a bourgeois stick, and we have to be beaten and 'patience.' Mr Kim Weicheng, representative of the Registry's team, said: When zooming up, Yen Mingshan gathered people who had been struggled in several campaigns and were dissatisfied with the party, and encouraged them to 'put' 'Ming' and said to these people: 'Do not be afraid, even though something comes to me, I am the director of the Party's rectification committee.' At the meeting, Professor Wang Jie-wu revealed that Ren mingshan argued that the Ming Fang special issue should not be led by the Party Committee, attempting to seize the action of the special issue. \\nThe spokesman also revealed that Ren mingshanzhu had cracked down on party leaders, party members and people close to the Communist Party. Kim Weicheng said that when the Academic Affairs Department added a party member cadre, Ren mingshan sarcastic behind it: 'The power of the Communist Party has been strengthened, but the work has done bad.' Li Zhifang of the Registry usually approached the Communist Party. He said that Li Zhifang was 'wires from fire in the House of the Registry', meaning 'can't touch'. Ping Huishan assistant said: Ren mingshan often slander the education of the regiment, saying that the best cadres of the team are the most likely to lie, saying that the team members are 'Vino Nuo' and 'no thought' people. Ping Hui asked Ren mingshan: Is accepting the leadership of the Party is 'Vino Noir'? \\nRen mingshan's fallacy was severely criticized at the meeting. In refuting Ren mingshan's fallacy, 'the Communist Party does not trust intellectuals' and 'it is a last resort for the Party to ask intellectuals', said: Can the Party ask him to be deputy provost and a member of the provincial CPPCC. Can you still say that the Party does not trust him? Assistant Professor Cai Yongfei said that the party's care for Ren mingshan in life and teaching is also very thoughtful. When he offered more time for scientific research, the leadership also agreed that he resigned from his post as Deputy Provost. But Ren did not do so, and in teaching, he was not only irresponsible, but spent a lot of time on ambitious activities both inside and outside the school. Xu Bukui lecturer and assistant professor Wang Yigong debunked the lie that Ren mingshan said that 'this time it was sick for the Party to destroy the body for the people.' Xu Bukui said: During the period of magnification, he went to the east and put 'fire' everywhere. As a result, could this be said to be for the Party for the people? \\nProfessor Jiang Liangfu has uncovered the despicable two-sided approach that Ren mingshan plays with. When the fourth year of the Chinese language student asked not to test modern Chinese, he said, 'I support you,' while in front of the head of the party branch, 'Modern Chinese cannot be tested.' Jiang Liangfu pointed out that this method is often used by Ren mingshan. Ren mingshan also often blows others and elevate himself. He boasted that the fourth year of the Chinese language students wrote better papers than Hang teachers and the students of the university's Chinese faculties. In fact, this was because the fourth grade of the Chinese language student was taught by him, whose aim was to combat other professors and improve themselves. \\nAt the meeting, Professor Sun Xizhen also uncovered Ren mingshan and Song Yunbin's trick of singing one peace. In the case of the Dragon Quan Tower demolition incident, although the government has given certain penalties to those responsible, Song Yunbin and Ren mingshan are still dissatisfied, saying, 'The Communist Party does not want culture and has a peasant consciousness.' It is 'Li Chuangwang'. Professor Sun Si-chun asked what purpose is Yam Ming Shin to say these words? Professor Ma Chengsheng also revealed that Ren mingshan took advantage of Longquan demolition of the tower and attacked the party in a massive manner. Ma Chengsheng said that when Ren mingshan opposed the decision to deal with the parties involved in the Longquan Tower demolition incident, it was not true that a worker in Maojiabu had been sentenced to one year's imprisonment for breaking a cultural relic. Ma Chengsheng said that the worker was intentional to break cultural relics, and his usual labor attitude was very bad. The people's court sentenced him to six years' imprisonment based on the above situation and suspended execution for one year. He asked: Why did Ren mingshan fabricate rumors? Where is your heart? \\nLecturer Zhang Zhongpu, Jiang Lihong, Lecturer Liu Caonan, Shen Shanhao and others refuted Ren mingshan's 'Conversation' in the Zhejiang Daily on May 19 and his speech at a forum on democratic parties in the province on June 7. Zhang Zhongpu said that Ren mingshan described the new China as very dark in the 'Contest Remarks' and the lack of freedom of speech. This is a vicious slander. In this article, Ren mingshan also opposes controversy and criticism of misstatements and ideas, in fact, to abolish the party's leadership and Marxist guidance. Shen Shanhao pointed out that Ren mingshan's speech at the provincial democratic party symposium was full of abusive verbal abuse against the Communist Party and the new society, saying, 'During the past movements, comrades from party members have told intellectuals to 'put down their faces and put down the shelves'. In fact, intellectuals have not had many faces and shelves for eight years.'. Therefore, Ren mingshan said with unkindness: 'The current problem is to have party members honestly put down their faces, put down the shelves and put down the shelves and put them all together.' Ren mingshan pointed the attack to the party in this way. \\nAt the meeting on the 15th, Professor Xia Chengtao criticized Ren mingshan for 'the more the Party takes care of you, the more you are proud of you, like a child'; said that Ren mingshan's propagation of reactionary fallacy is that 'ideological transformation is not complete'. Yesterday at the meeting, Sun Xizhen and Professor Hu Lunqing criticized this erroneous assertion. They believe that Ren mingshan's anti-party stance is consistent, and Xia Chengtao's statement is actually to favor the right-wing elements. \\nDuring these days, the struggle of all teachers in the Chinese language faculty has been high and many asked to speak. The university decided to hold a meeting of all teachers and staff this morning to voice the right-wing Ren mingshan. \\n(Hangzhou Daily, July 17, 1957)\\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attachment 2] Chinese three Feng's agreement: 'I hate!--After reading Ren mingshan's 'My Remorse'\\nRen mingshan, read your 'My Remorse', I hate it! If you really remorse, we all welcome. However, your carefully structured 'My Remorse' in the hospital bed is so wonderful, without a little remorse. Or stick to your reactionary view and slander our righteous struggle against the right as 'there are rumors and misinformation, but also the place of slander and provocation, and physical attacks.' You deceive yourself by using 'remorse' as a smoke screen to cover up your anti-party anti-socialist words and deeds. \\n'I regret my crazy words and deeds' the beginning is so sleek and ingenious! Ren Ming-shan, your words and deeds are more than 'madness'? Your words and deeds are outright anti-socialist, but you do seem so crazy when you are attacking the party. Are you really remorse for your reactionary words and deeds as you say? No. \\nRen mingshan, are you reading the People's Daily, 'Why is this?' What do you say after waiting for a few editorials? You said at the DPG (June 26): 'I look at the People's Daily editorial, 'Why this is'... if the People's Daily articles do well, there is a problem... for example, from a grammar point of view, the tone of the article is very bad... the anti-right editorial in the previous stage of the People's Daily is not good...' They say, 'This is why' is the first gun shelled out to the right-wing, the alarm bells, which awakens us. We are called upon to rise to fight against the right-wing elements. How grateful we were for it and how welcome! However, Ren mingshan, you have such a great 'disgust' to it, with the grammatical point of view to denying it, attacking it, you are so afraid of it, and you are doing everything to resist it. \\nYou said, 'Deep in my consciousness, there is a source of confrontation with the leadership of the party.' Yes, there is a root cause. But what is the root of this? Is it true, as you say, 'I am a feudal intellectualist, after eight years of learning, but not exhaustive... especially feudal intellectuals... thinking that teachers are supreme...' 'The Confucian education since Kong Meng has exaggerated the subjective world. Thoughts are deeply influential, emotionally rooted'? No. The problem isn't that simple, it's just smoke screens. Not to mention the whole country, let's talk about our Chinese language department, how many lecturers and professors have, some of them may receive a deeper education than you. The four books and five scriptures may read better than you. Why have they been transformed from 'feudal intellectuals teachers' into 'teachers of the people', all wholeheartedly dedicated his life to the cause of people's education. How respectful we are to them. And you are the feudal intellectuals, and show off yourself with 'feudal intellectuals teachers.' You take the approach of attack and rain negates eight years of sports: 'This way, is with countless physical and mental damage in exchange, is with unestimated emotional damage and job losses, is with some easy loss of life in exchange for' you said in the previous campaigns, 'not exactly your own words... They say the best to hide, and say that they are not good at, sometimes even feel ashamed of' A progressive face, muddled, and your heart is still hidden before liberation as Zhang Qiyun minions, feudal thoughts, reactionary thoughts of Zeng Guofan's believers, strong class feelings for their landlords family holders. liberated, he rushed Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Qiyun to Taiwan, criticized Zeng Guofan's feudal ideology, knocked down the landlord. You have resentment, Yu Yu is in your heart, and want to take advantage of the opportunity to revenge. The whole wind movement is coming, you think a good opportunity can be taken, your class feelings really broke out frantically and rampant to attack the party. So, this is the root of your 'confrontation with the party.' \\nRen mingshan, you say, 'In the depths of emotional consciousness or the old roots, this emotional power, is reactionary' and feelings have prevailed in recent years. 'Because these are susceptible to feelings, so everything is extreme, absolute, irrational analytical criticism.' How wonderful to say! Hollow! Abstract! It seems that your anti-socialist words and deeds are only due to 'emotional consciousness,' and your 'rational' is not so in your mind. I tell you that your bones are also anti-socialist. Is it true that, as you said, 'For eight years, he had in theory accepted Marxism Leninism, was educated and led by the party in the organization, and could hold the direction in daily work'? No, no, no! You did not accept Marxism-Leninism in theory, and you also shouted Marxism and said, 'The dialectical law of the party was right then, and this year is correct.' Not only do you not accept Party leadership and education in your organization, but also exclude the Party's education and leadership. You think that 'the party party party education also fails. If you give teachers education, the situation will be better'; you curse that the party's leadership cadres are 'outsiders' and 'beacon faces' shouting 'outsiders cannot lead the insider'; you advocate 'Renhua self-liberating, Ren Bird Zeming.' Is it to be educated and led by the party? Are you negating the party's education and leadership, and want the democratic parties and the party chambers to resist the courtesy; you have organized a 'Democratic Party Trade Union Committee to Help Party Reception' in order to exclude party members from participating. Is it not to exclude party leaders? \\nRen mingshan, you say, 'My crazy words and deeds are there a power in the Lord'. What is this power? From the above analysis, it is clear that your deep marrow of anti-socialist right-wing ideas of anti-socialist right-wing ideology in the master, is making a strange. Those who have this power are by no means 'always thought to be a favorite of students and young people,' but poison the hearts of young people with the poison of the right of your 'own hobbies'. Ren mingshan, you do need to 'reborn, be human from scratch', otherwise it will indeed fall into the abyss at once. ...\\nStudents, we must remove the bad effects caused by Ren mingshan, and hope that the classmates who have eaten his poison will stand up to expose, criticize and fight. We must resolutely and thoroughly repudiate Ren mingshan's right-wing words and deeds and repel the rampant attacks by right-wing elements! (July 30, 1957, 'Zhejiang Normal College')\\nNotes:\\nA,...\\nSecond, the quotation is based on Ren mingshan's 'My Remorse' and his speeches at various meetings in the wind. \\n3. After the publication of the school, please give Ren mingshan a copy, so that he can smell a little bit of gunpowder in the struggle of anti-right elements in the hospital bed. \\nThrough this critical draft by Feng, I generally understand why Mr. Ren mingshan was beaten as the right: first, born in the landlord's family, had been valued by Zhang Qiyun, who fled to Taiwan (the anti-right movement, then KMT Education Minister). Origins and overseas ties are among the most valued in the movement. One of these two articles is afraid that both of these articles are in the midst of death. Second, Mr. Ren mingshan was the first deputy chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee at the time, while the anti-right movement's initial disaster-stricken area was also a democratic party; third, Mr. Ren mingshan was full of trust in the Party. When the wind movement began, he was naive that the party was genuinely winding, organizing a committee to help the party rectify, and actively spoke out. , can even say that 'Ren Hua self-liberated, Ren Bird Zeming' such as 'anachronistic' remarks; and when the Party has decided to reverse the right, the People's Daily published 'Why is this?' Not yet awakened, or the faction of an old intellectuals refused to bow, but to give opinions on such editorial. \\nThrough the citation in the critical article of Feng, you can see that Mr. Ren mingshan in 'My Remorse' has actually been very humiliated, 'I regret my crazy words and deeds', 'I am a feudal intellectuals, eight years after learning transformation, but the old roots have not been excavated', 'Eight years in theory On accepted Marxist Leninism, received the party's education and leadership in the organization, These words come from an old intellectuals who have an authoritative position in the field of Chinese studies. Under the pressure of the far left political environment, there is such a 'not subject to the Qin Wang Feng' proud bone will also subjugate to his heart in order to pass through the movement (Mr. Ren poem: painting plum as paintings Loose, different appearance. Love this old bone, not subject to Qin Wang Feng.)! Such a political movement distorted the movements of the soul of China's old age intellectuals. They either accepted or died. After the campaign, it could be said that China had no real intellectuals! \\nFrom Feng's article you can smell a very strong powder smell, words like arrows, sentences like a knife, have no mercy on their teachers. We cannot criticize the behavior of the critics at the time. This is also the subject of political pressure, but I saw the last sentence of Feng, 'After the school publication, please give Ren mingshan a copy, so that he can smell a little bit of gunpowder in the struggle of anti-right activists in his hospital bed.' Later still can't help but not help but also become a teacher, Feng, who has also become a teacher, has become a disgust. \\nI think the author of the article criticizing Mr. Ren mingshan in this newspaper is either Mr. Ren's student, or Mr. Ren's colleague, or maybe he has many years old friends (there is also a word called 'Lu Sing' in this newspaper, and Ren mingshan's old friend also has a man named 'Lu Sing', modern lyrics. (Master Hu Lu, if it's him, this ecology is really cool!), , it can be said that every time a political movement has been experienced, China's moral standards will decline once, from the three to the anti-right movement, to the Fourth Qing Movement, and finally to the Cultural Revolution movement, except that political standards have completely disspoken of social ethics, the whole society has developed to the extent that deceiving the ancestors! Students don't just write big prints to criticize the masters, they can beat their teachers under the slogan of politics and kill their principals under the banner of class struggle! Under the same excuses, sons can hit Lao Tzu, brunettes can insult white-haired people, couples can beat each other for their respective fronts, friends can shoot each other for leaders! When political standards are all the norms and principles of a society, no matter how noble it may be, the morality of this society must be desperate, and the society must be insane. \\nTwo more sentences related to Mr. Ram Mingshan (all of the following are from online sources): After Mr. Yen Mingshan was beaten as the right, he was denied all kinds of rights, not allowed to teach, not to publish articles, and to pay a living fee of more than 30 yuan a month, and ordered him to work in the data room. To maintain his family, he had to sell his beloved collections and monuments. However, Mr. Ren's knowledge will not be neglected because he is the right. Since the early 1960s, he was seconded to Shanghai to attend the revision of the Sea, which is one of the main authors of the word part. More illustrative of Mr. Ren's academic level is to complete the national key project 'collating the 24 history of publishing' in the 1960s. The Central Propaganda Department issued a decree to the country in August 1963, seconded eight university professors, Ren mingshan, among them, the other seven are Tang Changru of Wuhan University and Wang Zhongluo of Shandong University Lu Zhenhua, Zhang Weihua, Liu Jieh of Sun Yat-sen University, Luo Jizu from Jilin University and Zheng Tianting of Nankai University. However, Mr. Ren did not know what reason he did not come to Beijing at that time. \\nMr. Ren is versatile, in classical literature, especially poems, words and compositions, is also extremely accomplished. Mr. Ren in calligraphy and seal engraving, inscription identification, he was the first professor of calligraphy lecture at Zhejiang University and Hangzhou University, also the earliest ancient monuments in university. made a demonstration. This has had a good impact on the cultural and artistic literacy of arts students. Mr. Ren calligraphy to chu characters as the foundation, Li Shu, Xiao Cai Junjia; painting is often broken plum blossoms, self-inscribed poems, fresh high In the early years, the seal engraved, 30 years old had a print book, there are more than 40 square. On Indian Studies with Han Dengan and Shamenhai. Lu Weijian, Sha Menghai, Wang Jiawu, Jiang Lihong and other Mr. used the print, there is out of Mr. Ren's hand. \\nMr. Ren died in 1967 and died prematurely! Master of Modern Linguistics is also a colleague friend Jiang Lihong named his book 'Wairenzai' to commemorate Mr. Ren! \\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached 3] Wang Yuanhua: 'Remnant Ming' ('Caixin Network' June 26, 2006)\\nPeople are not entirely shaped by moral norms, and act according to rational domination. People are complex, and human sexuality can sometimes break through the fence of reason. \\nMr. Ren mingshan, Zixin Uncle, Jiangsu Rugao Shuangdian. Zeng Shi from Zhong Tai, Xu Ang, Xia Chengtao and other Sinology everyone. Early years to rule text, sound rhythm, training of learning, after specializing in scripture. The war of resistance broke out, Zhijiang University moved to Shanghai Concession and leased several houses as classrooms in Tsz Shu Building. Mr. Ren Zhijiang Chinese lecturer. At that time our family fled to Shanghai soon, my mother feared that I would be deserted to study, through Professor Hu Lusheng, Provost of Zhijiang, asked Mr. Ren to teach me Chinese. I am three times a week at Mr. Residence for an hour of class. \\nI went to visit Mr. Ren for the first time, and he was wearing a robe, not tall, and dearly. His life was simple, with only a few pieces of wooden furniture and a rattan chair for rest. Every time I went to his house, he sat at the desk and had never been idle. In my contact with him, he never seemed to laugh. He taught me three courses, 'Talking Text', 'Zhuang Zi' and 'New Language' for about a year before and after a year. 'Speak text word' one word one word in order; 'Zhuang Zi' is a collection of Guo Qingfan; 'The world speaks new language' is what he designated me to read. Mr. Ren speaks with great attention, the sound is bright, although only I am alone, he also used the same loud voice to explain to me. \\nMr. Ren is a serious person, and he has criticized me several times. At that time, I was busy with anti-Japanese rescue work. Mr. Ren's classes were often late, sometimes absent, and Mr. Ren was very angry. On one occasion, because I didn't go to class, he ran to my house, leaving a note saying he was 'not waiting for a long time' and asked me why I didn't take leave in advance. I was blamed by my mother, and I did not apologize to him, despite some dismay in my heart. Years later, every thought of this matter, his wasting face, two strong eyes, and a bright voice, will appear before me, making me not desolate and slacking. \\nAt that time I read left-leaning books, I thought I had mastered the 'consciousness of going forward,' and sometimes published small articles in the newspaper. I have picked a few articles for Mr. Ren to see. After reading, he said coldly, 'I can't write.' Then, 'Your article is impatient and bad.' After a few days, Mr. Ren showed me his student essay. I remember an essay book depicting the lake landscape, with sentences such as 'far mountains to come', Mr. Ren added a circle point next to the testimonials. Before that, I did not know what 'culture' is, after Mr. Ren's point dial, began to understand a little. In the late 1990s, Qian Gang compiled an academic chronology for me, saying that my focus on culture stems from Mr. Ren's teachings, which means that. \\nMr. Ren's life was bumpy and was designated as 'extreme right' on the right, because of the encouragement of students to take the 'white college road'. He was deprived of all his rights, not allowed to teach, publish articles and to pay only monthly maintenance. To maintain his family, he had to sell his beloved books and monuments. After 'anti-right', most of his academic papers could not be published except for the brief easing period of 61 years (such as the 'Three Scriptures of Scripture' for the Chinese History Series). Luckily Mr. Xia Shing Tao's own name was published in the press, and he received some fees to subsidize his household. 'Cultural Revolution' erupted, Mr. Ren has suffered from liver cancer. The following year, finally Yu Yu Yu, there are four in the spring and autumn 50. \\nOn: Zhang taiyan taste clouds, scitters flint mirror, sweeper evil rope. Therefore, loyal words are often thrown away, and it is not acceptable for society to go straight. Whoo! Mr. Ren has both, how can we not fall into a tragic situation? His professionalism is awe-inspiring. He is also unjustifiable to him in his straightforward direction. But I think sometimes, is he too persistent in the world? Some years ago, people heard that in the early fifties, Mr. Ren was a provost at a university, wanted to do the teaching work well, disciplined, and also to ask others with the same standards. He went to listen to others while attending classes and found that the explanation was wrong, he could not help but stand up and speak out, causing embarrassment to the other. I believe that Mr. Ren has done so without the slightest expression and derogatory elements of others. However, he was too eager to do so, too little consideration. \\nRecently read Zhu Yixin 'No Evil Tang Q&A', and talked about the problem. The Unwicked Church believes that people must be taken up with peace, and take care of themselves, and be in parallel with the broke. And he said, 'If you will take care of the man, then all the thorns are in touch.' 'No Evil Hall Q&A' book more insightful opinions, convincing, the above quoted these words are also good. But no evil is a scientist, and does not pay much attention to the sexual aspects of human nature. and act according to rational domination. People are complex, human sexuality sometimes breaks through the barriers of reason, and human virtues can sometimes be mixed with certain negative factors. Therefore, while people should work towards the best of good, no one can really do it. \\nIt is inevitable that Mr. Ren has pointed out that 'he will care for people' disease, but I also think that if this factor is removed, he is expected to be the same as the light, and go on with the world, then I am afraid it will disappear in his body with integrity and professionalism, because certain defects are often mixed with virtue. This is the character generated, difficult to decompose, to remove this aspect, often that aspect is no longer there. I'm afraid that this is one of the reasons for many troubles and tragedies. Mr. Ren is also hard to escape this number."}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】Cloud: 'Kang Tibet Austrian Tibetan Ren naiqiang' (Cultural Figures of Modern Sichuan Culture)\\nIn 1978, after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Ren naiqiang removed the 'right' and 'learning valve' hats and the grievances were thoroughly clarified. He has served as a fourth and fifth member of the CPPCC Sichuan Province, Special Fellow of the Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences, Invited Professor of the Southwest Institute for Nationalities, Director of the Chinese Ethnic Research Society, Consultant of the Chinese Society of Ethnic History, Sichuan Institute of Ethnic Studies, Consultant of Sichuan Ancient Books Finishing Planning Group, Sichuan Province Special Librarian of the Institute of Literature and History, Special Editor of Sichuan Local Magazine and more than 30 places, cities, states and counties Compilation of Chi, consultant. Ren naiqiang, a famous scholar who has lived through the three times of the Qing Dynasty, the Republic of the Republic and the New China, has always loved the Party and the people, devoting his lifelong energy and wisdom to the cause of scientific research in the motherland, leaving us an academic legacy of more than thousands of words. His legendary life fully embodies the excellent quality of patriotic, realistic, hard-working, perseverance, perseverance, integrity, and a valuable spiritual wealth worth drawing and cherishing. \\nRen naiqiang, the word restaurant, 1894 was born in Shuanggui Township, Nanchong County, Sichuan, in the early March of 1894. The first prefectural primary school at the age of 11 in Kawakita. He graduated from the middle school in 1915 and received the financial assistance of seven people, including Zhang Lan, principal of Nanchong Middle School and teacher Lu Zihe. After graduating from university in 1920, he worked at the Beijing Morning News Hall. He returned to Nanchong in 1921 with Zhang Lan to assist Zhang's local autonomy. The so-called local self-government is the activity of some patriotic intellectuals following the May 4, demanding the establishment of local self-government institutions to manage local affairs in order to oppose feudal authoritarianism and warlords. At that time, Tan Yan, Kuo advocated provincial autonomy in Hunan, Zhang Jizhi advocated county autonomy in Nantong and Song Desheng in Wuxi, and Yanyang Chu and Liang Shuming conducted rural autonomy in Ding County and Zouping. The autonomy of Nanchong County by Zhang Lan is the starting point of opening up from county autonomy to provincial autonomy. The main tasks are vocational education and the development of the local economy. While studying in Beiping's agricultural college, Ren has visited the professional education of Huang Yanpei, Zhang Jizhi, Rong Desheng and other places in Shanghai and Nantong, and other places where they are more effective and influential, as well as factories focusing on the development of cotton yarn and textile industries. After returning to the county in 1921, he took office as Director of Industrial Affairs Bureau of Nanchong County and Dean of County High School. In order to promote local autonomy, he spent more than half a year visiting Shanghai, Nantong, Wuxi and other places, and proposed two autonomous plans, combining the actual practice, to make use of silk weaving and making use of the family's ability to raise silkworm in Nanchong area. Congress cable tradition, for further development p II is the development of tung oil industry, Ren naiqiang after Wanxian, Wuhan and After a survey on the export industry of tung oil in Shanghai, it was found that Tongbo is very savory in the international market and is an important commodity for China's export, and the natural conditions in Nanchong are suitable for the growth of tung trees, and there is a great deal to develop the tung oil industry. However, in order to set up these two undertakings, professional education is set up under the support of Zhang Lan, and silk classes, craft classes, medical classes and teacher training classes in Nanchong High School. In view of the lack of interest in silk and craftsmanship, Ren naiqiangsui resigned as a teaching director of the silk class, so that the class jumped to the top of the school after graduation. At the same time, Ren naiqiang also founded the 'Bi-Monthly Journal of Industry' as the official publication of the Bureau. He combines writing, editing, illustrations, typography and distribution. The publication was of high quality, cheap and large circulation, and it had no small role in correcting social prejudices and forming correct public opinion for five years. It was never released until Ren naiqiang resigned as Director of Industry in 1926. \\nIn 1926, Zhang Lan became President of Chengdu University and was interested in inviting Naiqiang to work in Rong. However, Qin Shufeng, who succeeded the principal of the Nanchong Middle School, pleaded him to return to work in He was interested in studying the historical geography of Sichuan at that time, he proposed that four counties must allow them to open a 'rural construction' class as a condition, and that Qin Shufeng was willing to apply back to the county. After careful coaching, Ren naiqiang has written the book 'History of Sichuan', which grew up to hundreds of thousands of words. From the geology of the Sichuan Basin, it covers the characteristics and changes of Sichuan's history, geography and so on. praise. Sichuan Rural Construction Institute has been used as teaching materials, and other universities have followed suit. In 1927, the Nanchong County Government wrote County Chi, the author has many talents and lifted people, and is unable to do anything related to geographical knowledge. He was responsible for compiling regional, history, mountain system, water system, towns, agriculture and so on. He was not satisfied in the preparation of the collection of ready-made information from his predecessors. Most of the materials used had gone through his own field surveys and surveys, and prepared the new wind of Fang Zhi, and was hailed by Zhang Lan as 'the poor of a man before washing'. \\nRen naiqiang was also rushed to Jialing High School to teach in Jialing High School, and he found that the population problems in Sichuan Province were serious, and he found that the population problems in Sichuan province were serious, and he had historically been in Jin, Song and Ming Mate, because warlord Rozechou occupied Nanchong during the reproduction of the county, hate progress and innovation. Subsequent problems of overpopulation resulting from unrest, ranging from the end of the Ming to the Republic of 300 Over the years, the basin population has grown to the point of overcrowding, while the river is scarce and the soil climate is pleasant, both beneficial to development and the solution of the problem of overpopulation in the basin, decided to leave the land and work on the river side. \\nSince Liu Wenhui annexed the vast ground in Sichuan in 1926 and was appointed General Commander of Chuan Kang Border Guard, Liu set up the Border Affairs Department and the Border Policy Research Institute to seek talents and develop the river side. Ren naiqiang Sui was appointed by 31j Wenhui as an inspector of Chuanhang area by 31j Wenhui. Beard gave him 200 yuan of ocean funds and assigned two students from the Border Training Institute as aides to accompany him from Kamikawa south area into the Kawa-Yasu Plateau for over a year long field expedition. Ren naiqiang and his party walked through the rural areas and farms of Luding, Kangding, Danqi, Daofu, Luhuo, Ganzi, Tian Huo, Litang, Yajiang and other counties. For a detailed study, a diary is written daily, and a comprehensive study report is written by county by county, and a map is attached. Services. At that time, the mapping map lacked advanced scientific measuring instruments. Only a barometer with coarse altitude and a compass s barometer were used to measure the relevant values only in step. However, the map so mapped would have been based on the accuracy of the map subsequently measured by the Land Survey. See the practical, deep strength of Ren's research. The results were also recognized and appreciated by Beard Ang and Liu Wenhui. \\nDuring his field trip, Ren not only saw the favorable economic development conditions of Kawanbe, which had great hope for solving the problem of population expansion in the basin, but also aroused his interest in the social history, religion, culture and living habits of the Tibetans, and aroused a strong desire for research. It also set the determination of Wang to specialize in Kangzang history research and economic development in Kawanabe. However, because they do not understand Tibetan Tibetan language, in order to work in the future, he married Luo Zhe, a Tibetan girl who was in the first place of the word, was in love for his wife. As of 1936, Ren naiqiang was a member of the construction of Xikang province. She was an interpreter for all matters of contact with Han Tibet, and all social activities could be handled by her, and Ren naiqiang sui was able to focus on academic research. Later Ren held a Kang Tibetan research class, and Luo Zhe went for many ways to manage the accounts. Luo Zhe also enthralled several toasts for Liu Wenhui. Liu gave her a reward in the name of Xuanhua. In 1948, Luo Zhe was nominated by Liu Wenhui as a representative of the National Congress, and would die in July 1949 due to the recurrence of old diseases after the return to rong in Nanjing, and died in July 1949. Ren naiqiang was saddened by closing the Kangzang Research Institute and sent mourning. \\nAfter Ren naiqiang returned from the river in 1929, Liu Wenhui abandoned his reclamation plan and hired Ren as a member of the Ministry's Economic Construction Committee to prepare for the economic construction of the county in the basins due to the unstable ground. However, the former official of the unit has a strong habit, and his colleagues do not work for politics in their position. Ren is a useless place for research and writing every day. The book 'Si Kang in' was written at that time, within the three volumes of 'territory', 'land language', 'folk' and 'folk', with dozens of maps he personally surveyed, filling the gap in the study of Kangtibetan history in China. It also caused a strong reaction in foreign history circles, hailed as the 'best of the edge of the ground' Chi 'and 'open Kangzang research pioneer.' Soon, Ren naiqiang once again asked to go out to study the industrial situation in South Sichuan. He: From the waterway down the river to Pengshan, Danzhou, Qingshen, Jiading, Jiajiang, Hongya, Danleng, Pujiang. Thanks to Liu Wenhui's support, it is very convenient for county governors and directors of industry along the way. As well as Pujiang, he had to return to seek medical treatment for months due to disease and spit blood. After two times south, take the road, from Huayang, Renshou, Jingyan, Rong County, Weiyuan, Neijiang, Anyue, and finally arrived in Nanchong, his home town. If he finds that there are a large number of Tong Shan on both sides of the Tao River, he is deeply pity to make recommendations to the Construction Committee, advocating for extensive afforestation, while saplings will be set up by nursery in Neijiang. It was also very inconvenient to find that jiaojiang folk weaving, 'Narrow cloth fly has become a special-selling commodity in ethnic minority areas, and that it does not produce cotton locally, and raw materials are purchased from Renshou. Ren's study found that the geology and climate in the area of Jiaojiang and Emei are perfectly suitable for cotton growth. Therefore, the two places should be adapted to the local conditions of a wide range of cotton. After the review of the above two proposals, Liu Wenhui immediately instructed the agencies to implement them. \\nLiu Wenhui's Transportation Office has a Transport Committee, and the Economic Construction Committee is also merged, and there are other electrical appliances and general affairs offices. In view of the weight of Ren naiqiang, Liu Wenhui indicated that Director of Transportation Lan should reuse Ren naiqiang, and Lan gave him the post of Chief of General Affairs. Liu also asked him to be the director of the cotton field and praised him in person, saying, 'No more solid people like you can find.' Liu Wenhui also asked Ren naiqiang: 'Some people from the Construction Commission have suggested that traffic cannot be controlled by construction, and construction should manage traffic. The Director of Transport echoes the Director of the Construction Division so that the Commission can be merged. That is right?' Ren naiqiang replied unequivocally: 'There is a precedent in the construction of traffic control. Japan oversees transportation and construction in the name of 'Co., Ltd.' in the name of the South, while Britain also uses the East India Corporation, a railway construction agency, to lead the construction of India. 'It is precisely for the new places to open up traffic before we can push forward economic construction,' he said. Transportation is the first thing, so it can lead the construction.' A reasonable and well-founded talk makes Liu Xinyue sincerely obedience. Ren has been working in Liu Wenhui's military department (traffic office is located in Liu's 24 military department). \\nIn the winter of 1932, Liu Wenhui was defeated by the coalition forces such as Liu Xiang, Deng Xihou and Tian Songyao, and withdrew from Hanyuan. However, his ideal ambitions remain unchanged, while continuing to write and revise the 'Xikangtu' (at this time the first part has been printed), while preparing to return to his hometown of Nanchong for a visit. Soon at the invitation of Zhang Lan, he went to Guangxi and other southern China provinces in the spring of 1933. To the mountain city of Chongqing, is discouraged by Liu Xiang. Liu, as chairman of the Sichuan provincial government and director of the Sichuan Kang Pacification Office, is preparing to hold a conference on educational reform, because he saw Ren naiqiang an article on the reform of education in Sichuan in the New Shu newspaper, which advocates the training of talents and reforming old education from various aspects of the system, teaching materials and teaching methods. The idea of combining classrooms and field internships is very interesting. Therefore, Zirin has stayed to participate in the above-mentioned reform he presided over. Meetings. Ren naiqiang was invited to prepare a reform plan for Liu Xiang's Education Reform Promotion Committee. The members then met to discuss the specific rules for the implementation of the program, and Ren was allowed to leave the country. He went to Guangxi with Zhang Lan and other Shanghai to visit the local autonomy carried out by Li Zongren and Bai Zongxi for a longer period of time. Cyclone disease only went to Nanyue Hengshan for medical treatment, and returned to the river via Hunan after he became a book entitled 'Travels outside the Gap', which introduced monuments, customs and social phenomena along the trip, which was published in Shanghai and Chongqing newspapers. \\nAfter Ren returned to Chuan, he was appointed a professor and director of the farm at Chongqing University. Since Shapingba was still a wasteland, he used his spare time to launch people to plant flowers and trees, create grassy gardens and leveling out new building foundations. Today, Shapingba is tree-lined with tall buildings and a prosperous scene. Who knows that the original founders and pioneers of this cultural district are Ren naiqiang? \\nAt the beginning of 1934, Lemongjiu, who returned home in Japan, became the dean of the Agricultural College, in the name of Ren naiqiang, and repeatedly hired him to teach at the College Due to the gap between the two school principals, soon resigned to the countryside, and continued to complete the writing of the 'Xikangtu' giant book, and he was referred to Jiangan Provincial Third School School Principal. He operated bleak during his term of office, leading by example, the school style was 33 changed, famous; still known for the new students of that year. \\nIn 1935, after Ren naiqiang published the 'Economic Geography of Sichuan' article in Geography, Geographer Weng Literature Teca recommended, and proposed that Ren be rewritten as 'Sichuan Social, Economic and Industrial Allocation', and published in Geographer Zhang Qi to the editor-in-chief of the Geography Journal, was well received by the Kuomintang Central Research Institute. In the autumn of the same year, Ren naiqiang was appointed by the National Government as a member of the Xikangjian Provincial Committee. First, since the Second Liu War, Liu Wenhui defeated Xikang, although still retaining the name of the general command of border guards, but some of them were sporadic and financial support was difficult to do. The Kuomintang Central Party sent Huang Musong as a special envoy in Tibet, and asked Liu Wenhui to propose a defense plan for the consolidation of border guards and grant funding. Liu turned to Ren naiqiang, and Ren's aid pen and then received sympathy from the Chinese people and funding from the Central Committee, and decided to visit the river to operate in person. Only because he was a major teaching at that time, he was unable to go to work with Liu.\\nStart to pay off the fenghs, so recommend to the Central Committee. Ren sentiment Liu Wenhui met the long, determined to go home to Kang, while the Provincial Committee was based in Ya'an, and later moved to Kangding. Ren's jealousy crowded by repeated recruitment of old-school figures such as Yang Shuming and other jealousy, is dedicated to writing. He also served as deputy director of Xikang County Training Institute for political personnel and taught the course 'Kangzang History Land', which was greatly appreciated by the students. This was again framed by Al-Shabaab people in Saikon Province. Ren naiqiangsu has no political ambitions, and at this point he is deeply strained and focused on academic research. He took advantage of the position of Xikangjian Provincial Committee, or sent a number of visits to places he had not been involved in the past, or commissioned county staff to provide field information, translate Tibetan history, and sometimes went to the horse. By 1942, he had more extensive research in Tibetan studies, and published many papers and works. For example, 'Tibetan History of Politics and Politics' completed in cooperation with Liu Liqian (Translation Liu, Ren Examination); published 'Outline of the History of Kangzang', 'Two Versions'; Written by Fang Zhi Historical Materials and Articles 'Tubo Cong Expedition', 'Luding Tour Guide', 'Xikang XI County Expedition Report', 'Tianlu Bao' Songzan Dry Cloth Year Spectrum, as well as 'Ta Chan Genetic Spectrum', have been published in the 'Kang Dao Monthly' and 'Xikang Daily'. , 'Ningyuan Daily', 'Western Daily' and other newspapers. Ren naiqiang also presided over the excavation of Lushan Han stone tomb group such as Yuhui coffin, Fan Minbei and other articles, including 'Lushan Hanshi Tu Exam', 'Fanmin Inscriptions', and 'Defending Wang Hui Sar His detailed examination of the cultural relics and the relationship between the people of the Tsing Yi River basin and Chinese culture in the Han Dynasty caused a sensation in the archaeological circles at home and abroad. Guo Mouruo said that 'the art is full of art' and believes that Michelangelo's sculptures from the European Renaissance are not comparable. Ren naiqiang became the only scholar at the time of the Chuan Kang border. Once published, his papers will be valued by scholars at home and abroad, and famous foreign Tibetan scholars Shi Taian and David Neil have all pushed their research results very much. \\nRen naiqiang's two trips to Xikang felt the cruelty of the local 'Ura system' (referring to the various forms of misservitude, including human servitude and livestock, that serfs in the old Tibetan region were a heavy burden of serfs. In order to solve the transportation problem, he proposed the establishment of a pastoral transport company. On the North-South transportation line, the site operates state-owned pastoral stations, with pastures, that is, with their livestock carriers for commercial goods and consignments, only 60 miles each way, so that people and animals are not tired, and the transportation is convenient, known as the joint transportation plan of the pastoral station. Liu Wenhui Celebrates\\nIn this case, a special allocation of 100,000 yuan was appointed as a member and manager of the province. In order to train managers, Ren's first conducted a pastoral transport training course. After graduation, the personnel were assigned to various counties to promote pastoralism and prepare pastoral stations. He personally surveyed the deployment, selected sites, bought livestock, built grazing stations, first running North Road, and others. For this reason, he has finally opened up the toughest area from Kangding to Dow Fu. However, at this time, the provincial party department headed by Chiang Kai-shek agent, Ye Xiufeng, began to force Ren naiqiang to receive the company. Liu Wenhui also helped Ren naiqiang to resist relations. In 1939, the Xikang provincial government was established. Ye Xiufeng was the director of the construction department. He received the pastoral transportation company by power, and the assets of more than a dozen pastoral stations were misappropriated and clean, and the ancient and brutal Urla system was restored. \\nAfter the establishment of the government of Xikang Province, Ren naiqiang was crowded by Jiang's figures and lost their jobs again, and had to prepare to return to the river. Liu Wenhui sent a person to Luding, and finally retained, and appointed as the chairman of the preparatory committee of the Tongzhi Museum in Xikang Province. He has since been dedicated to writing the first 'Xikang Tongzhi', and he himself wrote the 'Xikang Zhi Outline'. In 1941, Liu Wenhui, from Kang Ding to Ya'an, offered various training courses and invited Naiqiang to teach the 'History of Kangzang' course. Ren naiqiang took the opportunity to relocate the 'Xikang Provincial Tongzhi Museum Preparatory Committee' to Ya'an and renamed 'Xikang Provincial Tsuchi Museum'. In 1943, the Department of Civil Affairs of the Sichuan Provincial Government sent a person to take over the Tongzhi Hall. Ren Kang had failed. Liu Wenhui sent another person to receive the museum, Ren naiqiang sui was unemployed for the third time. 'After three months of leisure, Jinling, Yanjing, Qilu, Mingxian and West China Universities integrated their academic activities on frontier research, and sent letters to him to attend the conference to lecture and relocate his family to the branch. He is a professor and researcher at the Western China Frontier Research Institute, chaired by Li Anzhu. In 1944, Li Anzhai wanted to copy the Tibetan Scripture via Xikang to Dege, and invited Naiqiang to join Kangzang for the third time. Li Anzhai returned to school first, while Ren naiqiang went from Dege to Changtai grassland and back to Kangding, and then went to Mianning, Xichang and Yuexi Zhuzhu counties. In Xichang issued the 'Wu Hou South Exam'. He did not return to West China University until the eve of the Spring Festival in 1945. At this time, he is energetic and energetic, focusing on Kang, Qing, Tibetan history and geography. It has written 'About the Kingdom of Tibet', 'Genetic Spectrum of Toast', 'Lama Teaching and Xikang Politics', 'The Weird Records of Xikang', 'Introduction to the Epic Epic of Gesar', and the evolution of the Kang Tibetan toast system and the Lama Teach development, presents many fresh and unique insights. He pioneered the introduction of 'King Gesar', the world's longest narrative poem, and pioneered the findings of Gesar, the ancestors of the lush toast and Song's 'Horn', which is still based in the academic community at home and abroad. \\nAfter his return to Rong, Ren opened 'Reclamation Studies' in China University and Chuan University and taught 'Cultural Geography' at the Oriental Institute of Literature and Education. After he urged him to hire him as a full-time professor at the College of Agriculture, he offered courses such as 'Economic Geography of Agriculture', 'History of China's Agriculture', 'Reclamation Studies' and 'Agricultural Promotion'. During this period, he organized a 'Kangzang Research Course' and launched the monthly magazine 'Kangzang Research' and made valuable contributions to Tibetan studies in China. At the same time, he created a long chapter of the Peasant Revolution, 'Zhang Xianzhong's Faithful Record' (also known as 'Zhang Xianzhong'), one hundred times, while supporting dozens of articles in various newspapers, was prolific and became the most prestigious professor at the time of Sichuan University. In 1946, Ren joined the China Democratic League at Cihuitang, Chengdu, and actively followed Zhang Lan and Zhang Zhi and carried out the work of the NLD. \\nThe liberation of Sichuan in late 1949. In early January of the following year, he sent Deputy Chief of Staff Lee Kefu to visit Ren naiqiang at Chuan University. After the meeting, Likov said to him: 'My first field army was charged with the task of liberating Tibet. I heard Mr. Ren wrote a lot of books about Tibet.' Yam Nai-keung was pleased to extend guests to the home of Fan Department Street. At this time, at the invitation of Gu EGang's China Map Company, he began to draw the Tibetan land. He has completed two thirds of the Tibetan land. In addition, in 1943, when he visited Chuanzang, the full map of Kang Tibetan standard and a map of the Xikang counties were drawn into a full picture of Kangzang as well as a map of the Xikang counties. Appreciation, I borrowed some material books. He met with He Long, Li Jingquan, Hu Yaobang, Liao Zhigao and Li Dazhang, and began talks on Tibetan history and its march route. Ren naiqiang said that he had made a strong and firm opinion on the issue of the entry into Tibet. He proposed four marching routes: one is Batang; second, Dege; third is Deng ke; four is Qinghai Yushu, it is recommended that it is best to go hand in hand, put the main main on Dege all the way. Because there are 11 Daibens in Tibet, 10 of which are in Qamdo, which can both increase the momentum and disperse the resistance of Qamdo and reduce pressure on the main army to enter Qamdo. After defeating the Tibetan army to capture Qamdu, the entry should be suspended in order to prevent the Dalai from fleeing. Since the siege by force is the military law, people should be sent to consult the peaceful liberation party as a whole. Ren naiqiang also suggested that Qinghai Yushu all the way to use light cavalry, one person prepared 2-3 horses, God quickly entered Lhasa and Qushui, in order to break down the road behind the Qandu, in order to prevent the Qandu Tibetans from fleeing India This is due to the prospects put forward by Tibetans when the Kuomintang army attacked Tibet that they could not resist the historical facts of a large number of Chinese pro-British traitors. Ren also pointed out the importance of respect for the customs and customs of the Disc people in the liberation of Tibet and stressed that the protection of temples and the unity of monks must be considered as a matter of paramount importance. After Ren's reference to Liu Wenhui's defeat in Kangding, led by Liu Xiang in the 'Battle of Yaskawa' that year, he used the 'Hongyang Dharma' method to stabilize their feet, and the case of the resurgence of Dongshan was very convincing. He said, 'Yes, yes, we must protect the temple and declare freedom of belief. This is by no means expedient, but our party's consistent policy.' He also allocated more than 40 engineering and technicians from Hu Zongshang's recently received survey team and Sichuan Survey Bureau to Ren naiqiang for use, urging him to immediately complete the preparation of the Tibet map. Ren, who admired the generosity of the Communist Party, was pleased that he had the opportunity to work for the liberation of the motherland. He immediately selected six people from two surveying teams to draw a 500,000 maps of Kangzang in his own home, while the rest remained in the original survey bureau of the Imperial City. After more than 20 days and nights, the road map of 200,000 parts from Batang to Lhasa and Shigatse was completed. He long was delighted and instructed to pay the print immediately and distribute the troops. And called Zhang Guohua, who had the task of entering Tibet, on behalf of Ye Ye, to dinner Ren naiqiang. In 1981, when Tibet celebrated the 30th anniversary of its peaceful liberation, Ren naiqiang wrote an article entitled 'Remembrance to the boss on the liberation of Tibet'. \\nRen naiqiang was appointed a member of the Southwest Ethnic Affairs Committee to participate in the preparation for the establishment of the Southwest Institute for Nationalities. 1957 misclassified as the right, subject to\\nBy unfair treatment, the election was still forced to reform labor at the end of the election. However, he has always loved the Party and the people, believes in the Party's policy and never interrupts his research work. He has completed a number of books such as 'Sichuan Kangzang Agricultural Divisions', 'Sichuan State History Map', 'Sichuan Warlords Melee Map' and 'Sichuan Historical Map', and became a necessary reference book to study the history of Sichuan. After 1960, he completed the 1.5 million words 'Huayang Guozhi School Remarks', which he spent more than 30 years and published by Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House in 1988. According to the 'Huayang Guozhi' was placed more than 1,700 years ago in Sichuan Changbo, an important ancient book about the southwestern part of China, and is now one of the earliest places with high historical value in China. It writes the history and geography of Jindailiang, Yi and Ningxia, including the three provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, southern Gansu, southern Shaanxi, and northwest Hubei. With this book to Southern Song, Song Ning Zong Jiatai (1203 years), supplemented 12 volumes by Li Ji, due to more than 700 years of misrepresentation, more than 900 years of engraved duffle, there has not been a perfect final version. Ren's based on the book of Liao Yin Ching people, read more than 30 editions that can be collected, as well as a large number of related literature, remittance correction, supplementation, interpre"},

Since Ren is very familiar with historical sites in southwest China, and has deep knowledge of national studies and natural science, he said, he said, he said. He said that his book hooks were disguised, and his predecessors said that it was very difficult to be valued by academic circles at home and abroad. Los Angeles, the Tribune on September 30, 1988 comments: 'Huayang Guozhi School Remarks' is the most accurate note of Fang Zhi school, known as the encyclopedia of ancient history in southwest. 'Mr. Ren naiqiang this book can be called the final version of Huayang Guozhi',' said Qian Bocheng, editor-in-chief of Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House. \\nAs said at the beginning of this article, Ren naiqiang, after the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Communist Party of China (CPC), has been in his 80s years of age and held a number of positions, and continues to devote superhuman energy to academic research and guidance. He usurped three drafts of Zhao Erfeng, Liu Zanting's 'Thirty Years of Journey to Tibet' and Futilin's 'Tibet Construction of the Province' into a book, which provided useful documents for the study of the issue of Kang Tibet. At the same time, historical geography and geological prospecting have been written in two volumes of 'Golden Fish Mining' and 'Gold in Sichuan' to make a positive contribution to the development of gold resources in the Kangqing Plateau. The second book totalled about 400,000 words. Yang Chao was transferred to the hands of Vice Premier Wang Zhen, vice-premier of the State Council in charge of the work, under the attention of General Luo Ruiqing, a student of Ren naiqiang that year. Yu wrote a passionate handwritten letter to Ren Shi and immediately reported the gold mining to the Central Committee for approval, and set up a special gold force in Sichuan. Central Ministry of Metallurgical Industry appointed Nai Qiang as Gold Consultant. Later, according to Ren's remarks, Sichuan gold troops discovered some medium and large gold deposits in Baishui and Ganzi prefectures. \\nSince 1979, Ren naiqiang has completed 'Qiang origin flow exploration', 'new exploration of the ancient history of Sichuan', 'compilation of historical data in Sichuan Tibet area', 'Zhou poetry new interpretation', 'new exploration of mountain and sea', 'Sichuan geographical name examination', 'interpretation of geographical names in eight counties in Ya'an region', 'I on new' Xiushina County Zhi's Insight, Chinese Official Manual, Zhang Xianzhong More than a dozen writings and dozens of papers are about 5 million words. 'Exploration of Qiang origin flow' is both a pioneering monograph studying the history of the Qiang ethnic group and the first monograph to answer historically the history of the formation of the multi-ethnic family in China, starting with a single nation. With more than one million words, 'Zhou Poetry Xinchuan', using dialectical materialism and historical materialism methods, detailed analysis of the '300 poems', and the study of the social and historical background reflected in each article, is not fixed by the old scriptures in history. The road. Ren naiqiang's history chapter back to the novel 'Zhang Xianzhong' is also a masterpiece. He has been following the collection of historical facts since 1926. He has read a variety of history books and more than 100 kinds of Fang Zhida, written as 'Zhang Xianzhong', about 800,000 words before liberation. The upper volume, Chengdu Zhongliu Press printed the next volume. Although it is a fiction genre, the examination theme coincides with historical facts, and corrects the myths of Zhang Xianzhong and folk misinformation by some historians over 300 years. After liberation, Ren was standing at the height of today's history, reviewing and reinventing the book.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached] Yan Yuming: 'Anti-Party Offences of Renegades Relocation' (1957.8.30)\\nYi\\nIn their attack on the party, the party's renegation of the various popular movements led by the party was the first of all. He said: 'Three and Five Counters are not only chaos below, Beijing also chaos. Any unit can't play a tiger will take off the yarn hat. Counterferees have to get 5%, and this will have to elect generals from the lame.' He was all about to publicize the general purchase and sales, he fabricated rumors: 'Guangshandong died 400,000!' When rejecting the popular movements and the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Ren moved not only spoke at various meetings, but also engaged in anti-party instigation at any time and anywhere, and also used his reactionary comics to slander the party. This shows that he is doing all his best to fight political, class struggles against the party. Ren moved Qiao so deadly to attack the Party Central Committee and the mass movement led by the Party, precisely because these movements led by our Party have trained the masses and consolidated our country. Without the victories of these movements, it would be impossible to win the socialist revolution in a short period of time. Through their personal experience, the people throughout the country all say that these movements are good things, while Ren moved to say that these movements are bad things. Isn't it clear that his position is representing the interests of whom! We said it was very good! He said it was bad! We say that the achievements of these movements are basic, deviations and mistakes are only individual, and he says it is 'conscientious speech', 'mantra' and 'dogma.' Wang Xijian, a supporter of Ren Moved Qiao, also said: 'Talking to these people can only be the same as in the People's Congress. What achievements are certain, the disadvantages are individual' and so on. Why do they hate it the most? Because this sentence captures the mouth of their anti-socialist opposition. \\nRen moved and Qiao wanted to make us really go to 'conscientious talk', saying that all the movements led by our Party were wrong, they were all dark. He said, 'First of all our Party Central Committee, everything is right. With errors, this is not scientific.' He said he made the movement wrong. 'The central government also has a certain responsibility and should have self-criticism, but this is not seen.' Is there a spirit of 'self-criticism' in our central government? In Chairman Mao's writings and documents of the Party Central Committee, we can all see serious criticism and self-criticism. How many solemn criticism and self-criticism were in the report of Premier Zhou on the work of the Government at the First National People's Congress on June 26 this year. But what he wants is not this kind of self-criticism. What he wants is to deny all the victories and achievements made by our party leadership and people as a mess. We say that this is a big question of the destiny and interests of 60,000 people and cannot be sloppy. Ren and Qiao wants to deny our popular movements, that is, to deny socialism and negate the leadership of the Party. This is something we absolutely cannot allow. \\nèr\\nRen moved and Qiao denies that our party is a great, honorable and right party, and has neglected our party into a sectarian group that has devastated the people. Everyone knows that our party is a working-class political party wholeheartedly serving the people. The organization of the party exercises strict supervision over party members, requiring them to close contact with the masses, serve the people wholeheartedly, and put the interests of the Party, the state, and the masses above their personal interests. Party organizations have stricter demands on Party cadres, demanding that they have a higher sense of responsibility for the interests of the people, never dissociate themselves from the masses, are not complacent or afraid of difficulties, and firmly fight for the interests of the people. It is because of this, in the process of leading the people to a revolution and construction victory, our party members and Party cadres have gained more trust from the people. Ren moved and Qiao, as a party member, should have seen all this, but he wanted to hide the sky, maliciously neglected this basic situation and described our party as a sectarian group that is such a horrible and spooky. He said: 'People who are good to play will step up; the more they are hate by the masses, the leaders are holding them as sons', 'the more people who can attack the masses, the more they believe, they know how they should meet the horses,' 'these people are burnt incense to the leadership, and this is actually a sectarian formation with the leadership, influencing it. The prestige of the party undermines the interests of the party'. After Ren's move and Qiao has stigmatized our Party from top to bottom for some time, it is still not exhaustive, starting with Chairman Mao of the Party Central Committee, to the secretary of the provincial committee and the grassroots party member cadres all named names. He said that Chairman Mao also had personal worship. He said that the secretary of the provincial committee was the head of the parents, and said that grass-roots cadres were sticks of Ren moved thinking that in this way we can bring down the authority of our whole party, and he can 'replace it' with his right-wing partners. So he forgetfully said: 'In the past period of the Kuomintang, some journals openly cursed the KMT to kill the KMT, but we did not have them stable. 'People say that we have such a block, it is not objective'. You listen, how clear the conclusion of Ren's move and Qiao, he means: If your party is so 'bad', you should kill. If people say they want to kill your head, you do not agree, it is not objective! You see: How obvious is the conspiracy of Ren to move to Qiao-since it neglects the party into a 'sectarian group' against the people, what does this party do, of course, to kill, of course, can't accept his leadership, oppose the party leadership, and there is no socialism, but his delusions can never be realized, the people would push him down from the anti-party fortress and smash him down. \\nSan\\nThe move denies the democratic freedom of our party and country, while advocating the bourgeoisie's democratic freedom. Because our party is a truly wholehearted working-class party in the service of the people, our country is a people's democratic dictatorship that is dominated by the people. Within our party and in our country, there is basically a normal life of centralized, democratic, disciplined and free. However, Ren moved and Qiao denied this basic situation. He said: 'For a long time there was something that pressed me, that is, the democratic air inside and outside the party was not enough. Only allow to speak of consent, not to say objections, but only to say good, not bad.' He denies the party's democratic centralization system and describes our party as a feudal authoritarian group. Only allowed to catch up with horses and not to raise negative opinions. He slander comrades who firmly implement the Party's resolutions, comrades who obey the discipline of the Party, and who firmly maintain the unity of the party, is to shoot and burn incense. Instead, he said that his anti-party words and deeds were 'independent thinking' and described himself as a 'good man who has seen an unfair road and pull the sword to help each other.' Anyone who criticizes him for violating the principles of the party and opposing his anti-party words and deeds, he criticizes them as 'sticks' of the party and 'party committee revenge.' In particular, he disguised himself as a bold man for democratic freedom to incite others against the party, saying, 'You are too weak, because of this, others bully you, staring their eyes and they do, and boldly fight'. He calls himself 'daring to act', 'I can sacrifice everything in order to insist on the truth', 'Man does not commit me, I do not criminalize, and if a person offends me, I give him a double blow'. He also 'protested in his capacity as a citizen' to the provincial council. In this way, the resignation has become the 'hero' of his opposition group and some inexperienced young people who are 'most adhering to principles' and 'democratic freedom.' From this point of view, Ren's move is to discredit our party without democratic freedom and oppose the unity, concentration and discipline of our party as a sharp weapon for the anti-party. \\nRen qianqiao said that our country, no capitalist country has democratic freedom, and that there is no 'superclass democracy' in our country. According to his explanation, the 'super-class democracy' he calls for is that it can be 'openly' raised, regardless of whether or not, whatever the problem. This so-called 'super-class democracy' is precisely the 'democracy' that favours the bourgeois reactionaries to overthrow our people's democratic dictatorship. Ren qianqiao said that we do not have 'super-class democracy'. Is there a 'super-class democracy' in capitalist countries? Our democracy is the democracy of the majority of the people, and in capitalist countries there is only a bourgeois democracy. They are the politics of a small number of exploiters and the majority of working people, and we are the politics of the majority of the working people with a limited number of reactionary forces. There are democratic freedoms that exploit oppressive people in their countries, but the working people do not resist the democratic freedoms that they exploit oppression; the vast majority of working people in our country are masters of the country and have their own democracy and freedom, but the reactionary forces of the landlords bourgeois are not opposed to the people's democratic dictatorship and Socialist democracy and freedom, so it seems that the move is to deny our country's democratic freedom and promote capital Democratic freedom of the democratic nations, as a sharp weapon against socialism. \\nThe reason why he preached absolute democracy, absolute freedom, and indeed that absolute democracy and freedom did not exist, he wanted to speak out loudly about absolute freedom of democracy in an attempt to deceive our young people who had no experience in class struggles so that they would blindly oppose concentration., unity and discipline, causing chaos to facilitate the right towards the party and socialism Offense only. \\nSih\\nRen moved and Qiao denied the party's literary direction-the direction of workers and peasants. Now we need to pay special attention to defending the direction of our party's artisan and artisan workers, which is the right direction for the long period of socialist literary development and prosperity. The right-wing elements knew very well that the direction of workers and peasants could not be denied, and all their efforts to usurp leadership in the literary world were futile. In order to usurp the party's leadership in the arts, they would first come to deny the direction of workers and farmers, and therefore it was a war to attack and defend the direction of workers and peasants, a sharp class struggle on the literary front. Of course, their activities in the direction of attacking workers and peasants have not started today. Some people headed by Wang Xijian in our Shandong literary and artistic circles have been engaged in these activities vigorously over the years, but in the big magnification, they carried out an offensive on an unprecedented scale even more rampant. Their aim is to replace the direction of our workers and peasants with a bourgeois set of 'art for art' and 'art supremacy'. The alternative method is to advocate and emphasize 'artistic', discard thinking, on the one hand, to sacrifice 'vulgar sociology' and 'dogmatism', on the one hand, to the ideological and repeated siege toward the dumb discarded ideology. 'vulgar sociology' is a wonderful term. In the right, it seems that the right-wing elements have indeed become an all-mighty magic treasure. As long as the magic treasure is sacrificed, it seems like the principles of a mouth-sealing rune, political standards, and so on. The Party Committee also seems to have been beaten away by his magic treasure, and no longer dare to lead the literary work. So they can rejoice and inspire the mountains as king. As Wang Xijian said in his essay 'Hope': 'There may be places that are not polite enough, but this shows that everyone has become masters.' That's their wishful mind. Ren's move is just one of the core figures of these people, after Wang Xijian. Although Ren moved Qiao did not have many 'theories', even the meaning of 'vulgar sociology' was not clear, but his reactionary class consciousness made him understand the importance of 'vulgar sociology' as a weapon. He applied it anytime and anywhere, and opened fire at the party leadership and in the direction of workers and farmers. For example, the discussion about the 'Kiss Epaulette' comic. Ren moved to Qiao again and again, think this is a beautiful victory in the overall purpose of the provincial committee stinky. In fact, a comrade in charge of the provincial committee criticized that illustration was correct. Wang Xijian is not necessary to put on the provincial committee a hat of 'vulgar sociology'. It is necessary to 'fight a second victory again'. Of course, Wang Xijian has the highest interest, writing articles, provoking, and shattering guns and arrows, as if he was determined to continue this matter endlessly. Wang Xijian's move to Qiao, thinks that this is a unique opportunity for a lifetime, or is it not to let it go, and see their intentions, it is indeed to deal with the issue of the leadership of the provincial committee and the direction of workers and farmers. \\nRen said that in our country there is less 'creative freedom' than capitalist countries. What exactly do they have 'creative freedom'? They have freedom to sing the bourgeois, there is freedom to oppose socialism, and in our country there is broad freedom to create, we can let our great people go, sing to socialism, and freely expose the ugly enemies and freely criticize our own shortcomings, but The people do not allow anti-socialist freedom. The freedom that Ren Moved refers to is the freedom of the bourgeois anti-socialist opposition. Such a free people will never give them. On the issue of praise and exposure, Ren moved to reverse the principle of Chairman Mao's 'speech at the Yan'an Literary and Art Symposium', exposing the party and socialism as enemies. He painted three caricatures of anti-party anti-socialism fully illustrate his reactionary artistic ideas. Probably he thinks that his three anti-socialist caricatures are 'artistic'! He once said: 'Due to the curse, many works have reduced color a lot, so it is difficult to make our flowers bloom well'. Well, his three comics, which are not affected by the party's 'enchanting', probably will be greatly 'brightened'! But in addition to being used as reference materials in the opposition documents, there is the slightest artistry of this kind of downgrade thing? This is only poisonous grass, not flowers at all, let alone to bloom the flowers well. In order to find an argument for his own defiant party and socialist behavior, Ren Shih also trafficked the tone of 'writing the truth', saying what 'as long as there is something, you can paint boldly.' There is also a position on 'writing true'. What he calls 'writing true' is to write darkness, specialize in our shortcomings, exaggerate, distort them, and grind them into anti-party weapons that can be used to attack the party. Ren qianqiao also said: Literary and art should break all laws, just like running horses on a cliff, maybe get masterpieces, perhaps fall into the abyss. This is also the promotion of blind and absolute freedom in creativity, is the bourgeois mentalist literary and artistic thought, and it is also used to combat the direction of workers and farmers, and to corrode young people. The fact is that the move to promote 'cliff running horse' has indeed fallen into the abyss of the bourgeois. \\nFive\\nThe resignation of the opposition is very insidious. He used the so-called 'three old'-'old party members', 'old cadres', 'old painters' to create personal worship, to create so-called 'prestige', deceive young people who lack revolutionary experience, follow him blindly and defend him. He used the position given to him by the party-the provincial arts minister to carry out the activities of his small anti-party group. First of all, the APF Art Department was used as an anti-party base, and further liaisons in the art world, and usurped the leadership of the party, and treated the art community as his independent kingdom. When he approached others, he was always full of vulgar talk of the party's leadership cadres, pretending to have no shelf to confuse those young people who have liberal ideas. He pretends to be 'good guys', 'straight,' 'cheerful,' and 'daring to fight,' so that those who cannot observe people from a class point of view, and who cannot judge their right from political behavior. He pretended to be the face of a 'defender of the interests of the people' and a 'protector of young art workers', he went to attack the party and tried to provoke the power of unity of the dissociating party groups. He used his 'conscience', 'humanity', 'truth' and 'justice' to hide his betrayal party's words and deeds that betray the people. He used 'loving whistling', 'love to say strange words', 'fast mouth,' and 'uncluttered' to paralyse the political vigilance of ordinary cadres, and to pull up some people with anti-party sentiments. Therefore, the anti-socialist activities of the relocated opposition party have a 'protective color', and the venom he sprays easily erodes some unprepared people. This is like the 'painting skin' on the 'talk of Zaizhi', it will eat your heart. \\nFrom the political line of the party and the party's organizational line, from the Party Central Committee to the Party's grassroots level, the main focus is on the Party Central Committee and the provincial committee. Why don't he know that our Party Central Committee has the highest authority among the people. If they publicly slander the Party Central Committee, who will immediately suffer a serious blow from the people, but his hatred of the party towards the people towards socialism caused him to flush his mind and lose reason. He has a small group in the art world. His forces invaded the Department of Art of Shandong Normal University, the public daily, Shandong People's Publishing House, Ji'nan Comics Group and other corners, and through his small group called several artists in Ji'nan City The author's meeting organized an attack on the provincial committee. He himself also personally went to Qingdao Wenlian to set fire and held meetings privately. Conveying the so-called 'central spirit' without allowing the staff of the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to participate. We say that Ren's move, through his small opposition group, has opened up his independent kingdom in the art world. He has already dominated the art world and sees the art community as his opposition position and counterparty tool. \\nWhile relocating the face of a 'free' painter, he has a lot of political ambition. He overestimated their anti-party, anti-people and anti-socialist forces, believing that once the time comes, he can first seize the leadership of the literary and artistic circles in order to accompany the national right-wing offensive against the Party against socialism. He used all his power to attack the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Committee. He said, 'I want to make a big deal, like cadres at the director level, I do not want to do it.' When his anti-party words and deeds began to be criticized by the majority of cadres, he also said: 'The provincial committee wants me, let them do it! Anyway, the more they engage me, the more they get away from the masses. He believes that he has so much strong support for his 'masses', so he believes that it is not a problem to seize all the leadership of the arts and the arts. Therefore, we cannot view the resignation as a general, dissatisfied with the party, with anti-party sentiment, but as a traitor who collaborates with the right outside the party in a political struggle against the party. We must go through this inevitable, sharp class struggle with him until he is completely exposed to the anti-party crimes of his small opposition group, disarming him both ideologically and politically, without winning. \\nOur struggle against the right in the literary world is slow, first of all because the UPF group has sympathy and right-wing ideas; secondly, some people resist and obstruct it from it, such as Wang Xijian once said: 'If the provincial party committee plays the right to the Provincial Union, we can create 20 in a week.' Such a claim is extremely absurd, and it is an extremely bad stigma and resistance to the struggle against the right. Can the right-wing elements have drilled our party's holy squeeze and carry out a desperate and vicious attack on the party. Who can make it? Those who attack the party as viciously as Wang Xijian must be honest. Our right-wing elements in Shandong literary circles have moved more than one person, and our struggle is arduous. We must thoroughly check through the struggle, overcome the warmth and right-leaning ideology, reorganize our literary and artistic team, firmly carry out the struggle to defend the Party, defend socialism and defend the Party's literary direction. \\n[August 30, 1957, 'Popular Daily', selected from the Shandong Literary and Art World of Anti-Right Struggle, Shandong People's Publishing House, Jinan, 1959]\\n"},

He slandered our party, 'personal worship formed a system. As soon as the superiors speak, it is said here,' he blatantly defamed the leaders of the Party and the country. He said: 'There is a personal worship in the Soviet Union, China does not have. This is not scientific.' Ren moved and Qiao made serious mistakes in slander of the Party and the Party Central Committee but did not make self-criticism. He said: 'Three and Reversals, this is not only chaos below, Beijing is also messy. Any unit can't play a tiger will pick up the yarn hat. Counterferees have to get 5% of the figure, which will have to elect generals from the lame. These are all related to central policy,' he said, 'The People's Daily simply says that the reason why pork is in short supply is due to the improvement of people's lives is deceiving.' Ren moved and Qiao cursed our party as much as the KMT. He was extremely opposed to the fight against the right, saying, 'In the past, there were some journals openly cursing the KMT to kill and the like. But we are not stable with them.' Ren moved Qiao's cadre policy of stigmatizing the Party said: 'People who are good booting will step up, the more they hate the masses', and the leaders are holding them as a son... Ren and Qiao also seize the shortcomings in the criticism of individual comrades in charge of comics, and incite the provinces to stink everywhere. At this time, Ren Relocation published three comics in the office blackboard newspaper in a row that libelled the party. \\nMost of the comrades of the Federation gradually recognized the face of the relocated right-wing elements, they fought against him. Ren moved to resist not, cunning could not be completed, he made a preliminary statement at the meeting of all the staff of the Federation. However, the resignation shifted away from his serious reactionary remarks and defiance against the party's leaders. People are very dissatisfied with the resignation of the move, and continue to expose and repudiate his anti-party words and deeds. Comrade Wang Anyou cited the fact that the provincial cultural union supposedly refuted the fallacy of the resignation of the intention to stigmatize the anti-movement. Wang Anyou said that Ren qianqiao's comic comic comic comrade Long Qiyun played square and even promoted three levels in the 'anti-counter'. This is purely a defamation of nothing. Long Qiyun was promoted in the past. Comrade Yu Sheng refuted the resignation that 'there is a lot of rules and regulations in the literary and artistic circles', saying: it is not that you are not allowed to show what, but in what position you stand on to manifest. If you stand on the landlord class standpoint to show that the land reform is 'very bad', the majority of the peasant masses of course will not let you! Miao Deyu and other comrades expose Ren qianqiao under the sign of the 'old revolution', claiming to be 'straight character', 'a little human touch', and selling his private goods. He also pointed out that his attacks on the party had been a long plan and should be accounted for. (1957.8.11)\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 7"}

The thrilling and protracted political movement that took place in the Chinese land in 1957 was a very significant political event in China and even in the world. It was also an extremely significant historical event, and it must be for this extremely despicable campaign of 'predators' will be judged unrelentlessly and impartially by history. History will only pronounce itself on the heinous crimes against human cultural civilization, human rights and democracy and freedom committed by the sponsors of the campaign. History will also prove that even though they are rampant for a moment, the promoters of the anti-right movement and the executors, they can unscrupulously exploit the power and violence held in their hands to cause great tragedy in the human world, leaving tens of millions of innocent wives separated and killed their families and relatives. The mob wilderness brings endless calamity and suffering to them and their families. Fortunately, history is not shifted by the will of the rulers, and the survivors of the gripper tragedy have been convinced of this for decades. Although the perpetrators and executors of the anti-right movement were untold, the survivors of the gulf tragedy told the author through their own words and actions that neither sufferings nor death would amount to failure; on the contrary, the fact of iron would eventually blow the persecting intellectuals. of the autocrats nailed to the historical stigma column. \\nI. Environment in which the gutter tragedy took place and the source of the anti-right movement\\nThe People's Republic of China was established in Jiuquan, Gansu, where the tragedy occurred, was a farm for the third army army of the PLA. Because of poor land, salt and alkali were too large, the food was not enough to seed. In 1952, it was built here. The reservoir hub consists of dams and water transport buildings, the dam is homogeneous sand-loam dams. After many years of operation, the dam has serious engineering problems, the dam slope seepage is unstable and discarded. In July 1954, the farmland was converted into a state-owned new labour farm, which had been held in land reform, anti-township, anti-counter-counter-and anti-Hu movement landlords, counter-revolutionaries and some criminal elements. In July 1956, it was converted to a working farm for the placement of re-education workers who had completed their sentences. The anti-right, anti-revolutionary, bad and anti-socialist anti-socialist elements of the anti-right movement who had been imprisoned in late 1957 were converted to re-education through labour farms in order to incarcerate and rehabilitate the anti-right movement. Its site was built on the original site of the Longwang Temple, about two miles away from the village. About 30 kilometers northeast of Jiuquan City, south of the mountain, north of the north of the city. Its southeast side is called Linshui, North Bay is called North Bay, and the northwest is called new tiandun The sandy mountain with a beacon is called Maojiashan. There are more than 10,000 acres of land on the total farm, and the new tianduan work station has more than 4,000 acres, most of these land are saline and alkali land with very large and not long crops. The land at the new Tim Dun Station was cultivated only in 1956. The land is barren, mostly in the Gobi desert, irrigated by the Peking River. \\nIn 1957, the anti-right movement left a portion of the cadre of prisoners who had been released from labour, mostly moved to Mamanmanshan labour farms. In early November 1957, four members of the Jiuquan Transportation Company in Gansu Province, four members of the Labour Bureau, and 48 members from the Zhangye District Office on November 16 were the first batch of re-education workers on the Jangbiangou Farm. Since then, they began to escort ideological and political prisoners here. According to Gansu Provincial Committee Ganfa (64), 60 confidential documents statistics, a total of 2,369 people sent to the sandwich ditch farm, there are 887 right-wing elements, accounting for about 37.44%; anti-revolutionaries 898, accounting for 37.9%, (these counter-revolutionaries, are not enough standards in the anti-movement and in 1957 in the magnification there right-wing speech and general historical problems); bad elements 438, about 18.49% (bad elements are more complex. Workers and military fighters who have speech problems in the anti-right movement are classified as bad elements; the PLA fighter in Shaanxi Hu County, who does not fight the rebels while fighting bandits in Gannan, Wang Zhiqin, etc., have also been sent to the gutter by the bad elements of the anti-party anti-socialist); Anti-socialists 68, or about 2.87% (mainly in the Great Leap Forward), (False reporting of exaggerated party and political cadres); 78 corrupt and illegal elements, accounting for about 3.29%. However, according to La Jinghua, a survivor of the sandwich farm, she was pumped to a temporary office set up at the end of 1960 by the central working group to set up at the Gaodai Farm, and the total number of people sent to the Ditch Farm was more than 3,000, and the number survived at that time was more than 500. \\nAt the peak of 1958, the number of prisoners reported to the Gansu Provincial Bureau of Labour Reform was 3,074. In November 1958, the Department sent clothes to the re-education workers, according to his diary of 3,136 persons, and the list was stamped out. But in November 1958, the gutter had committed suicide, died and died of many people, and had since been sent to the right-wing, counter-revolutionaries and bad elements in various units, to unobedient right-wing elements from other farms, college students and right-leaning opportunists who had pulled white flags. In addition, some of those who are not obedient with their leaders are tied up without files, and there are also units that have not yet been qualitative, all have not been counted into this figure. Therefore, the number of prisoners provided by the above is more than 3,500, with only more than 500 survivors, not more than 600. So, the number of people in the file of the Gansu Provincial Committee is that the former farm leaders and the former Gansu Provincial Committee squeezed the number of false reports in order to exonerate their guilt. They underreported the number of people sent into the gutter and expand the number of survivors. The death toll was only counted at the Farm Department and the new Tim Tuan Station, and the Mingshui Beach death toll was not counted into the death toll on the sandwich groove farm, creating a proportion of live back close to 50%. \\nWang Zhi, a survivor of the Lanzhou Military Region Combat Cultural Corps, who was beaten as right-wing elements, told the author that when the leadership sent him to the sandwich farm in May 1961 to retrieve the files of more than a dozen re-education workers in the Lanzhou Military Region, he saw that some people were specially left in the field to make up the cause of death, and the cause of death was filled in the field. What is lung cancer, cirrhosis, cardiopulmonary disease, renal failure, myocardial infarction, suicide And so on, almost all the names of diseases in the Chinese medical code have been used. Yang Daoben, a survivor of the sandwich groove, told the author that there are La Jinghua, Yang Daoben and two doctors Gong Lin and Changshijie who have fabricated the files of death on the farm. There were many things to do fake in that era. After saving lives, in order to cope with the families of the deceased re-education workers, the farmer graves who had been dying up the funnel death, casually wrote a name on the stone to fool their families with paint to fool their families. On the eve of the dissolution of the farm in November 1961, the author made up General Fu Zuoyi brothers forestry expert Fu Zuogong files, Fu Zuogong's death report writes this:\\nFu Zuogong, male, 38 years old, in Shanxi Province, died of illness in May 1960. When he went to the scene in 1958, he had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis, deanal, usually often diarrhea, had been treated with gastric astringent, rest and rotation care. Since the winter of 1959, the body has been gradually wasting, once fainted, first aid awake to rest and treatment, the condition has improved. \\nSevere diarrhea occurred in May 1960, that is, admitted to hospital care, patients with cough, asthma, weak physique, weak heart, bradycardia, nutrition, cardiac, gastric astringent and antiseptic drugs, combined treatment with Chinese and Western medicine, the condition slightly improved after the team rest and recuperation treatment. In 1960, there was little participation in labour. Patients often take nutrients internally, but the physique is gradually wasting and weakening. On November 11, 1959, the patient went out privately, coma, after discovery, vigorously rescued, but eventually due to serious illness, sharp deterioration, rescue ineffective and stopped breathing. \\nDiagnosis of death: acute heart failure (after burial of the mountain)\\nAttending Physician: Chan Chiu Tong\\nProcuratorate: Jiuquan People's Procuratorate\\nNovember 8, 1961 (Stamped: Communist Party of China's local State-owned Jiuquan Biangou Farm Branch Committee)\\n(This is a report on the death of a sandwich farm in Fu Zuogong's file more than a year after the death of Fu Zuogong. Such a report has since been fabricated a lot, first to deal with family tracing families, and the second is to file to justify the death and the merit of the farm. But from this report it says that the rescue was ineffective on 11 November 1959, and how severe diarrhoea could occur again in May 1960, you can know the haste, quality and shamelessness of these people in their fabrication. In addition, in the investigation, the author found that, in order to exonerate the guilt, the farmhouse, decriminalized the number of re-education personnel sent above and reduced the number of persons sent to them; they expanded the number of people who had no unit claim, homeless, and fabricated many people were sent to Anxi Ten Workers, Anxi Fourth Gong, Jiuquan suburb, Xihe Qing, Gaotai, New China, Wudaping, North Bay and other farms, thereby expanding the number of survivors and reducing the number of actual deaths in re-education through labour. Moreover, the re-education personnel sent to Mingshui Dahe Farm in Gaotai County intentionally dissociated from the jiangbiangou farm, so that nearly 2,000 people who died in Mingshui Beach were not counted. This is why the survivors, former correctional cadres and the earliest statistician La Jinghua said the total number and the number of deaths announced by the Gansu Provincial Committee Words have a reason for that big gap. \\nSun Jinling, director of the Chengguan Branch Bureau of Lanzhou City Public Security Bureau, told the author that when he was Deputy Chief of the Political Security Unit of Jiuquan City Public Security Bureau in 1978, the meeting notes said that the labor re-education personnel who were in the middle of the age of 20s to 30s were generally between the ages of 20s and 30s, mainly the far-right in organs, enterprises and schools in Gansu Province The historical counter-revolution of the elements, right-wing elements, and the magnified in the magnification Molecules, and bad elements with right-wing rhetoric. But there are also many from other parts of the country, for example, Zhu Jiaju, sent from Nanjing to Anhui to re-education through labor to Gansu. Judging from the above statistics, the anti-right movement led to the gutter tragedy. The indirect reason is that the anti-right movement has evolved into a great leap forward and then the whole country's hungry famine. The direct reason is that the logic of the right is the reactionary that makes the pensionary labourers of labour, beating, punishing food and cold. Hungry one dead in the desert Gobi. \\nSecond, the sandwich tragedies let the anti-right movement human ugly play to the extreme\\nLike the previous movements of the People's Republic of China since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the most important feature of the anti-right movement is the incitement of so-called 'class hatred', which allows people to inform each other, expose each other, criticize each other, and criticize each other. So, many of the right-wing groups were made up of the right, bad, or counter-revolutionaries by their sons, wives expose their husbands, sons, husbands expose their wives, and friends with each other. There are only more than 30 people, and more than 3,000 re-education through labour labour officers are mainly managed by correctional personnel themselves. The team captain and team leader here are all held by inmates in re-education through labour. The management method implemented is to inform each other, expose each other, bind each other, and beat each other. Luo Shuqun, a former survivor of the propaganda department of the Wuwei Land Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC), in Gansu Province, said to the author, 'At that time, in order to give a good impression to the management cadres, in addition to their positive performance and hard work, there were some people who deliberately made proposals and made small reports to the correctional cadres. The farm also takes advantage of this to allow prisoners to rectify prisoners, let prisoners take care of prisoners, and, moreover, prisoners criticize speaking together more than correctional discipline.' Since there are prisoners informing each other and exposing each other, it is said that correctional cadres have a lot more and many eyes and ears. They can always know the thinking dynamics and behavior of every person on the farm, and can know what is happening in every corner of the farm, big and small. In addition, correctional officers hold the power of prisoners to life and death. They can simply detain the food of people struggling on the death line, and they can take meals for a reward, so that they can call prisoners at any time to bind the beating prisoners. \\nFormer engineering technician of the Engineering Department of Zhangye District of Gansu Province, Gao Xuewu, a survivor, said to the author: 'Those senior intellectuals who usually have a good quality and never say dirty words will be subjected to arbitrary verbal abuse by correctional cadres here. What 'Dog Day', 'Donkey Day', 'Mom That Cunt ', 'Old Zi Killed You', 'You Eat Livestock ', 'You still want to transform well, transform your mom's cunt', 'Do you want to go back to work, can you work again? It is daydreams', 'a lifetime is not well made', 'This world wants you stupid, lazy, but also come up with the edge groove back to the unit, blind thinking! Just here for a lifetime, 'tie your dog day', 'kill your dog day', 'starve your dog day', 'you think you are capable of being able to endure, that is, Sun Wukong is alive, can't escape the sandwich ditch like the hand of the Buddha, read a tight spell is enough for you to suffer a few days' and so on. In addition to being subjected to verbal abuse, correctional officers are often tied up and hung by correctional cadres. They beat people up, they are tougher than landlords, bullies, hooligans and bandits. Everyone dares to be angry and afraid to speak and numb. When bundled, the prisoners should also follow the roar, followed by scolding, some people followed shouting, while wiping tears and shouting. Some people close their eyes, open their mouths, raise their hands to cover their faces, dressed together to shout slogans. Others do not listen to the crying and shouting of the heart-torn.' \\nThe former underground party member of Jingyuan County of Gansu Province, Wang Zhong, Survivor Huang Zhong, said to the author: 'No matter how gripped in our hearts, how late and torment the soul endured, in the sandwich ditch can only withstand it all silently, it is really a strong shit stick only to swallow in the stomach. We are formed as 'cattle ghosts', but we believe that we are not 'cattle ghosts', we are indeed people, are people with flesh and blood from their parents, ah, we should also have the minimum right to be human beings, but we still have to 'transform' ourselves in hard labor, hoping to change ourselves into a new The self. Captain Hu Jiaying and Tang (all re-education personnel), abused me the most badly when he was on the farm. As Hu Jiaying scolded: 'When you see you this man is not angry, with a gun, I will shoot you to death. Whoever gives you food is a crime in itself, so that you may not eat enough, and not starve to die. Team Tang scolded: 'You bad guy, where you want to eat. ' Because I asked for a full meal, Tang team leader was dissatisfied, picking a large basket filled with Tim high to lift me, and tied me twice because I was unable to lift it. The leader is so to me, it becomes normal to beat me inside the group to scold me. During the summer harvest of the four infrastructure teams, because team leader Chai Hogan (re-education personnel), beat me casually, inside the group there were Zhang Banyun, King Naizhong, Xiao Dewu, Xue Hui, Liang Tingmin (all re-education personnel), and others. In particular, Xue Hui and I lift the basket, because I walked slowly, was fined to overtime work, dissatisfied in my heart, borrowed me to rest and put the basket without saying hello to others, he took me a bar from the leg, at that time I fainted the past, and did not move the road for two or three days. After joining the production team of four groups in early February, the study team leader Wei Jianzhong (re-education personnel), tied me, the team members beat me: Zhang Jianliang, Ma Yangquan, Jia Tianzuo, Wang Minwu (all re-education personnel), and others. As for just cursing me 'day your mother', 'reactionary', 'black heart', 'no conscience' and other words are more common. One time at a group meeting, criticized me to reflect the problem of inadequate food. Zhang Jianliang said to me, 'You say that you are not enough to eat, the more you ask you to give you ten pounds of food for a month after you cannot eat, do not believe you can't get this raw cow leather down. ' 'Feed the dog doesn't call you to eat.' \\nFormer Minister of Propaganda Department of the Party Committee of the Northwest Third Engineering Bureau of China's State Department of State Construction and Engineering Department Ji Cai told the author about such a thing, 'At that time the correctional cadres in the field also often beat correctional personnel, and director Liu Zhenyu and captain Yan just cursed us as 'donkey ball day'. The workers who stayed in the labour force and some of the re-education workers who worked for the tiger also beat their own classes. In addition, the farm squad captain of the brigade groove farm squad is very large, and often beats inmates at will. In addition, the farm allows labour reform to release prisoners to the right to care for re-education workers. These people are very powerful for beating and punching right wing officers. However, correctional cadres do not dare to stop them, and they are afraid to be tied to right-wing opportunistic hats. At that time, some correctional cadres in the field were casually finding stubble for tied exercises and competitions, and many prisoners were tied up and maimed. I remember that there was a young officer Zhang, a tianjin man. He and Captain Yan were tied up at the incongruent prisoner to see who tied Delisso. The captain Yan tied up Wang of the original Dingxi Food Management Institute; Director Wang, who was the army's transition cadre, was sent here after he was beaten to the right. When the sand reclamation was slower, he was tied off his arm by captain Yan. This officer Zhang tied a re-education officer alive to death. \\nThere was a re-education worker named Wang Ren qunniujie. This is a Shanghai-based man who came to Lanzhou to support the Northwest China, and was then designated as far-right elements sent to the Sandwich Farm. Because he was seized of rice and was unable to work, he could not work. One day out looking for wild vegetables on the way through the vegetable garden, pulled a radish, the soil was stuffed in the mouth without wiping it, and it was still in the future had time to bite, let the labor reform in the garden here release the prisoner Lufubao caught punching and kicking, and pulled him to the field. Officer Zhang tied Wang Ren qunniujie without asking to pick up a rope. I was in front of me. He wound the thin hemp rope around Wang Ren qunniujie's two arms, and then slipped on, and only listened to Wang Ren qunniujie's brutal call, 'Ah-. ' Correctional cadre Zhao Laigou said, 'You are bundled too badly, slow and slower. ' There was no sound since then. People called Dr. Duan Zhaoxi. After coming, Dr. Duan said, hurry up, hurry up and lift it to the hospital. In the end, however, the man was not saved, and such a rope tied man to death. The prisoner Wang Ren qunniujie was punished to death in front of his wife who visited his family. Wang Ren qunniujie's wife saw his husband being tortured into this way, and his legs fell softly to the ground and fainted. Wang Ren qunniujie's wife hanged at the door of the dish cellar that night. Hey, one radish, two lives!' \\nThe anti-right movement portrayed the right as a heinous reactionary. Therefore, in addition to the correctional cadres, in addition to beating prisoners at random, they also let prisoners beat prisoners and inmates monitor prisoners. The most hateful thing is that they treat former reformers as cronies, who have an inexplicable hatred of intellectuals Hate, torture the right, the counter-revolution to use the means of heinous, so that humanity is ugly Here play to the extreme. \\nThird, the sandwich groove tragedy is a natural disaster or a human accident murder under the extreme left line of anti-right movement\\nThe prison labor workers are broadly divided into right-wing, anti-revolutionary, bad, anti-socialist, embezzlement and law-breaking elements. Most are right-wing, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements from the anti-right movement, followed by the fact that the far left in order to clear the stumbling blocks before and during the Great Leap Forward are so-called anti-socialists of party and political cadres. \\nFor example, Yang Wanyi, a survivor who was formerly the head of the Zhangye District Planning Commission, told the author, 'The Planning Commission, because it disagreed that Anzhen, secretary of the regional committee of Zhangye, Gansu Province, bragged about 20% increase in grain production in Zhangye, Gansu Province, before the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in Zhangye, Gansu Province, to reach 2.3 billion pounds. said that the planning commission surveyed the regions reported total grain production of only 1.9 billion. Jin, that is, 1.9 billion pounds of grain reported in various regions also have a lot of water, and some counties in Zhangye area had food problems in 1958, and farmers have started starving. Disagree that food production has increased so much, saying that the key issue at this time is disaster relief. So, said the planning committee and the party were not in line. The backbone of the Planning Commission then became anti-party elements. Wang Guosen, Yang Wanyi, Xie Qiyun, Ma Qianli and Zhang Jin are all anti-party elements of the opposition group. Wang Guosen, deputy director of the planning commission, was expelled from party nationality, dismissed from public office, sent to a farm to re-education through labor. Yang Wanyi was expelled from the Party, retained public office, sent to a farm in the sandwich groove for re-education through labour. Xie Qiyun was expelled from the Party, expelled from public office, sent to the sandwich groove farm re-education through labour. Ma Qianli was sent to Anxi Ten Gong Farm for re-education through labor. \\nAnd that is, the 400 million kilograms of food overstated in Zhangye area caused the food of household households in Zhangye area to be searched out. Zhang Chinese-style, who wrote 'Zhangye City Zhi', told the author, 'Zhangye area actually died 130,000 people in Minqin County; Zhangye County hungry died 78,000 people, and the whole family died 98 families, 58 people who eat people.; Gaotai County starved more than 50,000 people; 14 agricultural counties in Hexi More than 400,000 people. In October 1959, when the canal was repaired, more than 3,000 people died in a heavy snow. \\nNow many people ask the author that there were so many re-education through labor farms across the country that year. In Jiuquan area of Gansu alone, there were 11 re-education through labor farms held in the anti-right movement, bad and right. Why almost all of the correctional labor elements in the jiangbiangou farm in Gansu died? Survivors of the year told the author that first, the farmland of the sandwich groove farm was barren, and at most could only feed 3,400 people, but more than 3,000 people were detained, and during the Great Leap Progression period, the farm leaders bragged not a single grain of the country, to be self-sufficient, and the food obtained by the sandwich farm was far from able to feed these re-education prisoners. The second is heavy labor, the gutter farm allows inmates to work in general more than 12 hours, and often play the ring to compete, and the weak prisoners are mostly alive and tired and others will be bodied. Third, the policy propaganda above that year 'the right is the reactionary,' and the following farm leaders and corrections believe that these people are sent to the cleavage farm as another way to eliminate the reactionaries. Therefore, many other re-education through labor farms, so-called 'reformations' and 'badly rehabilitated' inmates in re-education through labor have all been transferred to the sandwich gutter farm and lost their lives. On the cause of death of inmates through labour, Wang Bingxiang, former secretary of the Gansu Provincial Committee, said in his 'Report to the Provincial Committee on the issue of sandwich gutter farms', 'Zhang Ye, first secretary of the land committee, Anzhen, accused the comrades who reflect the low rations of prisoners and re-education personnel and the death problem of being 'shouting for prisoners'. This contributes to the misconceptions and practices of disregard for human life, 'There are also dead people in the countryside, what is amazing for a few dead inmates', 'One dead, one less counter-revolution'. As a result, while the food rations for re-education workers have been reduced repeatedly, the production task has been added. Since Anzhen, the first secretary of the Zhangye Land Commission, was this attitude. Therefore, Liu Zhenyu, the former director of the Sandwich Farm, said at the assembly of the Sandwich Farm, Lenin said that in order to achieve the goal of the revolution, you can use no means and shoot people still have to waste a bullet. Zhou Xiaoli, a right-wing survivor of Tianshui, Gansu, listened to this saying that hair in his heart and risked his life to escape from the groove. Because the right was the so-called 'reactionary' at that time, in order to eliminate these 'reactionaries', the farm used all the means used by these prisoners in labor, the horrific tragedy took place. At that time, the Party School of the Gansu Provincial Committee sent 11 excellent teachers and cadres in the sandwich gutter farm, only came out alive as a survivor of Cheng Rain. \\nThe leaders of the Gansu Provincial Committee and Zhangye Land Committee were very clear about the situation of a large number of dead people at the time. So on July 31, 1959, vice-chancellor of Lanzhou University, Huang Xiqun, secretary of the Kuomintang delegation for the North peace talks, and Xie Zaishan among these prestigious senior intellectuals, in 1959, were already aware that people on the farm would be tortured by hunger and forced labor at all times in 1959. Gu senior intellectuals moved from the jiuquan new machinery factory in Gansu province from the jiuquan farm, this It's a labor factory that has a quantitative supply, so these people who have been specially protected can survive. \\nThe main reason for almost all the death of correctional labor workers on the farm is that in 1960 the majority of the bodies of inmates in re-education through labour had collapsed, but in September 1960, Zhangye and the Ditch Farm pulled more than 2,000 inmates who were at risk of death at Gaotai County to Mingshui Beach in September 1960. At this time, the Hexi Corridor of Gansu has been mixed with snow and snow. Prisoners live in caves, drink some dense soup every day, cold and hunger quickly take their lives. It is not that Qian Ying and the central working group saved lives, perhaps even these survivors are not in the world. Wang Junfeng, a teacher survivor of the Gansu Provincial Institute of Finance and Economics, has been burying dead people's work plan. He said to the author, 'When the gutter just died, he was a wooden coffin, but also put a card in front of the grave. Later, more people died, they used two large baskets of astraws into the corpse buried. After every day there were dead people, they were wrapped with the quilt of the dead, a rope tied to the lower limbs, a rope tied to the shoulder, and then used a flat burden for two people before and after carrying them on a sand slope or buried on the Gobi slope of Mingshui mass graveyard. At that time, people died of starvation, no one dared to say that it was starving, the health office had compiled medical records, and the field was still shouting slogans every day, encouraging people to declare war on difficulties, and, when the number of dead people, the louder this slogan. At the beginning, fewer people die on the farm, not buried at night during the day, after the death of more people regardless of day and night. People are like wood, look dull, a head walk, puffy eyes become a fine slit. We buried the dead man, just on a stone or on a wooden sign, his name and buried it next to the heap of the dead. \\nWhen it came to Mingshui, people fell from physical and mental strength. There are several main reasons for this: one is the complete breakdown of people spiritually. Prisoners thought that only three out of more than 3,000 re-education workers had taken their caps and that thre"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "e had to leave for work, which was undoubtedly sentenced to life imprisonment. In addition, a right-wing, desperate in despair, stole a gold shell pocket watch from Nanyang Tsai, and deliberately defeated it, and was sentenced by a court to one year's imprisonment for theft and transferred to the labour force to serve his sentence. In 1960, the right-wing was released and came to Mingshui to take what he put in the field, causing a lot of wind. The rightists said, when the right is better than sentencing to reform labor, you see, people have been released free of their sentences. So, at this time, people feel that re-education through labour is distant and completely desperate. The second is that people were overworked between 1958 and 1959, and most prisoners were already tired. Both right-wing and historical counter-revolutions are mostly senior intellectuals, and readers are weaker than the average. Third, the rations fell to 14 pounds of raw food per month, plus people live in the ditch to dig out the cave, most live one or two people, some can live four or five people, there is no little heating facilities. There are also artificial soils in the nest and caves where correctional cadres live. Because of the cold weather, the Hexi Corridor had temperatures at minus 20 degrees at that time, shaving the wind of a knife all day, cutting the face. So, after October, a large number of dead people began. In addition, hungry people see what to eat, eat grasshoppers, eat lizards, pick up dead rats and tear raw meat with their hands, they also eat dead people's internal organs and eat the stool of correctional cadres. 'This candid eating is the main cause of large numbers of dead people.' \\nWang Junfeng said that he stopped here, and then continued to say, 'There was a Yongjing man named Hu Zhizhong, and buried the dead together with me. One day he changed two fur coat worth 1890 yuan for two pounds of fried noodles. The 1890 yuan at that time was not a small number. I said, Are you crazy? He laughed and said, 'I eat it in my mouth first and don't know who it is tomorrow? Can I still get into my mouth? At that time, prisoners steal the internal organs of the dead. Anyone knows that every time the dead person buried, they can see that the body being dug was cut out by a knife, some people hiding behind the sand pile and burned with hay and eat, there were quietly dried and eaten slowly. Only some people were too obvious that they were found by correctional cadres to be criticized and tied up at the general meeting. On one occasion, a prisoner pulled out the person's heart and lung liver into the cave, ready to eat, and had not reached his mouth, he was discovered by a correctional cadre. The punishment called me, and let me take that man back the offal back to the original place. On the road I asked him, how do you think of eating this, he said, the Japanese had eaten the Chinese during the War of Resistance against Japan. He went to the place where he pulled the dead offal, but too many dead people, a sand pile connected with a sand heap, he could not identify which he dig the dead sand pile, so, we just planed a pit, threw the internal organs inside, buried with sand. \\nThe day before the winter solstice in 1960, this day was the day we buried the most dead. In the morning I and Hu Zhi carried out 28 people, gathered together in the afternoon were 36 people, and pulled out with a carriage. The corpses were cold and could not excavate the pit, but were sprinkled with sand on the corpses, even if they were buried. We died 64 people on one station this day. At that time there were three stations in Mingshui, East, West and Middle. Who knows how many people died that day. \\nMingshui Beach dead people's situation is like a man with a broom sweep leaves in autumn, the front west has not been swept off, behind a leaf to be swept, behind the east swept, front fell a large piece. Almost 60 years have passed since the gripping gutter tragedy. Sixty years of wind and rain have led us to reflect on that bloody, horrible, brutal, stormy anti-right movement. Hu Dehai, a professor of right-wing Northwest Normal University and PhD instructor of Pedagogical Principles of Northwest Normal University, said to the author: 'The anti-right movement has distorted the hearts and morals of many Chinese people. People have since been forged to lose their independent thinking, independent opinions and independent personality. The billions of children have learned from this unprecedented campaign of blood and tears of 'evil from the mouth', and have since moved away from being wrong, deceiting morality, or insincerity, or deaf or dumb, or singing to merit, and many became slaves and slaves who fell in front of the powerful. The anti-right movement has destroyed the social culture and mechanisms inherent in the Chinese nation and Chinese society, and buried the traditional virtues of kindness, benevolence, fraternity, integrity, faithful and piety. Since then, militant violence has prevailed. Unscrupulous shame, look at the wind rudder, take tolerance, slaves and knees, wagging and other evil acts, not ashamed, anti-proud, for a moment turned out to be the style of the times. This movement has ushered in a new era in which contemporary China trampled on democracy, freedom, constitutional law and human rights, with authoritarian dictatorships unabated. The campaign has also led to a sharp change in the Chinese Communist Party's official style and a change in the spirit of officials. For they have learned from their personal experience that leadership is the master of people's destiny, that no leadership at any level can be blasphemed, and must be praised, because they are the leaders, owners and masters of this society. Worship power, suppress culture, knowledge, has become the norm. As for those who have knowledge, in front of those in power, they can only be a tool to speak, can beat at any time, arbitrarily bully, do whatever they want, have become commonplace, and can not be taken. This unscrupulous situation and social atmosphere created by the anti-right movement was a political haze that the Chinese people could breathe at all times. The authoritarian nature, barbarity, ignorance and its anti-humanity, anti-human cultural and civilizational qualities, which were unprecedented in China's history, were invariably at any time. Everywhere can be touched, making every slightly rational, slightly conscious and upright person living in it feel depressed and Pain, sometimes feel too breath, feel the bitter sea boundless, difficult to get rid of, no sigh. And the inherent spirit of the Chinese nation, the positive spirit that the Chinese people espouse, is also in the process of being slaughtered, curbed and destroyed. The quality of the Chinese nation has since been sinking down, falling thousands of times, and was lost.' \\nThe anti-right movement disrupted the backbone of Chinese intellectuals, destroyed all the elites cultivated in China since modern times, destroyed China's moral culture for thousands of years, causing the new cultural movement of modern times to die prematurely without completing its historic mission. The anti-right movement is the overall cause of the Great Leap Forward, Holofamine and Cultural Revolution in China. Its reactivism has become more and more clear with the development of history. At the same time as 60 years of the anti-right movement, we further explore from the testimony of the survivors in the Anti-Right Movement's Sandwich Ditch Survivors 'Testimony. Let people trace their roots, reflect deeply, recognize the facts, and learn from history. \\n(Zhao Xu: writer, associate professor of a university in Lanzhou City, the earliest researcher in the history of the right three generations\\n(Transfer from: Hyperlink 'http://www.citizencn.com/news/?p=40896''), http://www.citizencn.com/news/?p=40896"}

The next big newspaper is part of its reactionary remarks. \\nFirst of all, accept the opinions of Comrade Bai Xiaoping and Mu Wenshi, and strive to proceed from the desire of unity and the wind and rain, and argue. \\nI cite the example of 'easy teeth' in my address to the General Assembly is in the speech at Du Jiaji that he was discharged because of his opinion (?), Team leader post after this issue. \\nThe central purpose of the speech is to remind leaders not to be good, not to listen to the same opinions, not to listen to different opinions, and to simply think that people with different opinions do not come close to the party, and to discourage discrimination, which is intended to show that when the wind ear has great harm, the abominable can be surrounded by bad people. \\nDoes the leadership of the civil society have any shortcomings in this regard, to my knowledge, there are, some. Chief Wu once said to many people: 'How do you always oppose me'? Does bottom-up criticism of the Cultural Corps take place? Is the democratic air strong? I thought, were there any people who did not carry out, were not strong, and had concerns and dare not to make different opinions to the leaders? Yes, (examples can be found in General Assembly speeches), in such hotbeds, it should be said that it is not possible to emerge leaders. \\nIt is very interesting to be interested in words such as 'easy teeth' and 'Dong Shigang' without objective and actual departure from the center of meaning and group. \\nWell, then I'll start by talking about why you want to use the 'easy teeth' example. \\nThe reason is very simple,From the actual departure from the regiment,The example of 'easy teeth' is very prominent,Shocking,Can cause serious vigilance,'To rise up, need to throw a fierce agent',Only this example was cited at that time, illustrating the seriousness of the downside of the wind,The discussion was not sufficiently clear and comprehensive,But at that time Is to raise opinions, think of a little to mention, not to mention that 'a corner can be reversed' No, nor was it envisaged to make a comprehensive statement. Now you might want to make this classification more detailed:\\nAgreed opinion:\\n(1), without brains, blind affiliation. \\n(2), know wrong, less say better. \\n(3), Knowing wrong, deliberately meet. \\n(4), Based on a common understanding of agreement. \\nInconsistency:\\n(1), One party is self-thought, does not understand or want to know the other party. \\n(2), with unintentional intent, deliberately trick or treat. \\n(3), There is a lack of sufficient arguments and material on both sides. \\nIt can be seen from this that convergence of opinion is just a symptom. It is not possible to measure whether people are close to the party by agreement or not. Being a leader should not simply pursue cheap consensus. It is certainly good not to say agreement, inconsistency is certainly not good; it is normal to go from meticulous to agreement based on correct understanding. At that time, there was only an abnormal agreement, no inconsistency, because the main problems in the regiment were the lack of democratic air, paternalistic leadership, and cheap agreement were more harmful. \\nIs the 'easy teeth' example appropriate? \\nAfter all, any example is an example. Why is it not so entirely appropriate, if the mechanical equals Qi Wang to the Party branch, it certainly is not appropriate. If you think of Qi Wang as a person who likes to listen to the wind and ears, then why is it not necessary? \\nI do not compare all those close to the party as easy teeth, nor do I compare one or two comrades to easy teeth, but how can I compare him to 'easy teeth' for a person with a ghost fetus to approach a leader who does not like to listen to the opposite? It is just a little witch's ear. \\nThis example, I think, illustrates three things: first, there is a downwind-ear leadership, and the second is there a corresponding presence of cadres around the runway ear leadership, the third job suffered losses, what kind of loss? In general, democratic life is not enough, shortcomings in work are not easily preventable or corrected in a timely manner, and if they become serious, people such as easy teeth are cultivated. \\nIf this example is to be overturned, it is only to prove that: First, the civil works corps do not have the right leadership, and secondly, in a society where the class has been eliminated in our country, there can be no scatter of exploitative class. If it is not proved, this example cannot be overturned. \\nDoes it affect the party relationship? \\nBeing close to the Party is a good thing, but it is not equal to being close to the Party with any purpose. It is good to approach the Party with a goal of Zhengda, but it does not mean not to raise the sense of responsibility for work, do not lift personal concerns about the gains and losses. In order to truly safeguard the interests of the Party and do good work, opinions on the first or two situations should be agreed. Change, the third type should be subject to strict criticism. How can this affect party relations? Conversely, the party relationship can be based on the right foundation. \\nTalk about the position\\nIt should stand firm, but the position should be firm from exercise, from independent thinking, on the basis of rational understanding, not dogma (which cannot be worded here), and scary with a position, in fact, this is nothing more than simplifying matters. The simplistic approach is the way, but it is not necessarily a good way. For example, it is hard to say that technology also has class character, and the introduction of Chairman Mao's 'Yanan symposium speech' instead of the detailed concrete measures in the work. What are the benefits of these lovely positions for the work? We should oppose both right-leaning revisionism and left-leaning dogmatism. \\nWho does not know that the achievement is the main conclusion? Put this conclusion on any unit, any work, without a detailed and comprehensive analysis. It will not be difficult, and there will be no loss of position, more beautiful! But what can be done to improve the job? \\nDong Shiguang said 'easy teeth', Dong Shiguang is a right-wing element, and then said 'easy teeth' so he asserts that Dong Shiguang has 'resonated', with 'appetite', the meaning seems to be equal. \\nNow I have used Dong Shiguang once again 'to rise up, need to cast a fierce agent', Dong Shiguang used a fierce agent, which is aimed at medical death, so whether all those who use fierce agents, the rough storms in the blast are doctors who want to heal the dead? \\nWhat is this logic? All men eat, and all that eat are men. \\nThe fight against the right should be carried out, the wind is going to exaggerate slander and wipe out. We want to oppose, attempt to destroy the socialist system, and the conspiracy to abolish the party's leadership must be crushed, but the three hazards that exist must be cleared. We cannot think of the exaggeration of the right-wing elements. We simply deny or ignore the three harm. Existence. \\nAbout grades and disadvantages\\nI think the song and dance group, especially the Yinchuang group, do not necessarily have to be the main achievements. My group's work results are very few, or even have not been carefully summed up regularly, vague and vague, take some results to stuffed, what is the use? Turning to this issue now, I thought first of all that should not be equal to the following questions. \\nFrom the whole country, the achievements are the main, and therefore the performance of the Chongqing song and dance group is also the main. The party's literary and artistic policy is correct, so the specific guidelines of the municipal song and dance troupe under the leadership of the Party are also correct. As long as the train does not depart from the party's fundamental policy, the achievement is the main thing. \\nThe socialist system and the socialist economy are superiority, and thus the work of the municipal cabaret has achieved some achievements, which should also be credited to the troupe. \\nOver the past few years, social movements and political learning, ideological transformation, the party and the regiment have made significant achievements in the construction, and thus the achievements of the Cultural and Cultural Corps are also the main ones. \\nNo! We can't make this equals, if so, we sleep in the arts, and we can also draw the conclusion that results are the main ones. \\nTo measure the performance of the song and dance troupe, we should mainly examine the artistic cause, check how policies are implemented, what specific measures have been implemented, and how the tasks performed are ensured, if not under the leadership of laissez-fame, or with great success, if there is a long-term and comprehensive plan, whether it can greatly exceed Existing achievements, which are likely to address major issues that have not been addressed, Causes big losses? \\nAs time has been long overdue, specific comments in this regard have not been written for the time being.

In 1957, he said: 'Three hazards and personal worship are the products of the socialist system.' 'Light industry in the Soviet Union is not good, and heavy industry is not necessarily good. The United States is the world's first powerful country, with more than 100 million tons of steel production, and the Soviet Union cannot do it. My country's pens were shipped to the Soviet Union and they were snapped out, and they used to use just pencils.' 'The Czech industry can't work, can't compare with the United States, the United States five-ton truck can load eight tons of cargo.' 'America has money, otherwise why do they go to the sea in tons of parabolic goods! There are no starving people in the United States, otherwise our newspapers have caught a small book. What the United States left behind in North Korea, I went to pick up and pick up is also going to be rich. My country simply cannot, cannot compare with the United States, but is only collecting waste.' 'Overseas Chinese allow them to return home and allow them to go out, just pretty. In fact, it can only go forward. This policy is just deceiving!' Advocating 'professors governing schools', the party only manages politics. Wait, was beaten as right-wing elements."},

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】Chen Zongpei: 'A Rightist Reflections and Possibility of a Hero'\\nMr. Qu Chaoyun's 'If Mr. Hu Feng is reused...' article mentions a strange phenomenon that has occurred in our country: not long ago due to reuse and then reused people. Feng Xuefeng and Ding Ling used a barbaric, unreasonable approach to a young writer with a personality, Xiao also shepherd, and was soon overtaken by Zhou Yang. The Pakistani people first turned Nie Guanbow, a writer with both talents and merit in the revolution, into a 'right-wing', later by Zhou Yang and others to promote the 'bourgeois humanism' Wu Han crossed his esteemed Luolongji and Leung Sicheng, and later he was broken by men. It is the conscience of certain people who are in distress. Hu Fengben, a leftist writer, has never been re-used by the revolutionary political parties and the people's government. Not only has he been repeatedly criticized, but also sat for more than 20 years in prison. In the Cultural Revolution, the 'gangs of four' sent people to try Hu Feng repeatedly, mobilizing him to expose his enemies, Zhou Yang, 'for the initiative.' But Hu Feng did not take the opportunity to vent the long-standing resentment. Wouldn't Hu Feng be the whole person? If he was reused the same would be the whole person! How can it be seen? When he himself became a target, he also threw two materials, describing Shen Congwen, Wang Luyan and Zhang Hainshui as 'hostile class figures', and Zhu Guangqian as 'a big pillar inside Hu Shifaction'. If he is reused and in power, he will certainly fight against the other with the means of a brutal struggle! \\nWhoo! Hu Feng fortunately was not reused, leaving the pragmatic, Gao Fengliang festival praise! \\nReading Mr. Qu's article, naturally reminds me of my 'right' Ren tianlin Tianlin's life history and a reflection before his death. \\nRen tianlin Tianlin was originally a party secretary and political faculty member of Fengjie middle school in Sichuan province, and was also considered a 'red man' in the school. When he was reused, he often taught those 'old intellectuals' in a high-profile posture: 'You need to understand the situation. Now it is the communist world, what the Communist Party says to do it!' He was singing 'revolution' high-profile, but who knew he had committed 'bogey'. Later, the big 'right' Chu Anping threw 'right speech' and 'party world', he was accidentally 'held' as the 'grandfather of the party world'. Since the crime covers storage Anping, of course, it has to be weighed. He was tortured in a 'right-wing labour camp', where he was 'hat-picking' and placed in a rural primary school in 1964. \\n'Trees are quiet and wind.' 'Social teaching' is not over, and the wind of the 'Cultural Revolution' has come again. Ren tianlin teacher, this old 'athlete' is naturally the first to blow. The working group finally gathered his 'new crime' that insulted the great leader Chairman Mao: when he spoke of the 'Three Bay Adaptation' lesson, there was a sentence of 'Chairman Mao's tall image...' in the text. He dare to write 'tall' board into a 'tall dog'! What a sin to die! At the beginning of 1966, he was scored in the 'Cattle Depot'. Students in the same class understand the grievances of teachers, and who dares to defend the 'current counter-revolution'? Several of the classmates had to go to the father of Little Ho and asked how old to bring her to the working group to correct and rescue the teacher. How old is the 'social education' activist. Can the cry of several elementary school students shake his position? He's father and son all swim in 'swimming high school', exercise and grow up in the 'big winds and big waves'. He later became the brigade 'director of the Revolutionary Commission', and Xiaoshi later joined the army and raised his work. In the spring of 1976, he was put down by another faction, and was also buckle 'chameleon', 'small crawler' black hat. After he tasted the whole taste, he saw the torment of the teacher, remembering ten years ago, sleepless overnight, the next day went to the school 'deputy director of the Revolutionary Commission' to show the truth about the teacher's 'board book incident': the teacher board book is 'tall', because the blackboard broke a white point Not clean, a naughty student in the class joked that there was a white spot in the upper right corner of the word 'big', much like 'high dog'! He was criticized by a former teacher, inspired by the repeated mobilization of the working group, to reflect to the working group the teacher's board book 'Gao Dog'. Just ask the student or look at the blackboard in the classroom, it is clear that in the age of 'want to add sin, how to suffer', the whole person is 'closely following' 'the great strategic deployment' of 'revolutionary action', and who sympathizes with the 'enemy' and who may be rectified! If the old man does not get the whole, his conscience may never be condemned, and the teacher's 'evil sin' does not know when it will be back! \\nIn 1979, the county's 'right' one was 'corrected', the teacher was 'first' 'party world', not 'wrong', not 'rectified'; in 1980, the teacher was the only 'right' in the region that did not 'correct'. Later, under the coordination of the provincial 'hat-picking office', the teacher's 'right wing' was able to 'rectify'. \\nThe teacher, who has not been smiling for more than 20 years, reproduces his cheerful character. But the injured body could no longer recover and had to retire early in 1985. In 1998, a 70-year-old teacher was diagnosed with advanced cancer! He knew he was not long, and it was natural to reflect on the past. He was lying on the bed and said to me: If I wasn't classified as 'right,' in that series of political movements, I would also be the whole person, and I would step on someone else's head to climb up! I don't know how much 'iniquity' to Because when the 'right' has no chance for the whole person, no longer has done anything against his conscience. I am frank in the face of death, without repentance and no need to ask God for forgiveness! \\nHu Feng, if reused by the whole person, is Mr. Qu Chaoyun inferred; Ren tianlin teacher if he continues to be a 'red man' will also be the whole person, he said to me personally. \\nIn the years of 'continuous revolution', class struggle every day, its policy orientation is: Fire into the party, the party promoted; its slogan is: 'Shut up and dare to pull the emperor down the horse!' Its subtext is: pull down the horse after their own good to replace it! Each sport has a whole person indicator, and the layer plus, is overdone. It will not be possible for the whole person to be reused, after being reused, will use the power of the hands of more people. You are not whole, you will face the danger of being whole at any time, even those who rely on the whole to start their homes a little flashy will be put down. Some people even eat and sleep are thinking about how to whole people or how to avoid getting whole, not only in public speaking to 'play a copy', but also have to be prepared for each other. At the end of each campaign, there is always a group of leavers who are poorly bearish at the end of the campaign, and a group of political rookies celebrate. Don't say that hundreds of thousands of intellectuals 'Zhongyang Mou' have been 'classified' as 'bourgeois right-wing', that is, Peng Dehuai, Liu Shaoqi and other revolutionary predecessors have not escaped the doom of being rectified! \\nFor decades, 'the nation listens to one's command', everyone has acted according to the 'highest instructions', 'conscience' was labeled 'bourgeois', 'fighting with people' has become 'fun', the more ruthless the person 'revolution', the more reused. 'Current situation' has created a large number of 'heroes'! \\nBuddhists believe in karma, and they fantasized that they will rise to the heavens in the future, fear of going to hell after death, and have to 'self-discipline' their words and deeds, and do not dare to lose their hearts. But these are 'seal repair', 'Kong Mengzhi Road', are all 'four old' (old ideas, old culture, old customs, old habits), have long been approved and battered and smelly! Religions who believe in God are dying to confess to the priest and pray for God's forgiveness. Lancém, a famous priest in Lyon, France, has listened to the death of more than 10,000 people, and when he turned 90 years old, wrote a sentence engraved on his tombstone: 'If time goes back, half of the world will be great.' However, in previous years, all the people in our country have received benefits, they will only feel lucky, feel happy, never have a sense of apology, nor will they repent. If time really goes back and reproduces the environment of the whole person, they will also be the whole person! Zhou Yang has not tasted his own taste of getting a whole. Will he go to the hospital to visit Hu Feng and apologize to him after his comeback? Why didn't the old be removed from power by another faction. Will he have a hidden heart for his teacher? \\nThe famous Hu wind and the silent teacher, because the whole person was put down by others, it is unfortunate, but they also maintain the bright character and fall, at the dying without the slightest apology and confession, can talk to masturbate!

In addition to more than 200 students in each class of the 5 students, there were also some young teachers and employees. \\nSome argue that some people are motivated to help the party rectify, but objectively caused the negative consequences of the opposition, such unconscious anti-socialist people cannot be counted as right-wing\\nAt the meeting, Yuan Guansen, using Ren tongsheng's fellow students as an example, said that we admit that the effect of the anti-party newspaper, which is a student, is very bad, but his motivation may be good. He said that when Ren tongsheng Tongsheng wrote the big print newspaper, he had had tears, which showed that his motivation was to help the party rectify. He disagreed with some who thought that the big print of his fellow students was a big print that incited the opposition, on the grounds that under the circumstances, as an ordinary member of the party, it would still be possible to write a big print to call everyone to help the party. Secondly, Ren tongsheng Tongsheng did not understand the policy of the Party Central Committee at that time, and was not clear what remarks were anti-party. Although objectively causing the consequences of anti-socialism, they were unconscious. \\nJiang Changlin agreed with Yuan's argument. He also took Zhang Haiyuan as an example. I admit that Zhang lost his position at that time and played a very bad role, but he was also subjectively to help the Party rectify the wind. He said that after other right-wing elements fabricated the 'Khrushchev's secret report' was posted in large print newspaper, Zhang had rebutted; after the big print of the 'blacklist' newspaper came out, the chapter also posted the big print newspaper saying that it was nothing; he also wrote a large print refuting right-wing, Huang Wanli's 'flower little language'. He said that these show that chapter is defending the cause of the party. If it's an anti-socialist right, why can you still defend the party? Why would you oppose yourself if it was the enemy? Isn't that the subjective desire of the chapter or good? Jiang further said that recently he also wrote poems to the Yangtze River Bridge and artificial satellites, which showed that he was not subjectively anti-socialist. \\nIt was revealed at the meeting that the subjective motive for the same life was also anti-socialist. The so-called tears to write the big print, it turned out to hate the party not to follow his opinion to transform\\nAfter a few minutes of rest, there was a lively debate over the argument that 'the subjectively defending party, objectively opposition'. Li Songtao said that the words and deeds of Ren tongsheng's fellow students are not only anti-party anti-socialist, but also subjectively anti-socialist. He said Ren tongsheng Tongsheng first attacked democratic centralization and party relations in the big press. Ren tongsheng believes that democratic centralization is incompatible with his personality. In order to force the party to reinvent his opinion, he did not hesitate to fabricate a large number of facts, incite and attack. Some say that he writes big print with tears, and in fact, he will shed tears because he hates the party's failure to adapt according to his opinion. Is this motivation good? Li Shuwei spoke about a vivid metaphor at the meeting. He said, it's like a capitalist who hires a poor who does not eat. If we only see capitalists eat him, we think the capitalist is very good, and this feeling and position is obviously very wrong. In his speech, Huang Zhi revealed, what was the subjective motive of being a fellow student during the magnification? Even the Party Central Committee in Beijing and the People's Daily did not believe it, but had to write a letter to Wen Wei Wei, which was instigating anti-party anti-socialism at the time, and asked the newspaper to send reporters to help Tsinghua get the wind. Isn't the essence of this motivation obvious? Duo Huiguang revealed that Ren tongsheng's anti-party sentiment is a long time ago. He had checked: 'Unfortunately, China was leaping from semi-feudal semi-colonies into socialism, and it would be great if it went through the capitalist phase.' From here we can see that the motivation of Ren tongsheng's fellow students is to transform the party into a bourgeois party. Is this helping the Party to rectify? \\nAs Chairman Mao said, 'We are a unionist of the motivations and effects of dialectical materialism. ... to test whether a writer's subjective wishes and his motivations are correct and good, not by looking at his manifesto, but the effects of his actions (mainly works), in society.' \\nSeveral times, through the revelation of his counterpart, Haiyuan, further confirmed that the subjective motives of all right-wing elements are anti-socialist.\\nStudents also used a lot of facts to expose the hypothesis of the so-called Zhang Haiyuan actively rally against the right. Wu Zhiqiang said that when the problem of 'blacklist' occurred, some right-wing elements pointed to the face of the regiment's books and asked whether they answered them or not. Later, the delegation's support book asked Zhang Haiyuan, who was the secretary of the Party branch at that time. He not only did not adhere to the principle of explaining the truth, but he said that it was all the group committee engaged in a classification list. Turn the sharpness to the regiment committee, exonerate yourself. When Feng Guo, the right-wing activist, will aggressively attack the anti-opposition movement in the 'Freedom Forum', some comrades collected information for the chapter, and the Free Forum also arranged for him to order his speech, let him go up and refute, but he refused to come to power, and only said, 'I will exchange views with Feng Guo below' (later not even 'exchange views''). Is this a positive counterright? Wu Zhiqiang also revealed that when right-wing elements posted a fabricated 'Khrushchev secret report' big print, some party members in the class repeatedly proposed to write a big print for rumors. After writing, the title is 'This is a disinformation slander', chapter repeatedly opposed, and finally he changed to 'our opinion', how weak it was. The poem against the 'small language of flowers' is not the initiative of Zhang Haiyuan, but the opinions of everyone. \\nZhang Haiyuan has been repeatedly delayed on the issue of criticizing the right-wing elements for their coexistence. Finally, when the Party Committee pointed out that it should be criticized immediately, he said, 'Let my fellow students look at problems more acute than me,' and should learn from their fellow students. Zhang Hongtao said that during the big magnification of Zhang, Zhang actually called on party members to sign no matter what big print newspaper, and that the Party branch should write big print newspapers to support Ren tongsheng's fellow students. The party that has also slandered our party is 'breaking Wang Jinjing', 'now corrupt.' When the right-wing member Liu Zhuoyun embraces the right party Jin Muyi at the Freedom Forum, many of the students looked very angry, while Zhang Haiyuan said, 'Hug hug what does it have to do!' What is this affection? From these analyses, it is clear that the subjective motives of all right-wing elements are anti-socialist. \\nEnemies are never friends\\nAt this debate, Chen Gongquan argued that repentance rightists can only count the rightists in history. He took Guan Hongye as an example. Guan Hongye gave an account to the organization at the beginning of the anti-right, but also revealed some activities of the 'common people society'. This repentant right-wing elements are not our enemies now. Did not some people in history continue to work for the party after really repentance? Jiang Zukang also believes that repentant right-wing elements cannot count as reactionaries. He said that Guan Hongye has now bowed his guilt and confessed his guilt, thus losing the reactionary nature, so he can no longer be said that he is a reactionary. \\nThe plot of Guan Hongye was serious. During the Great Ming magnification, and the anti-revolutionary grandson, Sun Baotong, started up with a black hand, organized the anti-revolutionary group 'The People's Society' to aggressively attack the electoral system and pursue bourgeois democracy. Seeing that President Jiang was looking at the big print newspaper, he said viciously: 'The president used to be the whole family, and now the whole family was whole, and he could not lift up his head.' He actively supported the right-wing elements in bringing to justice the big word that would put anti-cadres away. For such a right-wing element, if not surrender, continue to recalcitrant, only aggravate his sin. Therefore, no matter how he expresses repentance, he cannot erase his sins, always the right-wing. As to whether or not really repentance, let alone look at his performance for a moment. There is still a long test. Chen Zhenhua said that Guan Hongye was able to deal with some problems because at that time he saw the right party hit back, and the opposition party could not become, and had to deal with it. Xue Dan-zhi said, we cannot underestimate the enemy. Indeed, the enemies are ultimately not friends, and we must not easily believe them. Many right-wing elements have been criticized or even disciplined in the past in the past, but their nature is difficult to move, and once there is a chance, they will still hold up the banner of the opposition and continue to be hostile to the people. \\nRightists are determined by the nature of their class. Time environment can't decide whether a person will fall into the right\\nIs it accidental to turn to the right? Can the time environment determine whether a person will fall into the right? That was another subject that had been debated at the meeting. Liu Zhangye thinks that if Daming magnifies a little longer, there will be more people who become right. He believed that it was like a bus, when caught up, turned to the right, and not the right in line, so he felt that it was accidental to change the right. Some classmates believe that because some people didn't understand the Party's policy at the time, so they said the wrong words and turned into the right. This is also accidental. \\nIs that true? It is not difficult for people to see from the experience of their fellow students and Zhang Haiyuan, they are not accidental. The essence of the anti-socialist ideology of their anti-party anti-socialism was clear long before the wind. When the Zhangluo Union set off a demon against the Communist people across the country, they thought that the time had come, they took a big offensive. Li Songtao said well: because the essence of the right-wing elements is conscientious anti-socialism, and no one forced them, so even if they don't catch up with the bus, the next bus will catch up. \\nThere are indeed various types of right-wing elements, some are shirtless, some are planning in secret chambers, some have used anti-party problems to oppose parties, some attack the party's policies, but in any case, one thing is consistent, then they have a common class essence. Thus, the emergence of right-wing elements is by no means coincidental. Some have not yet been exposed this time, but if they insist on not changing their positions and reforming their ideas, it is certain that one day he will still fall into the mud pit of right-wing elements. \\nWang Zhenhuan, general secretary of the machinery department, and Comrade Ai Zhisheng, party secretary, made speeches at the meeting. Comrade Ai Zhisheng first spoke about why the contradiction between us and the bourgeois right is your death and my living struggle. He said that before the wind, the Party had criticized some misconceptions. Chairman Mao also criticized various wrong ideas in the article 'correctly handling the internal contradictions of the people' and pointed out that intellectuals must be reformed, but the reactionary nature of the bourgeoisie right is difficult to move, still evil The poison carried out a rampant attack against the party. So is it inevitable or accidental to the emergence of the bourgeois right? It is clear that the main factor that produces right-wing elements is because of their bourgeois reactionary nature. He then talked about the fact that all the bourgeois right are reactionaries. He said that regardless of Chiang Kai-shek and the homeland regiment, they were all counter-revolutionary. The same is true of right-wing elements. As long as they are anti-socialist, those who stand in reactionary positions are reactionaries. He said that there is no 'good motivation' of the right, but the degree of anti-party anti-socialism of every right-wing element may be different. We see the issue should have a class position. We should not sympathize with the right-wing elements, we should resolve and them to draw the boundaries from ideologically and politically, and organizationally should give it Appropriate handling. He said that the best basis for identifying right-wing elements is Chairman Mao's six criteria. We cannot confuse political and ideological issues, but from this debate we see further the reactionary nature of individualism. Individualism is not all right, but if they resist transformation, they risk falling into political right-wing elements. \\n(New Tsinghua, January 22, 1958)\\n"},

Hot Processing Five Party Branch by Expulsion of the Right Party (1958.1.22)\\nRen tongsheng Tongsheng was the forerunner of the anti-party during the windy period. While the bourgeois right-wing rampant attack on the party, he hypocritically wiped tears and said he wanted to help the party to rectify the wind. In the big print 'One Party Member's Opinion', he fired a most poison arrow at the party, exposing 'darkness within the party,' and became a weapon for right-wing elements of the whole school to exert pressure on party members. Ren tongsheng was therefore hailed by right-wing elements as 'exemplary party members'. Mr Ren tongsheng viciously attacked the leadership of the Communist Party in his anti-party newspaper. He first slanded the party committee 'unveiled no determination' to 'dodge dodge, and want to return', and described the 'leadership put' that the Party Committee stressed as 'ordering the masses to rectify the party.' And slandered the school to rectify the act and demand the so-called 'real winds'. His more vicious attack on the party's organizational principle, 'democratic centralization', thinks that 'democracy is not sufficient, there is more concentration', 'the leadership's speech is a classic,' and 'the party members have a strong tendency to blind obedience'. He stigmatized democratic life within the party as 'party members are accustomed to being Nono men.' He also maliciously provoked party group relations, arguing that 'the idea of privileges within the Party has risen and bureaucracy is serious', that the party's cadres are 'high-minded classic-style style', 'use their attitude towards sons or servants to rebuke the masses', and even slander senior cadres 'forget the hard life of the past and seek one-sided pursuit 'By', he also cited the fallacy of right-wing attacking the party, asking the party committee to 'immediately admit...' or 'not to recognize mistakes' '. \\nEveryone knows that 'democratic centralization' is the party's unshakeable principle of organization, and the popular line is the party's fundamental political and organizational line. It is not difficult to see from this that Ren tongsheng Tongsheng is firmly standing on the position of the bourgeois to attack the party, trying to transform the Party according to the bourgeois face. It was not enough that he had posted the big print newspaper. He also had to go to the 'Freedom Forum' to expose 'intra-party scandals,' only because there were too few listeners that day, his attempts failed to reach. \\nFrom the reactionary class instinct, he wholeheartedly endorses all reactionary remarks, 'moved' by these reactionary statements. He thinks that Ge Pei Qi's 'Communist Party is dead, China does not necessarily die', 'there is merit,' and that 'the Communist Party mistakes not change it, the people overthrow it' because of Ge's 'good intentions'. After seeing the big print of the attack on our leader, Chairman Mao, he hypocritically said: 'The emotions are very pessimistic... Discontent has been spreading to Chairman Mao by the Party Committee, and trust in the party is getting lower and lower.' He hastily wrote to Wen Wei Po, asking the newspaper to 'reflect' to the Central Committee and asked to send reporters to 'support the liberation'. Why look for Wen Wei Bao? He said this is a 'private newspaper'; and 'People's Daily is a Party newspaper, an orthodox newspaper that will not reflect the truth to the Central Committee.' After the reactionary leaflet 'My worries and appeals', which slandered the Party Central Committee's split on the issue of winds appeared, he immediately incited to say: '90% of the Central Committee did not support Chairman Mao. We all go to support Chairman Mao!' The essence of this slogan is to incite the masses to go to the streets, and the horrific faces of the hostile class who live together are exposed! \\nIt is no coincidence that a man's death falls into the right. Born from a small bourgeois family, he has long been educated by the bourgeois. He envied capitalism's 'democratic freedom' and 'material civilization', arguing that China did not go directly into socialism through a capitalist society is a pity. He disgusted the organization, discipline, he thinks: 'The organization calls you east, you can not go west, there is no room for bargaining', 'My character and joining the party are contradictory' and 'joining the party is self-bound'. But in order to speculate, he was mixed into the party. In 1956, the rise of international revisionism, his revisionist ideology has further developed, believing that party members and the masses will not differ too much in theoretical level, and do not necessarily have to exercise overall leadership over the country. He strongly endorsed arguments such as 'democratic schools' and openly suggested that democratic parties could propose political platforms for election. He believed that the ratio of democracy to concentration had changed over time and that democracy was not enough to adapt to changing circumstances. He particularly appreciates the so-called 'freedom' organization: 'How free is joining the League when the enthusiasm of the revolution is high, and when the revolutionary enthusiasm is low for a few days to rest!' The idea of individualism and revisionism as a fellow student has more than once been criticized and educated within the party, but he refuses to accept it and speak verbally, but he is dissatisfied with the fact that the anti-slander organization of the party is 'not warm.' In this way, he does not go to the Party's education for self-transformation, but he takes advantage of the sharp moment when he enlarges class struggles, and forced the party to accept his transformation of the party. Of course, he hit the bloodshed and became the evil enemy of the party and the people. \\nAll party members of the five branches of the Mechanical Department of Thermal Processing have unanimously agreed that Ren tongsheng's colleagues have always adhered to the reactionary bourgeois position, refuses to accept the transformation, take advantage of the wind to attack the Party in an attempt to change the nature of the party and restore the capitalist system. In order to be serious about the party discipline and the pure party's team, all party members unanimously cleared him out of the party by expelling the preparatory party membership of his fellow students at a branch meeting on the 5th.

Here I will only expose to you the sinister rhetoric and actions of Ren yide of the right-wing elements that have been brought together, as follows:\\n1. Use various timing to spread reactionary speech\\nEither can take advantage of all the opportunities available to discredit the Party's policy, undermine the authority of the Party, and grievances for right-wing and counter-revolutionary elements. When the revelation of the country began, when the right-wing elements launched the vicious fallacy of attacking the party (such as 'the world of the party' and 'foreign party cadres have no authority'), either of them greatly appreciated, and further elaborated for these right-wing statements, 'The People's Congress does not work.' 'Not only 12 deputy prime ministers have no democrats, but there are no democrats in every ministry or department.' And said, 'This is the social reality of these years, and the party itself is a sectarian.' He also took the opportunity to reverse the case for Hu Feng and other anti-revolutionaries, saying: 'Hu Feng is not a counter-revolution, but because of personal stereotypes with Zhou Yang, and as a result, he lifted people up.' Ding Ling was criticized for his mistakes last year, saying, 'This is also a matter of sectarianism.' He praised a poem published in the star poem 'grass', and said: 'Art level is high, poisonous grass is good.' \\nEither of the anti-opposition movements expressed a carved hatred, and slander said everywhere: 'The anti-revolt movement has suppressed people's feelings and played a scene of 'Three Forks'. And said: 'The rebellion was mistaken by the Party Central Committee, but Premier Zhou did not dare to admit at the People's Congress that it is not only wrong, but it is 100 percent wrong.' At the same time, he criticized the party and said: 'The end of the rebellion has not been removed. The people still have to pay me more than 60 yuan for counter-revolutionary activities in a month, and a penny is not enough.' Then arrogant and stubbornly said, 'You are not safe, I am not against; the more you take, the more I am. \\nMoreover, he was dissatisfied with the performance of the entire social system, and he said with great slanderness: 'The new society has no freedom of speech, no real democracy. We spend time in endless meetings every day, distracting speeches, disputes over chickens and garlic, and endless discussions; it is in the queue of time-consuming and error-consuming. Parent-child disease, dispute of neighborhood neighborhood, confusion of relationship between men and women, race for vinegar The life of the ghosts.' And he has viciously discredited the Party's transformation of industry and commerce, saying: 'After the public-private partnership, there are more people to eat and produce fewer people than before the joint venture. This is an artificial contradiction and a system problem.' To further vent its grievances, even say: 'There is no minimum human rights for people today.' And for example: 'I am a member of the Communist Youth League. In the eyes of the masses, it is a party member of the party, but in fact it is an assistant when the party uses it, it is not the masses, and sometimes it is not as good as the masses. The Communist Party believes that it is 'responsible for the people,' in fact it is a human life of grass, knowing that you are a good man, and it is also hard to put you in death by all means. When they did not have a chance, the natural wind was calm, but the power was always able to play, so holding the archives, holding a stick, and even the work became evidence of attacking the party and the government.' And said: 'The anti-town and forbidden books are equal to the burning of the book pit of the Qin Shi Emperor, and even more people to kill and more forbidden books than then.' He litigated that we engage in political movements as an 'ideological torture' inflicted on people's heads. \\nIn addition to the vicious verbal abuse of the Party and the socialist system, either of them is also very dissatisfied with our country's policy of 'pouring the side to the Soviet Union'. As a result, it spread rumors and provoke Sino-Soviet friendship, such as he fabricated and incited, 'Soviet troops are poorly disciplined, raped women in the Northeast, removed machines, and the people of the Northeast are very outraged. Hate.' And said: 'Soviet films are products guided by false theories and are dogmatic.' 'The Soviet Union also has no press freedom, the policy of the Soviet Union terror.' etc. This is not considered, he has to write several film reviews in an attempt to reverse the audience's favors of Soviet films. After the 20 congresses of the Soviet Communist Party Congress, and even since the Hungarian events, his anti-Soviet rhetoric became more arrogant, saying: 'Tito's speech is specific, from the facts, can convince people;' the articles published by the USSR 'The Pravda newspaper,' said, 'The Soviet Union liberated Hungary. After Lee, he chose Rakosi to come to power as a puppet did not do well, and let Gro go to power did not do well, so it happened Hungarian events. 'The Soviet army is also very bad discipline in Hungary,' he said. He said that in the October incident in Hungary, the Soviet troops sent relief, had greatly damaged the self-esteem of the Hungarian people. In short, he tried to make people think of the Soviet Union a mess! Socialist camp mess! Soviet leaders were dismantling each other, and the socialist countries were not united. In addition, and actively opposed learning the Soviet Union, said: 'The experience of Soviet experts is not necessarily good and not worth learning.' 'The people of the Soviet Union are not living high.' MRen yide parties slander and distortion, thereby provoking Sino-Soviet relations. \\nII. Close reactionary relations, formation of anti-party groups\\nLong before the rebellion, either of them had organized small anti-party groups, and later failed because we launched a timely rebellion campaign. After the reversal, either one of them and contacted the friendship of the past, re-formed an anti-party group led by either group, including Shen Runxiang, Wang Aisheng, Wang Yishen and others in the original small group, and developed Chen Renyou, Wang Ying, Guo Chuntang, Du Yuan, Liang Dongyun and mRen yide others. Often together, they actively plan and organize their own publications, spread anti-party and anti-socialist speeches and prepare for troubles, using 'cocktail friends' or 'gatherings'. To check this group of members, more than 80 per cent of the opposition, the rest are people who have historically dissatisfied with the party and have deep class hatred. The aim of developing this anti-party group is, as let yourself say, to become the organizers and leaders of the Hungarian events. \\nThe relationship between either and Wang Wenguang was also established on this basis. Although not long, due to the 'stinous', progress was indeed fast. Since the 'first sight' in May of this year, both sides have shown very close. Either of them immediately wrote to them and put their poison articles in Culture Weekly 'On the front page headlines to be featured prominently, even the big ones let it see. Although some comrades raised objections to the publication at that time, he used 'Wang Wenguang social celebrities' as an excuse to 'climb expensive'. After the duo you come to me, act secretly. On one occasion, Ren actually said to an ally who worked together: 'Your head (referring to Wang Wenguang), came to call, let me go to his house, in the future we will make up a group to live life.' During the Xiqu performance, the two people conducted a preliminary study on the issue of organizing a co-person's publication. Because of the difficulty of the theater, they agreed to go to Wang Wenguang's home after the show. After the performance, Ren Ren Ren visited. In addition to the talk, Wang Wenguang gave detailed instructions to Ren on specific practices, audience subjects and other important aspects such as 'People's Mouthpiece' for his colleagues: 'Party newspapers are too restrictive to publish Ren yidething, to open up a free market, to say that people don't. There is something to say, to be written by others who do not register.' 'The reader must not be too narrow, to seek intellectuals, college students, primary and secondary school teachers, this is a large number of forces, pay attention to rooting among them.' And revealed that the publication in the future can also be given financial support. At that time, either of them said it was a good policy. \\nIII. Organizing a co-person publication\\nIn order to facilitate the incitement of the masses in order to create 'Hungarian events' in China, either of them deeply felt the need to grasp a kind of newspaper. Therefore, during the opera performance, he actively collaborated with Chen Renyou, Wang Ying, Guo Chuntang, Du Yuan and Liang Dongyun, and decided to organize an unintentional co-worker publication. For this purpose, their people, under the command of either of them, actively started activities: as in the editorial colloquium held by WWU, they said, 'The Shanxi Daily has a frame on it, there is a whip below, and the People's Daily is rigid, like a widow's face is not popular.' At the same time, a supplement to the Shanxi Daily, Yungang, which was once coined by Guo Chuntang and Du Yuan, also Dadeng's appeal articles with people, cooperate with each other, arrogant, while negating the achievements of Shanxi literary and artistic circles, while creating contradictions in Shanxi literary and artistic circles, trying to appeal through public opinion, find compassion, and find sympathy. Support, open the way for fellow publications. The more insidious is that, under the instructions of Wang Wenguang, they used all their skills, deceived the leadership of the Party and tried to make their fellow publications a legitimate anti-party position. Either said: 'We don't have the party leadership to do it. If we really want the party to lead it, then why must we do it; so it is best to use them (referring to the party), to play a banner as a guise.' \\nWith regard to the content of the peer's publications, either of them has also made detailed calculations with their fellow people, such as either said: 'In the future, in addition to the rape case, court attendant notes, actors private life, so-called yellow news, in order to trick a wide range of readers, are mainly inflammatory articles, to ironize the general purchase and sale. Line up, to write articles reflecting the bitter life of farmers, students out of school, etc., to expose Various movements have depressed feelings and social insincerity.' Wang Liao said he wanted to write an article to defend the 'Grasswood Article', and either plan to write a 'anti-rehabilitation case'. They are ambitious, plan to start by the weekly magazine, gradually five, three, and the last move and crowded our party newspaper _ 'Shanxi Daily'. \\nEither also said: 'The same people's publications will never appear on the things of Xinhua News Agency. They must not be led by the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. Learn the method of ignition of Wen Wei Po, and should serve directly to incite trouble.' And the statement: 'Little fuss up, we will vigorously propagate; big fuss up, we send reporters to actively participate, write 'accompRen yideing notes', 'witness notes', write 'character close-up', with large title issued in a prominent position.' \\nConspiracy activities in the Cultural Weekly\\nAfter working in Culture Weekly, either of them carried out a series of conspiracy activities, first of all, in actively reforming the established guidelines of Culture Weekly. He said: 'Culture Weekly is a publication dedicated to intellectuals from workers and farmers,' he said. Therefore, it is very annoying to the manuscripts from the masses and the works to complement the political tasks in rural areas. They are often not published on the pretext of 'oiless' and other pretexts. However, the reactionary right-wing Wang Wenguang, Panshukou, Wang Muren and their people's manuscripts are extremely welcome, even regardless of the acceptance and understanding of the masses. Whether or not, they are posted on important pages. So, as either of them said: 'Culture Weekly has almost become a fellow publication through my hand!' This has resulted in a significant loss of quality of publications and a significant decline in the number of subscribers in rural areas. \\nSince the liberation, either felt 'organic can ride', organized everywhere its 'co-man' writing, and specially prepared articles on ignition and incitement, worse is that he does not hesitate to use 'plus title', 'makeover' and other means to expand the shortcomings and create contradictions. For example, in order to deny the party's achievements in the improvement of the middle road for several years, the original title was deleted and changed to 'Middle Road Clapper is behind!' of the title, attempt to incite; as in the dialogue theatre comrade Fang Yan wrote a short article written by Comrade Fang Yan in the Repertory Theatre, added 'the head of the subjective, the actor is pressed, the contradictions within the Repertory Theatre are endless', 'actors small or big, all with the head of the delegation' and other headings are not less than a dozen, and the right Face-to-face, counterattack right-wing manuscripts, they deduct a dogmatic, conceptualized hat, and even arrogant to 'Culture Weekly has no anti-right task,' the author says. \\nDuring this period, either of them to actively organize the ignition, inciting manuscript and run around, such as saying to the provincial song and dance compRen yide Feng Yutan: 'Write your contradictions quickly, expose, you write, and also motivate others to write.' \\nTaken together, it is not difficult to see that either of them has gradually changed the Culture Weekly as their 'fellow publication'. \\n(5), Planning to organize literary clubs and conspiracy to set off Hungarian events in China. \\nAfter the events in Hungary, either of them cheered each other with their group members: 'This is a democratic movement in Hungary.' He also expected a Hungarian incident in China; later when he heard some of the troubles in the country, he felt 'the time has come', and immediately in the press room of the Xiqu Observation Movement Association, with his group members Guo Chuntang, Du Yuan, Wang Ying, Chen Renyou and other secret literary clubs. At that time, Ren enthusiastically said: 'Right! Get a club! Pedofi style, the Hungarian event is Pedofi Club up, this kind of club is a great role!' 'Shanxi Ming put down, it will be a Hungarian event! Anywhere in the future, we will send reporters, make big news.' And said: 'Don't lightly look at the pens of the literary people, Hungarian events are made up by cultural people!' Later, during several gatherings at the hotel, he further analyzed the possible Hungarian events in China, and decided to organize a Pedofy-style literary club to be used as a headquarters and nerve hub to lead the instigating events, and planned to use the co-persons' publications. Instigating the fire, then under the guise of organizing manuscripts, in the field to pull intellectuals, and then develop longitudinal in the name of the same person Relation, in the name of the special correspondent, set nails in various units to spy on intelligence and sowing the fire. They proposed to be located in the Haizibian CPPCC or on the May 1st Square Art Museum building, and they need to install a telephone in order to contact them in a timely manner. At the same time, we need to carry out in-depth social activities, hold lectures, expand the influence of journals and people, and focus on stirring up anti-party sentiments of unemployed people and out-of-school youths. The time is ripe to rise, overthrow the Party's leadership, bring down socialism, and let the captivated capitalist society be restored in China. \\n(vi), Attitudes towards the movement\\nEver since the whole wind, the attitude of either is always unhonest. At the beginning of the movement, he used various occasions to carry out vicious attacks on the party and leadership, such as saying: 'I am not afraid of fighting against me. What can the anti-right party do me?' Get sick leave, attempt to pass customs clearance, and then seal the rebellion, recalcitrant. However, in recent months, the masses put the facts, presumably, and under the tight pace and the poor pursuit, he had to reveal some of his own anti-party activities, the organization of Pedofi Club and other issues, but what he gave was not transparent, and his personal words to his own important opposition activities and Wang Wenguang's private house words with Wang Wenguang On specific issues, they still perform dodge and dodge, avoid heavy weight, even pretend to calm, play tricks, and continue to confuse the masses , the insider and club and other organizational activities that disguise his relationship with his backstage boss Wang Wenguang in an attempt to hide those untold and not to give honestly to the people. \\n[Determined to defend the socialist literary route', written by Wenlian of Shanxi Province, Taiyuan City Wenlian Data Room]\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"}

In this way, our party is stronger, more consolidated and stronger.

Associate Professor Ren said: What are the root causes of the 'three harm', there are many published in the newspapers. The roots of the three harm are gradually spreading from the growth of mentalism. The idealism of idealism is very serious both inside and outside the party. It comes from within the Party, especially from the Party Central Committee, but we never deny communism, society. Achievements of the building of the doctrine. A mentalist approach to thought, constantly growing. Associate Professor Ren also gave examples of dogmatism and empirism in learning from Chinese medicine and embracing the medical heritage of the motherland. \\nHe said that initially there were Wang Bin and He Cheng. They say that traditional Chinese medicine is 'feudal medicine' and that it is wrong to deny it. The Central Committee also corrected, and vigorously studied traditional Chinese medicine. The first was left and the latter was right. The Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine was established, and the ancestral secret recipe was also announced, cupping around. TCM is experienced medicine, not theoretical, it differs from mathematics, physics, some TCM is completely thoughtful. For example, with protective therapy to treat appendicitis, so it's not like it. \\nMany things have taken a mentalistic approach, and we advertise Marxinism and, in fact, trafficking idealism.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attachment 2】Ren Ren yongzhong: 'Meticulism's Working Methods Growing Flooding: Speech at Shenyang Municipal Council' (1957.6.1)\\nChairman, members, representatives:\\n'I wholeheartedly support the campaign of rectification carried out vigorously in order to properly deal with the internal contradictions of the people, according to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. I would like to make the following comments in the spirit of the Patriotic Party and helping the Party to rectify the wind. Errors want to be corrected. \\nFirst, the idealism of working methods is growing and flourishing. \\nTake Shenyang Medical College's first counterproductive work in 1955 as an example to illustrate this problem. Lack of in-depth and detailed investigation before counteracting. After receiving counteractions from their superiors, not to specifically study the political and historical situation of medical schools in the past and at the time, the vast majority of people who had political and historical problems in the past (referring to teachers), were targeted, first by subjectively affirming as a counter-revolution, and engaged in an insane struggle. What about the result? Genuine counter-revolutionary and disproportionate arrests, more disproportionate to those arrested and fought. It is now known that the vast majority of such people are the object of rehabilitation. Whether this approach is somewhat similar to the 'bold assumptions, careful evidence' advocated by mentalists. \\nThis time there are many problems of rebellion. Achievements were indeed the main nationwide, and a number of counter-revolutionary elements had been identified. It provides good political conditions for national agricultural cooperation and the transformation of capitalist businesses. So that the enemy can not flourish, but there are some problems in our academy. It is not only the old teachers, but also among young students. It is not only historical and political issues in the fight against it, but also the words and actions of Pinyin have become important data. \\nWhere are the root causes of these phenomena? One of them, I think, is that the principle of preference in political movements is at work. In normal times, as long as it was not counter-revolutionary, but when political movements were reached, there was a very tense situation. This tension sometimes creates a sense of terror and illusion. It has even temporarily lost the ability to identify what is wrong. So once one thing has been raised, non-party people do not dare to come up with another view. Otherwise, it is inevitable that even party members temporarily think that it is 'right leaning', or 'the mind is wrong.' In this way, the invisibility contributes to the development of shortcomings and mistakes. Cannot be corrected in a timely manner. Recall the major sports in the past not all to rectify it? I think that's the truth. The reason I think is that in the political movement, some party leaders have mechanically moved a preach from Chairman Mao's visit to the Hunan peasant movement. That is, 'Overkill must be overdone. But it is not overkill'. That principle was completely true at that time. Because it was millions of years of oppressed peasants acting under the leadership of the party to riot against the ruling class. Without creating a sense of terror, the peasants cannot exercise absolute power or break down the dominance of their rulers. As a result, the mighty and domination of the enemy were killed and the courage of the people to fight against the enemy. It is the reactionary ruler who has been hurt under the 'right', and the people who have revolved up. \\nBut today, when the people's power has been firmly established to bring about 600 million people and mobilize all the favorable factors to build socialism, the main contradiction in the country is not a contradiction against me, but within the people. The principle that overkill must be used mechanically, and it is the people themselves, not the enemy, who has suffered damage under the right. Although hit the enemy in rebellion, it also hurt the people themselves. Originally, in the past movements, the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are very clear. Everyone has always advocated, and has always argued that it should be realistic and unmistakable. But in fact, as a result, although there are individual right-side areas, it seems that in the past newspapers there are more left cases. In particular, this rebellion movement. I do not believe that such an authorization can be seen despite the fact that the superiors have no instructions to overkill in political movements. But in essence, the principle that overkill must be overly positive is in play. It should be used in the same way as the wind and rain in the whole winds movement to act correctly according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, and not to adopt the principle that overkill must be overly correct in order to ensure that there are no defects and mistakes in future movements. Only in this way can it be solved. In addition to the concerns that people have accumulated over a long time. \\nSecond, how to demolish the wall and fill the problem\\nAt the top of the three bad, sectarianism is sectarianism, which stands out by the existence of walls and ditches between parties and outsiders. On the wall digging the trench, the Communist Party plays a leading role, and the regiment plays the role of an assistant. The outside party people are only on the wall hook and brush, shifting the grass to the ditch to divert water. Therefore, the Communist Party has to play a leading role in breaking down the wall and filling the ditch. Under the leadership of the Party in some of the processes of demolishing the wall and filling the ditch, the outside party should and can also play an active role. I look at the whole wind can play this role. But it is not accidental why the wall was built and ditch excavated. I think that while breaking down the wall, we should study the historical conditions that created the wall and its political and economic basis, and to eliminate the wall fundamentally. Otherwise, the demolition of the wall and fill the ditch may appear a few years later, when the same wind is inevitable. Lenin's principle of building a party, proposed by Lenin around 1920, was fully in line with contemporary historical conditions and the political and economic foundations of that time.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached] Ran deyu story/Tan Song finishing: 'Husband-shot, daughter-starvation' (June 13, 2002 /Changshou Lake Farm Children's Secondary School)\\nHear that you are interviewing, my granddaughter called me not to say, This life has suffered from decades of sins, and even tired of her, do not suffer again. I practiced Falun Gong, and they firmly prevented me from practicing, to make trouble, and I would not practice it. What happened in the 50s, I was not making up, saying a few words, and what kind of faction made me? And give me those two hats (landlord, right-wing)? \\nI am Fuling Reef Rock Township. My father died only four months from birth. I read to junior high school, in Fuling female. Married after graduation, parents were engaged to us from an early age. Her husband was Yang Zexun, 1 year younger than me, and studied at Fuling Provincial High School. \\n10 days after my marriage, I left home and went to my husband's house-Fuling Qingxi Farm. I taught at Nantuo Central Primary School in Qingxi Farm. \\nBy 1950, I had four babies, my boss, 7 years old, the youngest and half years old, was eating milk. On that summer vacation, the peasants asked me and my husband to concentrate on learning, and the husband was teaching at that time. They took him up to the zone and didn't want me to go because I dragged four babies. My husband said to me when he walked, I had no problems, I had no land and certainly would not be rated as landowners. \\nThe peasant association organized a meeting, first ranked me as a free man. The next day asked me to stand up to the bunch of farmers. On the third day, you stood there. 'Over there' is the landlord and the landlord's origin. I said, I upgraded again, three days. I did not realize the horror of the local owner when I said that. I think, I have no fields and no land. Although there are a few acres of land, I've left home long ago, my mother died a few months after my marriage. I'm a man, the landlord?! \\n'You teach is not labor, it is exploitative class,' said the Farmers Association. \\nThey came to plunge their homes and suddenly came in the middle of the night, first rushed our mother and child five from the bed, and rushed outside to stand up, they turned the box inside, and a little better things were needed. There is a bed covered, the cotton is not good, the face can also, they remove the face to take away. I weren't wearing clothes for a few of my babies, crying cold. I do not rush in and grab the clothes that my baby wore. Those people picked up a few burdens and went away. The most deficient thing is that they locked the house not to allow us to enter, our mother and son had to drill into a shed next to the stove room. (Mao Zedong praised the 'ruffiff spirit' of the Farmers Association as early as in the Hunan Peasant Movement Trip Report.), \\nThat bed farmer will not look at the cotton flocker, is our only winter cover, I gave four children cover, I don't undress at night, curled on the valley haystack. Cotton soon more broken, everywhere holes, I don't even have rope, with grass to pull the hole around. \\nIn fact, cold can be quite over, hungry belly is called annoyed. My husband got no news, I was not allowed to teach, and I was not allowed to go out-the armed men of the farmers' association said that in order to prevent the enemy from destroying land reform, access passes are required. I am the landlord and I am not allowed to go out, my family has no financial resources. My three daughters were starving to death at this time. \\nThat night, she 'Mom's' cried overnight. 'Mom, I want to eat yo, I want to eat yo. You go to cook for me.' I said, where is rice, the stove is also sealed. Her brother and sister were hungry, red potato rattan, bran baba are eaten, the smallest one has milk hanging down, only this old three, not small, not to eat. She cried all night, and she said, 'Mom, you go to Grandma and give me a drink.' I said, 'It's late, everyone else's doors are blocked.' Daughter didn't call again. Before dawn, she died in that shack and was less than 3 years old when she died. \\n(Note to the author: This is the second time I listened to Ran deyu about her three daughters's death. The first was on November 25, 2001 in a hotel at Lion Beach. That time, in the presence of many people-Li Ningxi couple, my sister Tan Zhu, friend Wang Kang, and so on-Ran deyu tears, crying. This time, she just silently wiped tears.), \\nI went to work, looking for a relative of my husband's family. I shouted her five moms. Her family commented on Zhongnong farmers. I pushed at her house and pushed to 12 o'clock every day. She gave me half a liter bag valley, I want rice, she does not give, every day is a bag. \\nFarmers will give me a piece of land, ask me to plant, I don't want it, I have no money to buy seeds. Farmers will say, hey, you blame, someone else turned over, divided land happy, you don't. So I said I was a 'turn over landlord.' ('Turn over' means getting liberated when the master means.), \\nOur mothers and children had only the clothes that had been taken out of the farmers' association that night, and had not changed them, wore for half a year, and dirty and smelly. Speaking of it is not afraid of you laughing, our whole family is lice. No way to bite, I burn a pot of water, close the door, strip off, put clothes in the pot and boil, floating a layer of lice on the water, my eldest son caught a full handle. I'm not talking about it, not salt and vinegar, I only say that it is missing. \\nSomeone looked at me tough, quietly said: 'You went out to borrow some money to plant the land.' I said, 'Don't give me a pass, I don't dare to go.' He said, 'You do not walk the road, walk the trail at night.' I did as he said, quietly ran to Qingxi Farm to find my three aunt. She gave me two liters, 3 bucks. I bought the buckwheat with these 3 bucks and planted in the soil, huh, very good. I took it back, the baby did not eat, said black paste was cat shit. I ate it to them, they barely followed it. \\nI go out to help every day and let my son take care of the little ones. The son is going out to fetch firewood, and no one's younger sister. One day I came back and found two daughters missing-they were stolen! I was anxious and crying, the farmer will not open a pass, I can't go out, where to find it?! Do you ask the baby dad? He is no longer there! (19), 50 years that summer vacation he was taken to the district, and I never saw him again. Then I heard my sister saying that she saw it with her own eyes-the farmer would grab him and said he was counter-revolutionary. Ask a person to go up and fight him. The man said, Yang Zexun, the village Dam head saw the baby who grew up, reading books, usually good to people, Sven, kind and polite. The farmer will not want that person to say, to come up for another person, the newcomers still say this way, and three people said Yang Zexun was a good person. The farmers' society had to fight and simply sentenced him to death. Killed a number of people that day. Yang Zexun kneeling on the ground, ribbons, armed (personnel), at his back head buckle trigger, not even buckle three shots. Yang Zexun turned back, they said, he thought he was only accompanying the killing site. That armed panicked, and Lien said, 'Yang Zexun, I do not want your life, not I want your life.' \\nThe farmer will change the person, 'They still beat him to death!' (Speaking here, Ran deyu's old man suddenly raised the voice, unusually outraged.), \\nHe was 28 years old when he died. He hasn't done a little bad thing! He was a primary school teacher since childhood, and later he said that he was a counter-revolution because he was a little clerk in Fulingdi Town Section for several months after he graduated from secondary school, transcribed, a child of a student who came out of school, and killed people as a counter-revolution?! \\nMy toughest day was the Spring Festival of that year. Which year? Can't remember. It was the Spring Festival after the two women were stolen, probably 1952, and the 30th day of the year, they sent people to inform me that they were not allowed to go out to work for 10 days. I immediately panicked God, my family was destitute, and nothing eaten. At night I held a hold of firewood, cut into strips, the eldest son helped me pick up, I said to him, tomorrow morning you get up to send firewood (meaning to send money), others will definitely give you some food. Son promised. \\nThe next day his son took up firewood, and his feet were just going out, not to do it. He said, 'Mom, I don't go, and another one will say I'm called Hanako.' I said, 'Not for food, you go to five mothers and three auns, and they are relatives.' And the son went to the door, and as soon as he came to Menkham, he could not lift his feet, but he could not go out Pulled four or five times, he cried and asked me to go. I said, it's better for your baby to go, I'm an adult. He still didn't go, I was angry, and he said, 'Okay, okay, I go! I go! I go out and will not come back.' Son, shocked, cried, he poured over and hung me down, 'Mom! Mom! You have to come back!' (Ran De Yu old tears, cry while saying.), \\nAnd I said to my son, You see what's not eaten in the house, you want to starve to death? That old man told me to marry him, have food, do you want my mother to marry?' \\nThe son said no, but he still couldn't get out, and finally I went. Five Moms, they gave sugar, soup and baba, and returned the firewood to me. \\nThose 10 days were the most panic days of my life. My life's suffering would not add up to that 10 days, two daughters were gone, and the remaining two sons could no longer starve to death. Hurry up, hurry up, after a good year to go out to live. By the night of the 10th day, I pulled my throat and shouted out, 'You want to starve our mother and child to death, no! We came alive and did not die!' \\nMy granddaughter asked me not to say, I said to you, this is my personal experience. I did not say a wrong word, I did not wronged the Communist Party. I had only to say less, said the missing. \\nAmong the armed (personnel), of the group of peasants who killed my husband, there was a man named Peng Yizi, who previously did not work, played idle, had a chatman (no money), could not get a daughter-in-law, went into the farmers' club, he was angry, and he walked around with a backstick gun. He looked at me, to someone. I'm angry and roar: 'Take my man and want to come to me?!' There was a meeting, and others said it again. 'Huh, I have this blessing!' I got up and rushed to him on the spot and said: 'You are good, you are a poor farmer, I am the landlord, what position are you standing?!' \\nHe then leaned Tian to my field, and he walked around and wanted to bully me. People went to this heart too, I'm not afraid of him, jump up and fight him, I said you dare to shoot me down?! He did not account for cheap. \\nI could not plant food, I could not pay the food, and the team who came above asked me for the reason, and I gave them the situation. I asked to go out to find work and ask them to help open the pass. The people of the working group agreed. Peng Qianzi also wanted to card me and wanted to force me to marry him, but the people of the working group nodded his head, and he couldn't stop me. \\nI intend to go to Chongqing No. 1 Middle School to find Ran Shufang. She is my aunt and a classmate of my female. She studied college and taught sports in one middle school. I don't have money, a relative bought me a boat ticket. I entrust my little son to my cousin, and she is also a landlord, and the older son handed over to her grandmother. The older son had to go with me, and he said he went to help people bring the baby. I said, one more person wants tolls, Mom's tolls are paid separately. I left him hard and he cried very sad. \\nI took the boat to Chongqing, I don't know where Shapingba is, a good distance, asked the roadside to Shapingba to walk, went to Hualong Bridge when it was dark. I feel confused in front, go a while, see the mountains in front, nobody, I fold back again. The feeling of no way to go ah. Later I wrote a word and read it to you:\\n'Fu Shan Qing, YuShan Qing, Qingshan on both sides of the Straits greeted, who knows the country. Niang Tears, Tears Ying, Bone and Meat Separation Broken Soul, Tear Sea Heart is difficult. \\nI found a barber shop in Hualong Bridge and asked them if they wanted to work. That boss weighed me for a while and took me down. I spent half a month at that barber shop and the boss looked at me, he died his wife and wanted to marry me. I do not want to think of the baby in the countryside. When I left, the boss gave me a month of pay, and said that if there was no way, I could go back. \\nI found my aunt Ran Shufang in one, and I lived at her point and went to apply for the Rapid Teachers School. By the time of notice, I think the baby wants to die and can't help but go back to see. Aunt said, you left, the notification came to do it? Put the baby first. I said, no, can't put it down. \\nBesides, my eldest son. After I left he lost his soul, often ran out for no purpose to find me. Once he went far away, he went to a relative's house and asked them to help find his mother. The relative did not care about him, but only gave him two burned red soas and told him to go. He still got to go back there? He spent the night out in a haystack alone, he's a baby, not afraid? He must cry. \\nThe elder son began to get sick, and the road did not move, and for more than a month, his body fell down. \\nI went back to the country, the elder son was happy to see me! He said, 'Mom, are you back?' I said, 'I come to pick you up and take you out.' He immediately survived and sick. I had to find a person back to him, said good back to the river for two bucks of labor. As a result, he didn't want people to back and jump alive. I knew I didn't spend those two bucks, but someone else walked away. \\nOn the boat I bought a bowl of rice for my son, and he said, 'Mom, what about you? You also buy a bowl.' I said I didn't want to eat. Where I don't want to eat, I'm hungry, I don't have money! Five yuan was given by Yang Changren, a female student, already used two. (Ran deyu tears drip again.), \\nI brought my son to a middle, and his son was tattered and a long one. Aunt said, this is school. Where else can people see you? She took 6 blocks and told him to go outside. \\nSon to the section to hammer stone, 5 dollars a month, section on a subsidy, finally got a bite to eat. \\nAt this time, I listened to the letter, my little son who was placed in my cousin's family rolled to the latrine (toilet). Fortunately, the toilet was newly repaired, not much manure, he called inside, only took him up. \\nOnce I listened to Fuling, I had lost two daughters, my son could not go wrong anymore. I went back to the countryside and took my little son back to Chongqing. Aunt me: 'You don't have to work, panicked Zhang put the baby up one by one, find some burden.' And I said, 'Your babies are born and father and mother, and we're all mom.' \\nThis time, the notice of the quick teacher came. The aunt said, 'Look, do you do it?' \\nI had no way. I had to send my little son back. When in Fuling, met a relative, she said, you do not go back, send back the baby poor, there is a boat worker on the river without a baby, always wanted to adopt a, put his son to him. I hesitated for half a day and agreed. The boatman surname Zhang, two people very like the baby, immediately made two new clothes for the baby, also warmly hug him. They asked me to write a formalities, and they asked me to take my son's account. \\nWhen he broke up with his son, he cried and said to me, Mom, come and pick me up. \\nI sent my little son, I returned to Chongqing and entered into a speedy teacher reading. Teachers are provided for money, eat no money, but also send some household items. Originally speaking and reading worked for a year, later it was too fast to read for another year. I asked for a job from the principal, and I said I had a baby, financially difficult. The principal did not agree. I had to read it again. This reading was read until 1957. \\nI didn't say a word. At the end, activists asked me to speak. They said, 'You don't help the party to get the wind? You don't speak, politically want to score 2 points?' I said I had nothing to say, and they guided me: 'You have come from the countryside and have experienced land reform, you are coming out of one, and you can say what you see and hear.' \\nSo I said one thing I heard about during the land reform: a wealthy farmer later named a landowner, he was scared, hanging himself. Someone went to him for a meeting, pushed the door and saw the dead, horrible. They also asked me to say, I said about my three daughters, and I cried when I mentioned her. I cried while I said, she died starved during the land reform. \\nThey criticized me and said that there were starvation in the new society after liberation? You slander rumors! I cried and said, 'It's true, my own daughter, do not believe you go to understand, and not far.' \\nI had a crime: 'attacking the Party's land reform movement,' and wearing me a hat: 'Rightists.' \\nOn the road to Nantong rural labor transformation, I walked while crying, I didn't have a penny on my body. Others can also buy some household goods, I go so far, and worry about the baby. The people who led the team asked me why my son was so sad. I said I didn't have the economy, I didn't have to live a job, and a baby. He said, it didn't matter, there was an organization, and I wanted me to rely on the organization. \\nI work honestly in the countryside of Nantong. In one, a teacher with a high name also came. He said that the eldest son had children in his house. Now he didn't need it, whether he sent his son to Nantong. I hurried to him, 'Teacher Gao, you help people to the end. You see me like this, this big hillside, what does the baby do?' \\nTeacher Gao asked someone to introduce my eldest son to 8 Lieutenant Colonel to work. Later he kept doing that until he retired a few years ago. \\nIn 1961, we all went to Changshou Lake and met Li Changwen in Changshou Lake, we got married, you know. \\nI said that looking for my two daughter, the one that was stolen, she was only four years old when she was stolen, and it was almost 20 years since I went to find it. Changshou Lake fishing farm gave me a certificate, I didn't go far to prove that the money was stolen. The second time to go again. My daughter was stolen by people in our area. I know that someone told me that the family was last named Summer, and they stayed in Qingxi Farm for a week after they stole it, see if I could not find it. \\nI asked from that ditch, door-to-door asked and walked, I only knew the family name summer, and I didn't know where to live. Finally, some people said, Xia Jia made a little girl back then, and now the girl is married, right on the slope to the door. Uh, that's not, that is your son-in-law! \\nI hurried up and said to him, I am his woman's mother. Son-in-law listened, and called me to call my daughter. Not a while, came a group of women. Someone shouted: 'Xia Yubi, your mother has come.' I do not recognize her, she can't recognize me. My second daughter is Yang Yunxia. I shouted: 'Yunxia, Yunxia.' \\nWoman heap with a big belly pregnant woman came up and I saw her look like my eldest son. She called me a 'mom.' The two of us cry headaches. A woman next door followed crying, she was also stolen, she cried while saying: 'I don't know what my mother's name.' \\nSome people said, 'You find your daughter and take her away.' Of course I think I'm going to get away for reason, it's what they stole it from me. But she is no longer alone. She is pregnant with a second child, and will be born that month. Her brothers and sisters east, one west, died, sent, sent, suffered very much. She suffered again, her husband's baby was in a bunch, why should she tear her house apart again. Farmers are farmers, and eat safe for work, why not just get a city account. Others say I opened up, I said I tasted enough of the bitter separation, and then she didn't read a book, how to go out? \\nIn fact, my two girls were very smart when I was a child, and I could recognize more than 300 words when they were two years old. She was stolen to the summer house, the man married another wife, and the woman also married. The two women lived with the grandmother of the summer family, worked from an early age, went to bring another baby, she suffered a lot of beatings, she suffered very much. Later, however, her two babies got out of the countryside. (One of the daughters who asked Ran De-yu not to interview me.), \\nMy daughter sent me to the Yangtze River, and we cry another headache on the boat. \\nBy the way, and my little son, he came to Longevity Lake with his girlfriend in the 1970s. Others told him that Longevity Lake was a labor farm. He thought there was barbed wire and a sentinel. I saw him and recognized it at a glance-he looked exactly like his dead dad. \\nAt Longevity Lake, I was almost completely dead. Lo Yumber died before my eyes, and I was just a little bit behind her. Recall this life, I do not know that I live to this day. For decades, I have been cursing myself 'I am a landlord, the right, I want to transform', 'I am guilty', 'I am guilty', 'I am guilty. \\nI said I heard you all my personal experience, not a messenger. Look, where is my sin? \\nRecall this life, I wrote the first oil poem, is a summary:\\nTwo small teaching without the soil, misdrawing ingredients into landlords. My children were dispersed, and I fell desolate in the village. \\nAnd the rain was right for twenty-seven years, and twenty-seven suffered from my family. Admire the hometown of other hometown, red Yan old river and lake. \\nNote: ① 'two elementary teaching' refers to Ran, Yang two primary school teachers ② 'rain right wind' refers to landlords, right\\n(Tan Song, Changshou Lake: 1957 Chongqing Changshou Lake Right Party Interview, Trafford Publishing 2011), (Interview: June 13, 2002 Venue: Changshou Lake Farm Children's High School)\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 2"}

And this feeling is as always: 'a leaf empty street, sitting alone lamp deep' is its persistence, 'reading not much, meaning unknown' is its mood, 'loud voice, elephant invisible' is its longing. Life is born in the world, can dance in the 'chest mountain high water far, pen end cloud wind mania', is tantamount to the quiet of one side of the Eden garden, thoughts galloping a wide Han Palace.

More than twenty documents remain to be collated. The world is arrogant, Buddha wish true, cow dog outside the road, foreign help Buddha Humble in poetry to return the wind and dust, it also has no regret. \\nThis is a brief introduction that I plan to print on the title page of my work. Regarding my age, the file was born on December 14, 1937. This does not match. The reason is that in 1952, the age requirement for admission to the teacher training school is 15 years old, and there is no secondary school exam in the nearest county. I'm crying my nose because I'm not old enough. After the teacher knew the situation, he said it was not just a crooked head. So adding two years old becomes December 14, 1937, and this December 14 is a lunar calendar, so the actual year of birth is January 22, 1944. After graduating in the summer of 1995 as a village teacher, he was actually said to be a child when the 'right' died in 1957. \\nWhy did I die 'right'-\\nThat was about 1956, a young production captain drank good alcohol, often went to school for a night, and of course it was paid by teachers. The wages were low, and no one had to generously contribute to his support for a long time, so one day and night only to draw lots. To whom the lot is written, I do not know yet. Because at that time, I was burying my head to write a long novel, 'Bright Avenue'. Although I did not eat alcohol, there was no good exception, because I could not join the Communist Youth League, and could not work out of the crowd. Wait for the production captain to put a piece of paper in front of me, I reach out and wait for him to open, say 'heaven'. It is the heaven's own diatom 95, the largest official rank, in accordance with its lot rules, and the money to buy wine is natural and righteous So two yuan, a bottle of shochu and two pounds of dim sum, all around the crowd, and sent this night with a sound of color. In the winter of 1995, the Nanjing Military Officer School came here to enlist the army in order to pursue their studies. At that time, we found the Ministry of Education of the County Committee and the County Education Bureau, not let go and cry the nose. In the end, a medical examination was promised, and the leaders were also very satisfied, but eventually did not allow them to go, for reasons such as teachers were not allowed to study various types of schools, teachers were not allowed to leave their posts. In these two cases, when the wind and the right fell to the hands of an activist Yan, they were fabricated as 'claiming to be the day, to usurp power into the army and become emperor, subvert the proletarian dictatorship, and implement the rule of feudal dynasty.' \\nWith this fabrication first, it is not surprising if you want to add sins to the wall of eloquence. Curiously, at the time of the rehabilitation, the personnel concerned found the original fabricated falseers asking their original commission, and actually said that everything was forgotten and clean. In particular, to ask about another issue that was not mentioned at the time of the anti-right uncritical, namely, the appalling testimonies written in the file which it falsely wrote, is that I was 'once the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day in which Mao, Zaizhu, Zhai Zhou, the killing of the Communist Party...' Kill Mao, Zhai Zhu, Zhai Zhou... Fengtian Carriage Juyi Liangshan Park, big exhibition of one hundred and eight general living wish and macro map...' Only fear falling down the stone is not dead and then down the stone, asking why this testimony into the file is also a question. Why did it appear in the file that was not mentioned at the time of the fight? Superiors do not know, batters do not know, the leader can not do not know? Why are they doing this? Show grades? Framing is not ruthless enough? In order to find out what was wrong, more parties had to be visited, but nothing was said about it. After the County Party Committee convened an expanded meeting for the congresses to discuss, the party determined that it was all one person to expose one person's testimony, lacking time, place, physical evidence and circumstantial evidence, and the party decided to correct it. Recently, he met with the same person who had been framed right together, and repeatedly speculated that if no team had intervened, it would only be this activist fire line into the party and then put up the 'anti-counter office'. The 'right' case is said to have been dealt with by this office again, again fabricating false and stuffing his writing into the archives, and its conditions are not It is not unique. This may be the case, but the most defamation can be done, has long been invited by Hades Laozi, at this time can only become addicted. But why would people be so poisonous? It is the classmates and colleagues who are false victims. Usually brothers and brothers are not separated from each other, then why are three teachers in a school framing a 'right' and a 'far right' from which they framed a 'right' and a 'far right'. Later they actually pushed out a clean and clean character is on the one hand, and the situation needs to be more about social instigation. It is not necessarily an important original commission when it instigates and allows its fire to join the party, and then to do so and entrusted it with a heavy duty. What is often said that 'there is good, the next must be absent', and why is it not the so-called revolutionary wind that is domesticated by the wind and the wind? \\nThe experience after the death of the 'right'\\nNan Youqu Yucan was designated as 'extreme right'. It was his own deportation of thousands of 'right-wing' re-education centres in Shandong for three years. He recently listened to him that his labor tasks were mainly transporting dead bodies from within and out of the re-education facility, almost every day, sometimes several times a day. And as a general 'right', I was allocated to the countryside first and moved to the county farm for reforming labor for three years. After three years of unspeakable labor transformation, after re-assigning teaching assignments, he always felt framed and was a child, and his heart was unbalanced, so I wrote a letter to Mao Zedong. Confidence was sent quietly registered, and soon a receipt from the General Office of the CPC Central Committee was sent to the school. Since I was in class, many people in the school office watched it. Having this receipt sparked the surprise of the leaders and colleagues and asking themselves inevitably. Not to mention that there was a large number of right-tipping cases in the country, and there were Taiwanese aircraft spotting leaflets, saying Chiang Kai-shek wants to counter the mainland. So deeply felt that the problem was serious, and once the letter returned to the ground, the consequences would be unimaginable. After repeated reflection, decided to leave and hastily marry with his lover Ma Yuxiu to create Kanto. However, it is still not out of the 'man-made' years of desolation. Because of the black pot, workers do not dare to be, rural areas do not take care, but have to turn places to beg along the street. During this period was caught as a 'blind flow' into the shelter station, minus forty degrees stayed to see the wild boar pony rack; rainstorm destroyed hundreds of meters of bridge, had to climb its suspended track on the waves and in search of dinner for his village's wife. After two years of begging, some people said, since they were born in the family of traditional Chinese medicine, have studied medicine since early childhood, why not go to the hospital as a doctor. So I went to the commune medical word with courage. The Korean people in the hospital, listened to me about the situation. After consulting with the director, Han doctor Huang decided to issue a try. Several questions came out of 'typhoid fever' and 'inner scripture', so I also answered them in words. So in words, it is that the Korean people are not speaking well in Chinese, and the language is about not very hard, because of course I am not without speculation, but I am helpless, always better than begging. Fortunately, the question is what I am familiar with, it was quite smooth. The hospital decided to try for half a month after looking at the volume. During this period, there was a patient suffering from 'diaphragm' and many poorly treated patients came to the hospital. Dean naturally handed over to me for treatment with Chinese medicine. I take the secret recipe, according to the illness, men and women, seasons and physical condition slightly, after three payment of medicine will get more. So a gun hit, and fame. Of course, I have to be very careful with this, and there is no reason to face the sick. \\nUntil the Cultural Revolution, at the beginning of the Kanto Mountains there was a small movement in the big movement, called 'two deep digging' of deep digging of traitor agents. Three control naturally includes all the so-called class enemies, so there can be no help, only to report the 'right' matter to their home. Since then, it is bound to be a class enemy of the Ming card to fight for 10 years. The tragic tragedy of a decade is self-evident. On December 19, 2000, I wrote a short article, 'Past things that should not be mentioned again'. I may wish to move here as an example to read what decade I've been through-\\nIt was the winter of 1,967 years. \\nAs a salvation of death and injury treatment, and salvage is the enemy of the Ming class of me, destiny is from where to go to where it is inevitable. So no matter when the heads have orders, they hurry to order a hospital visit. This day went to a small mountain village 30 miles away from the hospital. The patient was a seventeen year old girl named Zheng Xiaoling, who took dozens of sleeping pills with the production captain. To trek thirty miles, Zheng Xiaoling is already in danger, teeth bite, mouth spit viscous foam, cold limbs. I really didn't want or dare to intervene alone in treating it. Right wing identity, class enemy, so patient, cure or cure, in case of death, in that era, I could not have to eat and walk away. However, according to medical ethics, in the case of not getting to the hospital, we can't see death or save. Weighing it again and again, the village officer and his patient parents had hasty consultations. The conclusion was that the disease was cured and could not be treated. As long as I tried to do my best, I would be a good doctor. \\nSo first hang the first aid hanging needle, and then let people help to open the teeth, mouth-to-mouth to suck its sputum, and then irrigation boiling water, breeding, repeatedly several times. In the absence of sputum with gastric lavage, it can only be so. Then, let her mother help with a catheterization. It's a doctor, the routine of treating patients in that kind of environment. However, after the patient got out of insurance, after recovering, it was impossible to think of this catheterization and sputum rings but had so far thought of all the unbelievable tragedy. \\nThat's back to the hospital. That was the big print posted by the Red Guards in the hospital under the title 'insulting the poor farmers'. The big print is doing its best to reverse black and white, depicting it itself difficult to speak, but it drafts this hard to spill over the doctor's head. So criticized, so confined, so the little morgue became my prison. As people who have done their best to rescue patients without reason, at this time, in the face of this kind of world, do not think of death what else can I think of? When did the sky open up the eyes of Chamin's life? Who in the world will behave his heart? For the sick population, why would it pay for indecent assault? Catheter detox first aid patients, how can kindness? \\n'Think well? Not all of these, I don't want to pass through!' \\nThis is the fifth day of questioning. For five days, the General Assembly has criticized, this obscene, obscenity, of course, is the fuse. Along this fuse once detonated, is the Red Guards crazy bounded cries, laughter and fist flying, stick up and down. When the struggle was fierce, someone actually drank me out of a cotton coat in the winter, and let the revolutionary masses see exactly what color the heart and liver of the sexusts are. So immediately someone unclothed the hat, more people shouted to let it show itself. Helpless, but only immediately take off only the waistband. Sadness is that until I fell into the ground, until after repeated and repeated hundreds of people, there was no one who spits half a word of wrongs, or did not dare to say, saying that it will be with the same sin. This is how the times are proclaiming only the truth is the right upside down. In front of this truth, that is to say, from the right to this point, the class enemy of the Republic as a Ming brand, can be said that I have experienced a hundred wars, and know that 'cure and save people' translates into 'tempting you to hook up' and 'conspiracy' has evolved into 'bright and upright', once hooked up and pleaded guilty, that is A real dead end! So it has not been easy, even though this morgue borrowed as a prisoner, is closest to death, but death is also a ghost of innocence. \\nIt was a small iron window in the morgue, and looked at his feet, his wife holding a child around the bed quilt in the hospital and wandered away, desperate helpless was expelled from the hospital. It was before leaving, facing the iron window looking back at a glance of the grievances helpless, saved the soul I wanted to go, and lived through a long night. The next day was unconscious, he looked at her feet again. The wife was about refused to see, but what she could not see was Zheng Xiaoling's mother and daughter who had already recovered. They were in the snow in the hospital, together to face this small window tears. Wait until the Red Guard President came, the little woman listened to his mother shouting his dean, actually dumped her mother's arch and put the small head of the red guard who thought he was the old man, arch a dog to grab the shit. Not waiting for the guy to climb up, the mother and daughter tear off his cotton coat, and then want to tear, the guy fled. Thereafter it was the mother and daughter snuggled in the snow until it was dark, saying that they sat down in the hospital of the people without letting them both their mothers and daughters. On this day, the little woman has an outrage, still lingering in my ear. That is after she saw the Red Guard President fled, stomping her feet and bouncing her fingers and shouting out:\\n'You bereaved dogs, some kind of open the iron door, just open me and go to sleep with the doctor, see if you can reproduce your dog bastards!' \\nAfter all, the conscience of heaven and earth was not extinct, and I finally put the word 'death' aside. Until her mother and daughter did not return on hunger strike, the Yan Luo Temple of life only slightly opened the door, so that a sinner who was a good anti-crime crime once again stepped out of the death valley. However, the poetry of God is not dead, even if such a person is difficult, there is still poetic poetry to come to a small morgue, so far the memory is fresh:\\nHow good would it be if it was a flood\\nThere's nothing in chaos.\\nIt is rare to have a bowl of Meng Po soup\\nIt is not cruel to say that the sky is not cruel\\nThis concludes the text. The following is to say this life perseverance about literature-\\nI did not have the opportunity to enter higher education. In the book 'Social Humanities and Literature', I have two separate paragraphs: 'As for me, there is nothing more than a misguided, history, child, concentrated small bookfish in the years of terror, and was inadvertently entered since childhood, even after decades of rebirth, could not get out of birth. Bone falls in love with the mistakes of Chinese culture, or mistaken in the opposite direction Hen. As far as Huaxia is concerned, if it is more mistaken or misconceived, it will know more about the 'nine floors, from the earth', less into the magic some benevolent wisdom, why not 'the old and the old and the old, young and young people, the world can be transported in the palm of the palm'? Nationalities are living in the country, guojiang mountains stand high in Guohua, heaven humanities will advocate 'everyone holds the orb of spirits, home called jade of jade of jade of jingshan'. So as of this year, it is more 'chapter excerpt old carved worms, Aria when the curtain hang jade bow', thought that the only way back to recognize the Chinese humanistic renaissance, proclaimed the humanistic culture of the unique, only to be able to 'heavenly human development, Wanhua tiding'. Therefore, I said repeatedly that the humanistic integrity of the Chinese nation will survive forever with the Chinese nation. Song Ru Zhang Zai said, it should be the voice of people with knowledge since ancient times: 'Stand heart for the heavens and the earth, for life and life, for the end of the school, and the peace for the world. ' \\n'I have a lot of hobbies in my life, music, sports, painting, calligraphy, Chinese medicine, reading, literary writing, and all interested in childhood. This is where reading, writing is the top priority, can be said to be accompanied by always. Writing is triggered by reading, reading by the teacher by the beginning of the scripture, history, sub-set and then, then into the present there are 'Three Five Arts', 'Journey to the West', 'Water Margin', 'Three Kingdoms', 'Dream of the Red House', 'Talking', 'Ancient Wonders' and other pure literature. Ren Ching-lun, the elder brother Ren Chi-him, the enlightenment division of the near door, often gathered in the light of these books or in the corner. I sometimes get lively, but more is borrowed self-reading. As children are still children, reading these books like scriptures, history, subsets, not necessarily swallowed alive, words exile stories can be understood and satisfied, and even become peers little angels, each statement will make them blooming. Then it was admitted to the teacher training school, in the fact that reading was really like a fish. Learning is that I am second, previewing the classroom in advance, and more time is reading amateur books, sometimes reading forty or fifty long novels and biographies. Teacher Fan Xuexuan who manages books or favors or sincerely supports, especially for the introduction of masterpieces and speaks about the essentials of reading. At this time, the subjects of Lu Xun, Bajin, Mao Dun, Yu Dafu, Shen Congwen, Guo Moruo, Bai Mang, Ai Qing, Zhang Henshui, and then anti-Japanese, land reform novels, Soviet novels. The overall feeling at this time is no more than two aspects, one is that modern contemporary is not as horizontal as classical, interesting; the second is the modern contemporary including the Soviet literature, is increasingly feeling the same idea, writing and discipline. After leaving the school to embark on teaching career, save food and frugal money to buy books. At that time there was an agreement with the old bookstore in Beijing, as long as the money left, even two yuan to be sent there, choose the purchaser from the regularly provided book list, the letter will be sent. So there exists and then reread all hundred homes, classical poetry, four talents, literature history biography, Yi Li paintings. Every bookstore believers still buy Pushkin, Lermontov, Heyne, Goethe, Dante, Shelley, Byron, Keith, Homer, Whitman, Shakespeare, Mrs. Belonin, Balzac, Big and Size Zhongma, Belinsky, Gogol, Old Tolstoy, and so on. This period not only knew more about literary world literature, but also the authenticity or superiority of literature, there was a further comparison, cognition and understanding. The fourth stage of study was the period of re-employment after the birth of the right. With you all the hundreds of families, literary famous characters in addition, fortunately is both farm and agricultural school labor place, there is a lot of books stacked in the corner of the warehouse. Liu Boxun, who worked with labor reform, was also the leader of dozens of labor reform 'right-wing' groups, and had a key hand to enter the warehouse at any time. So the two people consulted, he read logic, I read philosophy, read the two people exchange, in order to save time and two. But for a short time, the soldier 'right' Liu Boxun drowned, and he was alone. After work, he studied Herakrit, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, Marx, Lenin, and the self-acquired Institute of Philosophy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences 'Principles of Marxism Philosophy' and so on. And from the above books, especially 'Capital Theory', recorded hundreds of pages of abstracts. At that time, he had a whimsical start with Liu Boxun and said that if anyone opened the test for 'Capital Theory', they would not be among the highest scores, and the common insight was that the whole dialysis of 'capital theory' was academic, not just class and class struggles, and not the universal truth. However, no argument has been found in these books as to why it would be a 'right', and therefore disappointment. However, it would be helpful to experience the life of society later. If Liu Jun was alive, it would certainly be said so, saying that this extremely tired, hungry, and miserable 'reforming colleges' is worth it. But he died, many years ago, and died so desolate, helpless and sorrow!' \\nEven if the Cultural Revolution has no other books readable, medical reading is splendid, so 'Huang Di Neijing', 'typhoid', 'medical evidence', 'standard of treatment', and so on, became the relying on the day and evening to be accompanied by passionate affection. And read from the doctor's philosophy, 'inner scripture' such as the words, it became integrated into the past, to be exhaustive, to learn the roots of the world: 'too vicious Liao Kuo, Zhaoji Yuan, all goods start, five luck all day, Qi Zhi Yuan, nine stars hanging, seven sizzy circles'; 'The weather is bright, the human blood and defenses float, so blood easy to write, easy to write; cold and cloudy, human blood clogging and guard Air deposition. The beginning of the month, blood seed, sanitary start; Moon Guo Man, blood, muscle solid; Moon Guo kong, muscle reduction, meridian weakness, defect to, form of living alone, is due to day and time to turn blood also', 'Yin and Yang, the way of heaven and earth, the platform of all things, parents of change, the beginning of life, the House of God also 'No ghosts, alone. The biological called, the extreme change. Yin and Yang is not the god, God with senseless holy. Man is angry with the heavens and the earth, four times. Heaven and earth Aiqi, life is human. The heaven is in my deity, and the earth is also in me, the devil is also born'; 'On the poor days, the lower polar geography, the distant, take things near the body, more difficult to ask, the law to bless the world.' \\nIn 1957, anti-right to 'Cultural Revolution' countries launched a great counterproductive experience, as a 'right' has 10 years of bitter experience, during which the poetry of 'one enduring ten years of speechless' verses is normal, here began 'underground' poetry more common. Therefore, 'distressed life · wall seam psalm page · upper and lower volume' left. On May 29, 1988, if written in a postscript for these two volumes of poetry, may wish to draw a reading-\\nThis is a poem written in 'underground' during the Cultural Revolution period, which has been tentatively completed. Because amateur finishing, amateur is often difficult to have amateur, original and mildew insect insect is difficult to identify, so intermittently finishing 1967. Of course, in 1967 there are new ink, forget to look at the weather, and have to prevent the cold glimpse or insane around the villain. Therefore, my family, Wang Qing'an, his best friend, is alone, and no one knows that I am dazzling for the poems long night and bloodshed. Because it is finishing, because to preserve the original appearance, have to face mildew moth broken paper, bark, wood leaves repeatedly speculated, unearthed relics like repair broken, seeking the original intention. Finishing later, facing most of the sack is difficult to tell and really undiscern the heart and sorrow, have to pay torch, arch the West day, a farewell. So sad and hidden, lies in the hard writing at that time, mostly in misery, the manuscript after the manuscript forgot to forget the manuscript again; more love wife collection, after the collection is afraid of flashy have to worry; who knows once fell to the ubiquitous revolutionaries, what kind of wildfire will have to burn body! Later, Qing'an learned to pay a torch, and said that if it could be preserved, it would be a Heisei relic. \\nThere are three principles when finishing, one of the forms unchanged; the content of the second is unchanged; and the three can be concatenated only in series. There are also three points: because it is written in the 'underground', immaculate propositions and withdrawals, finishing the natural, only to digitally, not for the first time; second, after writing a hurry collection, it has been disordered, the finishing has taken into account but can not be implemented; the third is related to the two chief poems, although not at all, but Because it is written on a piece of wrapping kraft paper, the look is complete. \\nDespite the abandonment of more than half, after all, more than 860 very poems of the very years were sorted out, and a few remnants were retained. When writing a few words for this, Ma Yingshi, his wife, without her, there will never be the birth and preservation of these poems. It was around 1967 New Year's Day and around New Year's Day. It was slightly quiet, sitting with him in Kang Tau during the long night sleepless, and quietly recite a small poem from the abdomen, and then wrote it to her to see. This poem has not been repaired, and the remaining two sentences in the remnants are farther visible:\\nSurvival and death are not distant\\nDistant is silent after death\\nSo talking about more and more dead, less dead. Such a situation, do not leave a little innocence to the child, let their white and black words clear; otherwise, it will be years of blank feelings more blank. Certainly turquoise is difficult, afraid of evil because of poetry, fear of saving inadvertently evil from heaven, not as hard as it is to listen to the fate of heaven, follow the situation Until I spoke repeatedly, and recite Wen Tianxiang 'Crossing Zero-Ding Yang', she finally cry tears and acquiescence, let me express my feelings in order to leave behind the pen. After that, we had to discuss how to destroy the collection and how to deal with the scourge. So, as a poet, I have the world in distress; as a wife, she took on the burden of collection. So a psalm, so accumulate, secretly stored in the wall seams, turning to the present day. \\nThis is the 'Distressed Life, Wall Slit Psalm'. Once published, the title of the book 'I am dedicated to the life and death of the love wife Ma Yingshi' on its title page, self-proclaimed righteousness. To say this is the life of the pastus, if no love wife flukstone accompanied by life and death, not only without this poem survived, even this person, will have long been dead! \\nIf you say a few more words after the 'postscript', there is nothing more than following the correction of the 'right-wing' farewell to the return of Kantoyama to his After returning, of course, you can get medical attention, because I try to choose more free time work, so go to secondary school as a medical doctor. However, owing to the shortage of teachers, medical doctors had to go outside the lecture hall, so physicians were qualified and promoted to senior secondary teachers. Laozi said, 'Knowing that he has kept his shame, is the valley of the world,' and 'the evil of all people, so it is almost a word', is the motto of my life. So I often say to my children and my students that I have lived two lives in my life, because I never slept before midnight until 12 o'clock at midnight, and the play field never participated. Such a bookfish, it is no longer strange that literary works are published at the age of 13. Only less than sixty thousand words of a long novel, 'Bright Avenue' and some poems, which were completed under 17 years old, a person who died right after Yan said that his superiors had instructions to be settled. After learning that it was his personal work, after correction of the 'right' he died of serious illness and then died, found no whereabouts, so far there was no word. His novel is absolutely immature to write, but its story is still fresh in memory: Sun Ruolan, an orphan and a child daughter-in-law, is about to flee his house when she is about to complete marriage, because he has no way to pass by cattle economy Wang Dakui adopted. Wang Dakui was a member of the underground Communist Party. He was absent from home throughout the day, so he was robbed home by his father, Mr. Wu Erjian. Mr. Wu Errefers slightly to the text, and there are no children under his knees, so to adopt Sun Ruolan, is still ready to borr"},

In addition to hereditary tutor, read ancient and modern Chinese medicine, carefully discussed and researched theoretical medicine, more than 40 years of practice in medicine, law-abiding but not mud, according to the party but distilled, often seeking to be practiced in the exercise, so many discoveries, innovation and creativity, and every different work wonders, loved by patients Fame. In order to serve the community with the secret medicine, it is hoped to develop business investment cooperation, to benefit the sick and prolonging life, manufacturers economic benefits are impressive. Introducing three kinds of special effects medicine are as follows:\\nFirst, flat stomach growth Bhutan: internal medicine, a taste of Chinese medicine 'Bei Yi grass' made. 'Bei Yi Grass', not documented in ancient and present Chinese medicine, is found and named for the individual mountain forest. Its medicine is tried by individuals first taste, temperature, taste, non-toxic, each serving one to three grams, that has a strong gastrointestinal analgesic function. Healing stomach since ancient times to na, transport, pass as the criteria, that gastric, spleen transport to pass down, pass down the pain, so take its gastric diet proves good effect. The author has more than 40 years of practical proof, with its single-taste pharmaceutical Dan application: Where liver and stomach discord, spleen loss caused by spleen loss caused by full, er inverse, gas, dry, pain, dainty, no matter the cold fever, the new disease, have excellent therapeutic effect, and can medicine to stop, can treat the stomach the best good medicine. Patients with oral administration for five to seven days, not only symptom loss or disappearance, and multiplication of appetite, stomach spleen transport is preferable. Therefore, it has effective or adjuvant therapy for acute and chronic gastritis, gastrointestinal gatta, and patients with spleen gastric naplasia, etc. Based on this medicine, slightly match, can still modulate a series of gastric cure recipe. Song Ren Li Dongyuan said in 'Spleen Gastric Theory': 'The source of the twelve traps of the stomach, the sea of water and the sea of water, and the disease is dangerous.' Stomach health is the base of longevity, so the name 'flat stomach long old Dan'. \\nSecond, the etheria god effective Dan: external medicine, personal originality. This mouthpiece, mouth mouth, mouthpiece, white mouth, that is, Western medicine said oral stiffness, regardless of men, women and children, have special effects. Not only can medicine to pain relief, three packs a day, two to three days can be healed. And its medicine for oral keratitis, pharyngitis, hybritis, tonsillitis have excellent efficacy. With a slight adaptation, a range of other effective topical drugs can be produced. It is named for the treatment of oral disease.

On 13 December 1991, the disease died in Yangzhou, aged 95. \\nRen zhongmin has been engaged in educational and academic research throughout his life and has written more than 5 million words. Its academic achievements are mainly in the research of songwriter and Tang Dynasty music, and the music clues of Hanlefu, Dunhuang lyrics, acoustic poems, words, and scattered music. The main authors include 'Dunhuang Song Preliminary Study', 'Dunhuang Songs', 'Tang Teasing', 'Teacher Notes Book', 'Episode of Tang Sing Poem', 'Guo Huang Lyrics Editor', 'Sui Tang Tang Dynasty Yan Le Analogy Collection', among which, 'Tang Teasing' won the 'First National Drama Theory Award'.

It is the first batch of doctoral mentors approved by the State Council. \\nRen zhongmin Academic Contribution\\nThe main career of Ren zhongmin in his life is to study ancient songs and Dunhuang testimonies. From the 1920s, he published dozens of more than five million words under the pseudonym of 'Two North', 'Sweetheart Series' and so on, thus establishing the position of a master of songwriter. 'Two North', take the Northern Song word and the righteousness of Beiqu. From the 1940s, he traveled from North Song, thus opening up a new field of Tang Dynasty vocal and literary research. \\nScripture Research\\nRen zhongmin's early teacher from the famous opera scholar Wu Mei, dedicated to the study of North Song lyrics and Jin Yuansanqu and its musical theory. He has written 'Ten Law Lexteration', 'Introduction to Sadom', 'Song Xie', and other series of composers of Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasty satist composers set more than 30 kinds, compiled the theoretical series 'New Qu Yuan'. In 'Xinqu Yuan', the main information on the scattered songs, theories, Qu rhymes, and compositions have contributed to the collection and research of classical drama history materials and theoretical works. \\nMr. Ren's main achievement in Xiqu is his research on the origins of Xiqu. His masterpiece, 'Tang Teasing' \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), is a work devoted to the evolution of Tang drama from Tang to five generations following the history of Song Yuan opera by Wang Guowei. In addition to providing an overview of the history of Xiqu development, the book also discusses the initial form of Tang Dynasty's coarse opera performing arts, and retrieves and examines the features of Tang Theatre's script, stage, music, makeup, costumes, props and other aspects. Thus, 'the drama of the story in China, Gu started early in Han, and Sheng Yu Tang', and Zhou has a 'play ceremony', Han Sui has 'play elephant', Tang has 'teasing', and since Song has 'opera' proposition, opposes cutting the chengkai link between the Song Yuan Theatre and Tang Drama. His writings also include 'Ancient Opera Hengyuan' 'The source of puppet puppet prospecting' and other special papers, and the collection of excellent words of haiyou artisans since West Week. \\nAfter the establishment of New China, Ren zhongmin was appointed as a professor of the Department of Chinese Language at Sichuan University. At this time he was brewing a leap in his academic life, identifying a new academic project: Tang Yi Research. Today's academic community is called Tang Yixue. This is a new discipline created by Ren zhongmin. 'Tang Art' here refers specifically to 'art' linked to literature, especially music and literary arts. The subjects of study include the 'teasing' of the Tang Dynasty (Tang Dynasty drama), 'acoustic poetry' (synoptic poetry with singing), 'analogy lyrics' (folk and literary expressions drawn from folk forms of 'long and short phrases'), 'big songs' (larger songs and dancers with them), 'rhetoric'' (song, dance and lyrics in the wine feast), 'rap' (speaking and singing in combination to tell stories), etc. Connecting to his early academic research, we can find that he has gained a new understanding of traditional propositions, such as the origin of words, the occurrence of ancient drama, the development of paragraph patterns, and so on; and its deep meaning is to show the function and value of literature in social activities, breaking the academic world A long history of a single writer literature and literalism research tendencies, thus contributing to a comprehensive approach to 'ancient literature' And vivid examination and understanding. \\nSince the 1950s, Mr. Ren zhongmin has conducted pioneering research on Tang Dynasty music and art. His 'Teaching Notes Book' was formed in 1952, later improved, published by the Chinese Book Bureau in July 1962. The first book, 'Tang Dynasty Music and Literature Research Fafan', opened the door to study Tang Dynasty music and literature. He pointed out: 'Tang Dynasty music is quite splendid, shisha gei persheng, where the combination of musical words and craps, hereby referred to as musical literature and art, is set as the subject of this study.' Nearly 900,000 words of Tang Sing Poems published by Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House in 1982 can be regarded as a representative of Ren zhongmin Tang's musical and literary research, and an important landmark achievement in the 20th century Tang Poetry study. A comprehensive research method that traces the source flow, discerns the style, and builds theories, and explores the facts of Tang Dynasty poetry and Chinese poetry. It has long been unremarked in the study of Tang Poetry, enriching people's understanding of Tang Poetry art, making the causes of many characteristics more relevant to Tang Poetry Reasonable explanations and open ideas for later study of 'acoustic poetry'. Ren zhongmin studied the relationship between acoustic poetry and Yanle, Qingle and Hu Le in the nature of music, and the relationship with dance, big song, mixed song, and noisy on the basis of the pattern. On this basis, he analyzed the relationship between acoustic poetry and long and short phrases. There are effects, but by no means, as a number of scholars say the anecdotal body is transformed from congruent sports, the two bodies are 'brotherhood' rather than 'paternity,' which is a significant backdialing for the origins of the past words. \\n'Tang Sing Poem' is extremely rich in the search of related materials. First, the collection of the Tang Dynasty does exist, or may exist tune names; second, from Tang Dynasty literary poetry collection and folk lyrics collected a large number of words that have indeed sang, or have singing possible; third is to collect a large number of relevant records, and synthesize various views for Tang Dynasty literature and art Researchers provide great convenience. \\nDunhuang Studies\\nMr. Ren has a deep and unique research on Dunhuangxue. Ren zhongmin studied Dunhuang's book for more than 20 years, and published 'Dunhuang Song Preliminary Study' and 'Dunhuang Song Recordings'. In his masterpiece 'Dunhuang Lyrics Editor', he produced a detailed chronology for the study of Dunhuang song lyrics, and according to the genre of miscellaneous songs, singles, joint chapters, large songs and other genres, included more than 1,500 Dunhuang lyrics, while all the lyrics have been rigorously revised, discerned, restored, analyzed. Comparisons and studies. is a new insight into the study of Song and Jin Yuan Scatter. The finishing of the song lyrics in Dunhuang's book, only Luo Zhenyu 'Dunhuang Zero Pick' collection of the first half of the collection of 'Yunyao Collection' and Zhu Xiaozang 'Qumcun series' after 18 of the English collection, plus sporadic analogy, the total number is not satisfied with a hundred. In the forties, Wang Zhongmin 'Dunhuang Songs Phrases' came out, more than 160. In the 50s, due to the growing range of international exchanges in China, scholars vision open, to Ren zhongmin's 'Dunhuang Song Recordings', has received more than 540 songs and big song. In the 1960s, the Hong Kong scholar Jao Tsung-I and the French scholar Paul Daimiwei co-authored the book 'Dunhuang Song' with 318 entries. In the early 1970s, Ren zhongmin began to compile the 'Dunhuang lyrics editor', only in 1984, published in 1987 by Shanghai Ancient Book Publishing House, expanded the lyrics in Dunhuang written volumes to more than 1,500. The book has both a summary nature and an editor-editor nature, the song lyrics and examination, and the discussion in one part, reflects Dunhuang Learning The latest results of the research paved the way for the history and selection of two Dunhuang studies. \\nIn his early years, he believed in Sun Yat-sen's three nationalism and served as secretary of Hu Hanmin. After being confined by Chiang Kai-shek, Hu was transformed into an education job and founded Hanmin High School in Nanjing. \\nAt the end of November 1937, when the Japanese army deputy near Nanjing, Hanzhong moved to Guilin, located in the east of the mountain, covering nearly 100 acres. He is very strict, and the teachers hired require real talents, many of whom are well-known scholars and professors. Students are in school and board, live a group life, pay attention to school style and discipline, work two hours a week, and those who do not pass sports are not allowed to upgrade. Hanzhong teaching quality, reputation, university admission rate is extremely high, enjoys a reputation in the big southwest. Ren zhongmin run the school features, and there are many anecdotes circulating the population. His only son was also reading in Chinese, and he forced him to dismiss him because he was noisy and violated school rules in the classroom. The lady was sad and forced him to go to the city to find a school transfer. As a result, he personally picked his luggage and sent his son to school in the city, and he was told to laugh. He is also very strict about the general affairs work of the school. The subtle stubs are also written on paper. On one occasion, he asked all school teachers, but he had no chopsticks. Someone asked what was going on, the director of general affairs said that chopsticks were not written on the principal's list. Everybody laughed, but he said rightly that I had written out, and the responsibility was not with Director Zhao. During the anti-Japanese war, Guilin education circles had spread the so-called 'eight strange'. Ren zhongmin was 'a strange', as well as Wuxi Guozhong Professor Liang Shuming, Liangjiang Normal Principal Tang Xianzhi, Dean of Jiangsu Institute of Education Gao Yang and so on. The so-called 'strange' people are different. \\nRen zhongmin exuberated\\nRen zhongmin's academic achievements have been achieved in extremely difficult circumstances. It has never been understood that a giant book painstakingly published, was called 'Knocking Gong Sell Sugar (Don)' business. \\nRemarks on Ren zhongmin 'Three hundred Yuan Song'\\nFor almost 30 years before 1980, he had hardly ever been to the rostrum for political reasons; lived in a shady room in Jiaojia Lane, Pihuan Village or Shuijing Street, Chengdu; read to the library during the day with a backbasket with thermos bottles and old calendar sheets, finishing the transcribed materials in the evening, in the morning Time to write. In China's academic history, it was a period of relative depression, but the strong character of Ren zhongmin made it a golden period in his academic career. In 1955, before undergoing the quarantine examination of the anti-anti-movement, Ren zhongmin completed and published two books, 'Dunhuang Song Recordings' and 'Dunhuang Song Preliminary Studies'. Prior to 1962, Ren zhongmin, in his capacity as the right and historical counter-revolution, wrote four books such as 'Tang Teasing', 'Classroom Notes', 'Tang Sing Poem' and 'A Book of Good Words', and published the first two books. The Cultural Revolution destroyed all his manuscripts, including the multimillion-word 'Tang Song Yan Le Integration'; however, he used the aftermath of his labor reform to produce 'Dunhuang Song Editor'. The book later accompanied him on two long distances: in 1978, while residing as a part-time researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Beijing, he revised and supplemented the book with microfilm from the Beijing Library. After returning to his hometown as a professor at Yangzhou College in 1980, he added, and at the age of 90 he saw the advent of this giant as a summary of all over the academic. The above seven works, more than 3 million words, with the three feet of song art, drama, music, support a system of Tang Dynasty literature and art. \\nIn 1981, Ren zhongmin, who is 85 years old, was declared by Yangzhou Teachers Institute to state master teacher qualification, and was approved by the State Council as the first doctoral mentor, this is the difference. He has coached three PhD students, two of whom have now succeeded in their career as PhD mentors at the PhD sites they have studied. \\nWang Guowei's Song Yuan-Xiqu Kao thinks that Song previously 'does not have a real form of drama'. Ren zhongmin first raised doubts about this. As a combination of vocal literature and art, theatrical literature and art are not recorded or recorded in ancient times, and orthodox literary historians disregard. Its texts are mostly found in folk classrooms and grottoes, which are difficult to see. Mr. Ren stormed the rain, visited Xianyu, searched tens of millions of words of raw materials. And then climb the rocks, match the gap, form their own independent and systematic insights. \\nIn 1951, Ren zhongmin, 54 years old, was introduced by the United Front Department of the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee to get rid of his career as a stall selling beans, and taught at Sichuan University. He set up an ambitious plan to write eight works of Tang Yifa Wei, each of which is about 1 million words, and seeks publishing by the press. He said he never sold spiced beans, instead of selling sugar (Tang), knocking gong sold sugar. \\nOn June 11, 1955, Mr. Ren's 58th birthday 'Teasing Tang' put a pen on his 58th birthday. 'Tang Teasing' is the first part of his plan 'Tang Yifa Wei', which counts 900,000 words, and discusses Tang Xizhisheng in a lot of historical materials. From the repertoire, song words, props, programs and other aspects, he divided Tang drama into eight categories: 1. acoustic poetry; 2. Long and short sentences; 3. large song; 4. Variant text; 5. Teasing; 6. wine order; 7. yalle lyrics; 8. song lyrics. The publication of this book will open the door to the Tang Dynasty Vocal Arts Garden. \\nUnfortunately, in 1957 Mr. Ren was mistakenly beaten as the right. The first 'sugar pill' was not sold, he faced the risk of closing the door, the writer's publishing house has a unique eye, still willing to risk out this book, and then consult with Mr., change the name. Mr. Ren said, 'It's good to do, as long as the book can come out, whatever you call. I dare not to compare with him. I talk about Tang play, only talk about drama, not about platoon, 100 plays, just a 'half-sided', half a Tang, it's called 'half Tang.' Publishing house in typography, 'Tang' before adding a soil beside, into a 'half pond'. Ren old proposed to go to the soil, but it is not time to change. Since then, the name 'half pond' rang the classical literature research community. \\nIn 1962, Mr. Ren's Book Book of Classroom Notes was published by the Chinese Book Bureau. In 1980, his students Hu Qiaomu and Jiang Nanxiang discussed with relevant parties and moved to Yangzhou Normal University. 1981 was approved by the State Council as the first doctoral mentor. In the same year, the collection of excellent words was published by Shanghai Literary and Art Publishing House. In 1984, Tang Sing Poems was published by Shanghai Ancient Book Publishing House. In 1987, 'Dunhuang Lyrics Editor' was published by Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House. Academic circles at home and abroad have agreed that the 1.2 million words of Dunhuang Song Editor is a declaration of Dunhuang's return to China (Japanese once said: Dunhuang in China and Dunhuang learn in Japan). \\nRen Old has worked for more than 70 years. When the 'Dunhuang Song Editor' was published, he cooperated with student Wang Xiaodun's 'Sui Tang Five Dynasty Yan Le Lyric Collection' and 'Tang's Word', which he collaborated with Assistant Child Jian, were also included in the publication plan. Thus, the plan of 'Tang Yifa Wei' eight major parts is basically completed. In June 1987, the same man celebrated his 90th birthday, when he replied, laughed about decades of hard selling sugar. Professor Tan Fochu wrote on the signature book: Bashuviyang, 90 star cream; half-life career, knocking on gong selling sugar. \\nWorks by Ren zhongmin\\nMr. Ren's main writings: 'New Qu Yuan' \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), 15 kinds of 'Scatter Series' \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), Song Tongyi \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), 'Dunhuang Song' \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), Dunhuang Song Recordings \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), Tang Teasing \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), Episodes of Good Words \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), Tang Sing Poems \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), Dunhuang Lyrics Editor in Chief \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), Sui Tang Dynasty Yan Le Analogy Lyric Collection \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), etc. \\nRen zhongmin 'Scattered Song Series'\\nRen zhongmin 'Scattered Song Series'\\nScatter Series\\nScatter total set.

The book selects psalms and their tunes from the vast ocean of Tang Dynasty poetry that have sang or have traces of singing. The selection criteria are based on sound, depending on their vocal music. Ren zhongmin on the 'sound' of the poetry, not flat into the sound of four voices, but the true sound of music, although four voices can be attributed to the poetry purity of the harmonious and beneficial to sing, but can not rely on the panning of poetry, Ye Yun and refer directly to the poetry, only if you can sing, is the main basis for judging the poetry 'Tang Sing Poems' specifically lists one hundred and fifty six notes, from 'founding', 'solution', 'alias', 'pitch', 'tuning', 'law to', 'word', 'song', 'dance' and so on, its meticulous degree is not in the past in the study of music and style.

This has become one of the important elements of the attack on the party by right-wing elements and misconceptions. The fact is that Rong mengyuan conducted anti-party sectarian activities with our assistant researcher XX before 1953, causing a very bad impact both inside and outside the premises. At that time, Rong mengyuan and other people who attacked party members and progress outside the party, the political ideological leadership of the opposition party, held the editorial board and other institutions inside the house, crowded out the leadership of the Party's research work, and attempted to replace the Party's leadership with bourgeois academic thought. \\nAt the end of 1953, Rong mengyuan and other words were seriously criticized. It seems that this criticism is still correct and absolutely necessary. Rong mengyuan seized the opportunity of the whole wind to launch a counter-attack against the party, reversing the case all. He spread the fallacy at and outside the colloquium, saying: 'Small circles (by referring to the small opposition sects), do not exist at all, are artificial, made by x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x.  The anti-small circle movement 'is based on facts, some are misunderstandings, some are framed by conspiracy'. \\nHe distorted the facts and said that in 1953 he criticized him, pointing out that he was opposed to the party because of contradictions between him and the members of the party . Or say: 'Some people say I anti-party, the evidence is that theoretical study did not first consult with x x x x (by: x x x is an interns led by Rong)... party members are also party, × × representative party, everything should listen to × × ×, if not listen is an opposition party.' Words like that are endless. Rong mengyuan fabricated the facts in this way, confused hearing and hearing, provoked serious suspicion and dissatisfaction of some of the masses about the organization of the Party, which at one time caused confusion in mind, and wicked the wind and wicked up. He described the history of the three Party branches as a darkness, and totally negated the party's political ideological work, saying that it was all wrong. Rejecting the Party's leadership in academic work, saying that the Institute has not made achievements and so on. In short, everything in three is bad. \\nSecond, by posting large print newspapers, blows people who have made positive opinions, falsely accusing the three historical parties of refusing to put it and 'close the door' to the whole wind. The firm appeared large print soon, crooked wind began to outcrop. One youth team member posted a large print titled 'Two Points of Hope', stating: 'In order to help the party rectify, shortcomings should be emphasized, but they cannot be completely negated. Past malpractices or human mistakes should be tracked and corrected, but must start from the front, see the positive and the opposite side, otherwise a one-sided evaluation of the entire movement or work will be made.' \\nRong mengyuan saw the big thunder, immediately posted an article entitled 'Closing too early!' The big print newspaper, the author of 'two points of hope' seriously questioned, refuted, and thought that the party branch 'closed doors'. The full text of the large print written by Rong is: 'Speak to be comprehensive, but one knows it is this side, what should I do? Say no? Not comprehensive, do not say! Do not stress the disadvantages. But in fact there are drawbacks, what to do? Say no? Say it is to emphasize the shortcomings, do not say! Don't sign, sir, you think comrades are talking one-sided, emphasizing the shortcomings. You should advise on specific facts. This is nothing to say empty words. The wall just came out of a day, actually going to close the door, too early.' After posting this reactionary big print, Rong mengyuan also said with excitement, 'I am still kind to do this'! \\nRong mengyuan came up and grabbed one on the key issue. It was to prevent anti-party rhetoric from being curbed. After suppressing the positive opinion in this way, the winds and evil spirits became more rampant under his malicious instigation. The bad elements × × × openly criticized the author of 'Two Points of Hope', saying what 'the situation is serious, the masses are extremely dissatisfied, the impact is extremely bad, hindered the whole wind and shine', even forced the author to tear off the big print newspaper, the author does not tear, Huang brutally wants to rush to tear, and several people proposed to write a large print newspaper. apologize to Rong mengyuan The team member finally wrote an article entitled 'Communist Party members should stand firm, adhere to principles, and firmly fight against poisonous grass', and failed to publish because many people oppose blocking. The vicious impact of Rong mengyuan can be fully seen from this matter. \\nThird, to cooperate with people like Zhang Zhenhe, who has already revealed criticism. When Zhang Zhenhe was rampant at the beginning of the wind, many reactionary remarks were dispersed and fired at more than 40 people respectively (about 100 members of the party in the past three participated in the whole wind). Rong mengyuan and Zhang Zhenhe have a very close relationship. At the beginning of the wind, Rong conveyed Chairman Mao's speech from Zhang Xiruo, heard from the CPPCC, to Zhang Zhenhe and stressed issues such as the abolition of the school party committee system, and also declared that the speech of Chairman Mao Liu Dainian conveyed was incompatible with the spirit he knew. The proposal by Zhang Zhenhe to overturn the case for Rong mengyuan's anti-party activities and the total denial of the academic work of the Institute's political ideology work are closely related to the incitement of Rong mengyuan. In addition, under the door of the intern ×, scribe ×, etc., during the whole wind, scattered reactionary remarks and carried out ignition activities. For a period of time, Rong mengyuan actually became the center of the attack on the party by three historically right-wing elements. \\nRong mengyuan: Proposals to Compile Historical Data Since the Revolution in Xinhai\\n[Original: This article was published in the July issue of New Construction. Rong mengyuan openly opposes Marxism's guiding role in historical science, opposes criticism of bourgeois thinking, and advocates the restoration of feudal, capitalist old histories first. In this article, he provokes historians and exposes his anti-socialist personal ambitions.] \\nIn the study of modern history, a period of history after the Xinhai Revolution, the most difficult, pre-revolutionary history, general information has been collated. Although the books such as 'Qing History Draft', 'Review of Literature' and 'Record' are not satisfactory, but in the end, you can check the history of the events An overview of the evolution of the order, chapter system, a simple curriculum vitae and part of the documents. After the Xinhai Revolution there were more information than the Qing Dynasty, but until today it was not done vigorously, which caused great difficulties in the research work. Historical science lies in discovering the laws of historical development, but when the truth about historical events is unclear, it is not possible to discover them. It is not historical science for those who conclude the laws of history without studying material or seriously. Therefore, I think the first step in studying the history of the Revolution should begin by collating historical data since the Revolution. \\nWe have three thousand years of excellent tradition in collating historical data. The genre of China's historical writings is very complex, but they are all based on the facts as orthodox, push the straight straight of Nan Dong, rebuke Wei Shou's filthy history, and the historical facts of various genres repeat each other, but each has its unique role, and one is indispensable. In the course of work, 'Twenty-Four History', 'Nine Pass', 'Nine Dynasty Chronicle Book' 'End' and other history to refer to. The current history since the Xinhai Revolution, in addition to the original materials, is mostly clustered papers. While a paper is necessary, instead of everything, it hinders the research of historical science. (According to: Rong mengyuan here described the 'present' scientific research conducted by the history of our country based on Marxism as the guiding principle, as 'only (the second school is changed to 'more than'), and then said, 'replace everything with papers; that would disrupt the research of historical science.' (This shows that Rong mengyuan believes that using Marxism as a guiding idea would hamper his so-called 'historical science' research.), Taking the study of the Xinhai Revolution as an example, we must first figure out the historical facts and figure out the situation of the intifada in each province and the various individual problems. With this foundation, we can discover the laws. Some say: 'What the Chronicle is the end of the book', 'separate research is bourgeois thought,' this is a mere business view', 'this is out of politics.' I think that this statement is ignorant and is by no means a scientific attitude. (According to: What is called 'Chronicle Originals' and 'separate research is bourgeois thought', etc., are all distorted and fabricated by Rong mengyuan, which are actually used to attack our criticism of the bourgeois academic thinking. In the text, 'I think this statement is very ignorant, never a scientific attitude', in the original is 'I think this statement is very ignorant, but only the diphi, can't dare to say it,' the diphi should kill his head, but no one else knows what it does to me! (This makes it more clear that he is very hateful for the Party's criticism of the bourgeois thought.), The scientific approach of Marxism is to take over material in detail and analyze it in a class perspective. (Press: There is only one reference to Marxism in the whole text, but this is not in the original. This sentence in the original is 'because without a detailed look at historical facts, so called analytical studies cannot be said'. (It was not until late June on the second proof was changed to the present one.), In order to seriously study the history of the Xinhai Revolution, I think we should first inherit the excellent historical traditions of our country and write about various genres. (By: Rong mengyuan, after negating the need for scientific research to be guided by Marxism as the guiding idea, put forward his positive claim: 'First, we should inherit the excellent historical traditions of our country and write the materials of various genres', which is to 'first' restore the feudal, bourgeoisie old History. (This is perfectly consistent with the statement in JLU's Scientific Work Programme that 'first of all changes in attitudes to old social sciences'.), I know that people have collated data from the aftermath of the Xinhai Revolution, because such work was not valued, so that they dropped out of the work, put the materials already collected and made themselves the so-called 'potential' for idle. (By: Rong mengyuan distorted that today's data work is not valued, some people have actually become the 'potential' of inaction. (This is an extremely vicious provocation.), If research history is limited to writing papers, many people are bound to put aside; if you write history books of various genres, edit all kinds of materials, and organize specific questions, then there are many people who can play their power, not only full-time historical workers can play their strength, but also some in various different jobs Those who are interested in history can also play their strength. (Press: Why do many people write 'papers' 'bound to put aside pen', but can 'write history books of various genres'? This further suggests that Rong mengyuan in this article refers to 'papers' or writings that are 'currently' guided by Marxist ideology to 'concatenate', and 'history books of various genres' refer to 'history books' that do not want Marxism or oppose the old history of Marxism. (It also runs through malicious provocations and attempts to restore old history.), As a matter of fact, many historians are not affordable or can not be burdened by historians alone, and can only be done in cooperation between historians and workers in all sectors, even if historians are unable to do so, but rely primarily on professionals in various sectors. In order to build the foundations of a socialist culture and to realize the potential of existing historical work, and in order to make clear the problems and facts of recent history, I feel that, according to the current need, I think it is important to compile the data from the beginning of the 19H Revolution. (Press: This sentence is incomprehensible)\\nAt present, a hundred people in history have begun, I think flowers are going to start, all kinds of genres of traditional histories in our country are a flower, all should be opened together with the genre of the thesis genre. Of course, this cannot be limited to modern Chinese history, let alone 40 years of history since the Xinhai Revolution. (By: Rong mengyuan also used the genre as an excuse, further proposed to deny the leadership of Marxist historical research and reduce it to become a flower in the 'flowers'. (It is also pointed out here that his claim is 'not limited to modern Chinese history' and applies to the entire field of history.), But because of the urgent need to collate the information since the Xinhai Revolution, I would like to make recommendations in this regard. Specific recommendations are as follows:\\nFirst, the history of compiling the history since the 1911 revolution, generally from the uprising in Wuchang on October 10, 1911, to the eve of the founding of the People's Republic of China on September 30, 1949. Special questions can start before the Revolution in Xinhai, or stop after the founding of the People's Republic of China. For example, the general head of modern newspapers, which had never been compiled in the past, should begin with the appearance of modern newspapers in China at the end of the Qing Dynasty. The compilation of administrative and regional histories and toponymic changes, directly linked to today's life, should begin with the revolution in Xinhai, until the founding of the People's Republic of China. \\nSecond, the compilation content:\\n1. Chronicles. This is one of the oldest historical genres in China, and is also necessary to study history and deal with the current work. It can be as simple as 'Spring and Autumn' can also be detailed as 'General Study on Governance' or 'Renewal'; it can be all-encompassing, or can be just a special history. In conclusion, a variety of chronicles need to be written from 10 October 1911 to 30 September 1949. \\n2. Chronicle end. take things as a platform. At the end of the story, is one of the old genres of our country. You can imitate the 'story of the end of the story' covering a variety of historical events in 38 years; you can also imitate the 'San Francisco Chronicle End' embodiment of just one historical event. You can write about the end of a major historical event, such as the 'Xinhai Revolution', 'War of Resistance against Japan', etc. You can also write about a part of a major historical event, such as 'Hubei Xinhai Revolution', 'Wuchang Xinhai Revolution', 'Northeast Anti-Japanese Coalition Forces', 'Flat Guan Dajie' and so on. In short, 38 years of political, economic, military, diplomatic, cultural, educational, historical events need to be written. \\n3. Record. Based on a region, including all aspects under a regime, Cui Hong's 'Sixteen Kingdoms Spring and Autumn' takes one country as a record, 'Jin Book' was renamed 'Record', Chang Ju told Li Shu, known as 'Huayang Guozhi', historically different names; the name of the 'Border Record' published by Shaanxi Ganning border area during the war against Japan, tentatively 'recorded'. Such as 'Guangdong' during the first domestic revolutionary war, the 'revolutionary bases' during the second domestic revolutionary war, and 'liberated zones' during the war of resistance against Japan should be recorded; they can also be combined into a 'revolutionary regime record' by period and region. Secondly, warlords cut their data, each have characteristics, such as 'Yan Xishan in Shanxi' and 'Zhang Zuolin in the Northeast', can also write a variety of dictated regime records. Again, the regions directly ruled by imperialism have characteristics, such as the 'northeast pseudo-full' and the occupied areas during the war of resistance against Japan can also be described as 'enemy hypocritical regimes'. Hong Kong and Macau can also be recorded. \\n4. Chi. Narrative of the subordinate system, a special history of a discipline. From the beginning of the eight books of the history, Bangu called 'Chi', Cai Yong said 'meaning', Hua Qiao called 'code', Zhang Bo called 'record', He method plate said 'say', although the name is different, not different, to the 'tee' and more complete, now the tentative name is 'Chi', can also according to the eight-book genre, also according to the three-way genre, can also press The conference will be written about various rules and special history since the Xinhai Revolution. Due to the time, for the old history project to add, delete or modify. If you can add 'political party', 'party', etc., you can delete the 'Astronomical Journal', etc., and modify the 'food log', 'agricultural journal', 'industry journal', 'financial log', etc. \\n5. Table. Beside diagonally, so that the reader can be known, is indeed a supplement to the above various history books, reading history is one of the indispensable one. Founded in Sima Qian, spread in the future. The study of the history since the Xinhai Revolution requires not only the official tables such as 'Cabinet Table', 'List of Chiefs of Wen Wu of the Provinces', 'List of Chinese Ambassadors to Foreign Countries', 'Foreign Ambassadors to China' (the above four tables have been compiled at present), but also the previous 'List of Members of Parliament', 'Geographical Names History List', as well as economic, Table on political and cultural aspects. \\n6. pass. One of the old genres of history in China, is an indispensable information for the study of history. Revolutionary martyrs, heroes of labor, scholars and experts are certainly known, and their words and deeds have a certain contribution to society or certain influences should also be propagated. In addition, revolutionary subjects such as burglary, traitor thieves and other revolutionary subjects should also be propagated, not only to make them stink for many years, mainly to inform the people about the reality of the revolutionary struggle. As for the imperialists who invaded our country, such as Jules Dien and Stureden, are foreigners, but they have a great deal of relations with our country, and we need to know their history and to pass on it. Biographical genre many, regardless of autobiography, chronology, chronology, detailed biography, biography, monument, character should be included. \\nCompilation of information. It is one of the oldest genres of history in our country. In recent years, history workers have also done a lot of work in this area. Information since the Xinhai Revolution, regardless of archives, letters, telegrams, diaries, press records and all kinds of raw materials, should be classified or edited in a comprehensive book. \\n8. Atlas. The map is a monument of historical events and historical figures, which are evidence of historical records, which are themselves historical materials. Difficult printing conditions in the past, there is still map circulation, today photography, printing conditions convenient, more should edit the map. The revolutionary relics since the Xinhai Revolution, revolutionary artefacts, and images that illustrate the evolution of historical events such as politics, economy, military, diplomatic, cultural and education should be printed and made available to historians and workers in all sectors. \\nThe compilation of the above various types of information is generally not limited to space or style, as long as the truth is sought. However, the chronicles inherit our tradition, and must pay attention to calligraphy, namely positions, views and methods. (Press: This is also incomprehensible.), Chronicle end, record, book and table, the Lord asks that his chronicle be detailed and correct, and past works can be chosen at his discretion. The biography should be based on the collection of existing materials, regardless of the position of the author and the wording, but the main curriculum vitae of a person can always be referred to. The old days of propagation are unknown. If you make a biography in the future, of course, there should be improvement. The compilation and mapping of the data are all available. \\nThird, the publication and distribution. After a review of all kinds of information, except those at all, it can be used or selected in part should be published, and the materials that can be published may be distributed in different ways according to their specific circumstances. If the facts are true, their positions and opinions are correct, those who have an educational role for the masses should be widely publicized. (Press: The sentence of 'position, view is correct' is also added temporarily to the Second School in late June. (The manuscript here is 'many who need it.'), If only the narrative is true, information is provided to researchers, but less educating the masses, it should be limited distribution (i.e., internal distribution by historical workers). Where there are too many accounts of suspicion (or authors are reluctant to disclose, or because other conditions do not permit a large number of publishers, they should be allocated only to public authorities such as major libraries for the information of specialized in-depth researchers. \\n4. In order for the preparation to proceed smoothly, there should be a certain organization, and an editorial board should be organized with responsibility for the actual organization of manuscripts, review of manuscripts and management of publications. Under the Editorial Board, an editorial department should be established to handle all transactional tasks. The editorial board and editorial department shall be headed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences or other institutions. [Original: Rong mengyuan now more specifically proposed the establishment of an organizational body to restore old history, and this body should also be a 'state organ'. Next, he also expressed the hope that his third institute of history would facilitate this work. Rong mengyuan's anti-socialist personal ambitions of anti-party anti-socialism are really clear.] A small number of editors should be full-time, both in charge of the editorial department, and the majority should be part-time, employing experts in modern Chinese history and people who are interested in historical facts. Editorial staff should be full-time. \\nThe above recommendations are intended to the effect only and, if possible, need to be discussed by the experts on detailed plans and steps to be taken. I hope that the third Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences will promote this work. \\nBeijing, June 1, 1957\\nRong mengyuan's Big Print (May 29, 1957)\\n[Original: Rong mengyuan this big print was posted on May 29. At this time, the history of three crooked winds has emerged. A member of the Communist Youth League pseudonymous posted a 'two hope' article (full text: in order to help the party rectify, it should emphasize the shortcomings, but it cannot be completely negated. (Bad style or human error in the past should be tracked and corrected, but must start from the front, see the positive and the opposite side, otherwise a one-sided evaluation of the entire movement or work will be made.), , Rong mengyuan's big print newspaper was issued in response to this article. Rong mengyuan this big print newspaper titled 'It's too early to close the door!' , which reads as follows:]\\nSpeak to be comprehensive, but one knows it is this side, what to do, say nothing? Not comprehensive, do not say! Do not stress the disadvantages. But in fact there are drawbacks, what to do? Say no? Say it is to emphasize the shortcomings, do not say!

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached 2] Le history: 'Rong mengyuan dare to 'plagiarize' Mao Zedong works? (Kaidi 2007.8.15)\\nThe absurdity of 'anti-right' in 1957 may be to let many people who wanted to keep up with the situation consciously transformed, at a time by the 'reactionary' stick mistreatment. Rong mengyuan is probably an example. The following article is tired of Rong's reactionary words and deeds, accusing him of being 'against Marxism in the garment of Marxism,' a 'liar in history,' and it is clear that his previous confession of faith in 'Marxism' is now all his guilt. And their previous experiences by little bit were also dug out to show the public. Originally both honesty expressed support in politics, why should you talk about the previous thing, at that time, persuading many intellectuals to stay, I believe lobbyists are basically telling these people 'not to blame', as long as they are willing to be 'new people', past history There is nothing to do with any problems in history. It is not that Zhang Shizhao is also popular, let's mention you guys this matter. But Zhang Shizhao, who has all the skills of the day, is only a special case. Many people later became 'blamed in the past', such as Rong mengyuan's previous 'youth gang' experience, then became 'strong evidence' of his 'reactionary nature', however, in the Republic of the people carrying the 'youth gangs' such as an interpersonal umbrella In too much, as a result, by the 1950s, 1960s, political movements hit, 'umbrella' full Become a deadly. The most ridiculous charge of Rong mengyuan's 'guilt' was the plagiarism of the collection of Mao Zedong. Le Zedong wanted to come today, probably Rong's quoting a large section of Mao's words at that time, but only wanted to increase the political insurance coefficient for his 'work' and to avoid attacking his writings lacked political nature. What may not have been imagined, however, is that 'over-referencing' Mao Zedong became the primary evidence of his 'plagiarism.' The situation makes people like this, really pleasing. \\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached 3】People's Daily: 'In the garment of Marxism against Marxist right-wing Rong mengyuan is a liar in history' (1957.8.14)\\n[Newsletter] For nearly half a month, all the personnel of the third Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have met continuously to expose and criticize the reactionary words and actions of Rong mengyuan, a right-wing researcher of the Institute. A number of people who had been under his command or used by him also made a number of accounts. In June, Rong mengyuan wrote an article entitled 'Proposals to Compile Historical Materials Since the Revolution of Xinhai' was published in New Construction. The content of this article is actually a complement to the history aspects of the Alliance's 'Scientific Platform'. \\nRong mengyuan in this 'platform' opposes Marxism's guiding role in historical research and advocates the restoration of old history. His approach was to remove the guidance of Marxism under the cover of slogans advocating the coexistence of various genres, emphasizing the importance of information and inheritance of tradition. He accused that 'the history since the Xinhai Revolution... only (changed to 'more than' when published), 'to replace everything with papers, which hinders the research of historical science.' He thinks there is no need to accept criticism of China's historical tradition using a Marxist perspective, but suggested that 'all genres of traditional history in our country are a flower, they must be open together with the flower of the paper genre.' And 'first of all, we should inherit the excellent historical traditions of our country and write data of various genres'. He actually wants to replace everything with feudal, capitalist old histories, or to fight Marxist chambers with feudal, bourgeoisie thinking. Rong mengyuan made a vicious attack against the party's ideological leadership. He distorted what some party members said, and then aggressively attacked, saying: 'Some people say 'what the chronicle is what it is, 'research is bourgeoisie think', 'This is a mere business view', 'This is a purely business view', 'This is out of politics.' I think this is very ignorant and not a scientific attitude.'. This paragraph is even more vicious in his manuscript. The original text is 'I think this statement is very ignorant, but can only be slandered, dare not to say it, the abdominal slander should be killed, but nothing said, others do not know, what does it do to me!' This shows that he is very hateful for the Party's criticism of the bourgeois thought. Rong mengyuan fabricated facts in the 'platform' to incite provocation. \\nDuring the whole wind, Rong mengyuan made public articles on the one hand attacking the party, and on the one hand carried out a series of activities to stigmatize the opposition party in the past three. He first argued that three criticisms of his anti-party sectarian activities in 1953 were 'conspiracy framed.' The fact is: before 1953, Rong mengyuan engaged in small groups in his house to carry out anti-party sectarian activities with extremely bad influence. In October 1953, under the leadership of the Party, the entire staff seriously criticized their sectarian activities. However, Rong mengyuan did not repense, and this time using the opportunity of the whole wind, maliciously slander the party. \\nRong mengyuan cooperated with right-wing research intern Zhang Zhenhe from the beginning. Other right-wing elements inside the house and some people with misminds are also rallying under the door, spreading reactionary remarks and carrying out ignition activities. For one time, Rong mengyuan actually became the central figure of the three rightists in history. \\nRong mengyuan's anti-party activities are consistent. He was born in the landlord's family and took part in the revolution in 1932. But at the critical juncture of the revolution, the party was rebellied, automatically surrendered to the KMT and betrayed the Revolutionary Comrades. Since then, he joined the youth gang of the reactionary group and voted to become an apprentice under a division under the department of the warlord Sun Chuanfang. During the 1929 movement, concealed their reactionary history and mixed into the Party. In 1941, anti-party activities continued in Yan'an, openly opposition Central Northwest Bureau, and was expelled from the party. At the end of 1953, after criticizing his anti-party sectarian activities, the party continued to help him and expressed confidence in him and entrusted him with a lot of work. But the essence of this right-wing ambition has not changed. \\nIn recent days of criticism, everyone also pointed out: Rong mengyuan, this ambition man has a little false name in society. Some people treat him as a Marxist 'historian', in fact, he is a liar in history. \\nPlagiarism of the work of others is a prominent phenomenon in Rong mengyuan's 'writings'. For example, his book 'The History of China's Recent Centennial Revolution,' is a large number of plagiarism and plagiarism, patchwork into books. The first section of the first chapter of this book totals more than 1,800 words, almost all citing Mao Zedong's Collection. But he cite only over 700 of them, and the remaining 800 words plagiarize as his own 'creation'. \\nWorse still, he used the convenience of editing 'materials of modern history' to suppress the manuscripts of others and put others into his own research. Mr. Zhang Guogan wrote a draft of 'History of the Xinhai Revolution' (not yet published), to Rong Meng Yuanti for comments. He took the opportunity to copy the material about Hong Shu Zu in his book. \\nAt the critical meeting, the masses unanimously pointed out that Rong mengyuan is a poor quality, deceiving right-wing ambition, and wants him to make a thorough account of his reactionary words and deeds! (People's Daily 1957.8.14)\\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached Four】Cao Youqin: Liu Dennian or confession for good (Wutong drizzle literature network 2007.9.19)\\nOn July 25, 1995, when Liu Dennian's 80th birthday, the Institute of Modern History of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the Chinese History Society jointly held a symposium to celebrate the birth of the historian. Each participant received a 'Bibliography of Comrade Liu Dainian', which contains two articles, 'Refuting an absurd proposal-a historical view of criticizing Rong mengyuan's anti-Marxism' and 'Wu Han's counter-revolutionary face'. On the spot, a scholar objected and protested. Liu Dennian explained himself, saying, 'That's part of my personal history... does not mean that I still hold that view.' \\nThus, some people thought Mr. Liu Danien was 'unwritten, not hidden' and praised his brilliant personality qualities. He then introduced the background of Mr. Liu Danien's two articles: 'The very day that critical Rong mengyuan's article was published on the first day when the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences held critical historians, Rong mengyuan.' Similarly, the articles criticizing Wu Han are also written in the same social context. So this is 'Yingjing article', 'compliance literature'. In one word, is the article that had to be done (5.21, The Learning Times). \\nHowever, since Mr. Liu Danien 'published his article criticizing Rong mengyuan was the first day when the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences held critical historians, Rong mengyuan', then Liu Dennian apparently completed his 'masterpiece' criticizing Rong mengyuan before criticizing Rong mengyuan 'that day'., seems not to be a rush of 'the scene' of it. \\nIn addition, did Liu Danian not understand that Rong mengyuan should be criticized? If Liu Dennian originally thought that Rong mengyuan's doctrine was an 'historical view of anti-Marxism,' then Liu Dainian was originally a big 'left'. It would be no surprise to write a critical article that criticized Rong mengyuan. Why could it be 'Yingjing'? If you write articles that criticize Rong mengyuan and Wu Han, just 'Yingjing', just 'abide by duty', then people should ask, what is the starting point of this 'Yingjing' and 'criticism'? It is not hard to see that Liu Dainian's 'political smell' is very sensitive. Previously, he felt that the 'storm' would be running, he hurried to 'stand the team', using his own pen to declare that he had stood on the 'left' side. In this way, his starting point necessarily contains his deep intentions, by lifting the stick to others to protect himself from the 'storm'. Although this is a 'conventional weapon' for many people in the Cultural Revolution, as an honest scholar, so throwing the academic conscience aside to whip academic colleagues to 'follow the wind' to survive, I think it is a shame. In that kind of 'big background' environment, followed by the flood shouting two slogan 'down', or writing two critical articles similar to the 'tabloid copy', or as a 'getaway', to remain silent, the future is understandable. In comparison, Liu Dennian's 'positive performance' in that year was a shameful trip that waited for it. \\nAuthor Liu Baiyu published an open letter in the Great Wall magazine, deeply saddened that the writer Xu Guangyao was beaten as 'the right in the military' decades ago: 'The pain you suffered in that journey was caused by my sins', 'only in a distance to you deeply appreciate sin, thank you for sin.' This is a sincere repentance due to the conscience of self-blame, although it is a late confession, may not help the person concerned, but for Liu Baiyu himself is a kind of purification of the soul and contributed a conscience to society. \\nAfter the nightmare of the 'Cultural Revolution', Barkin saw again the Hu Feng that has 'mourn, no angry', thinking of criticizing the Hu Feng movement, he, as chairman of Shanghai collaboration, once had to 'preside over several critical meetings' 'wrote three articles' criticizing Hu Feng. The content of the article is 'what others have said', but he is still deeply guilty, always feel 'owed debt', always feel 'what seems to block my chest, do not spit out, always feel breathable', to 'write something', in order to 'compensate for the past damage to his dead friend'. So he wrote 'Miss Hu Feng.' He said, 'Although no one came out to admit 'responsibility' for what mistakes, I'm not responsible for throwing stones at the wellhead?' People feel Barkin's deep sense of self-remorse and self-repentance. Barkin unrelentlessly dissected himself and blame for his past 'defiance', his sincerity, authenticity, truth, will naturally win the respect of the world. \\nIn comparison with everyone Liu Baiyu and Barkin, one cannot fail to ask, why did Mr. Liu Danien not go into writing, saying that he spoke of his self-blame and confession for criticizing Rong mengyuan and Wu Han in the past? Is it because Mr. Liu Dainian does not feel a kind of remorse or shame for that past experience, or does he want to show his high level of high calibre with silence? Just gently saying that the two articles 'does not mean I still hold that view'. That is the historical environment that makes sense of mind? Is it possible to push people into 'a Buddha born, two Buddha ascension' (Ji Xianlin language), can also be pushed to the 'big environment', the same peace of mind? Especially for an intellectual who should have a conscience? \\nZhang Bojun is a big 'right' that Chinese people know all about. That is, because he made a 'bicameral proposition' at a symposium in the spring of 1957. The truth of history is that he made this claim because he came to two o'clock in the morning of attending the symposium, United Front Front Minister Li Weihan called Zhang Bojun, saying that Chairman Liu Shaoqi had the meaning of implementing bicameral system, but he did not speak well within the party, hoping that Zhang Bojun raised it at the symposium. Because Zhang Bojun is a democratic party, it is better to speak. In the Cultural Revolution, Zhang Bojun's days are, of course, worse. On a certain day in the spring of 1967, a 'villain' came to Zhang Bojun and said, 'We found that Liu Shaoqi had proposed a two-chamber approach to the upper and lower house in our country as early as December 1956. You made it only in the spring of 1957. It is clear that your bicameral proposition was heard from Liu Shaoqi. You should put this out, which is good for you.' Zhang Bojun silenced for a while and calmly said: 'I have been studying abroad for many years. I know more about the parliamentary system and bicameral system of European and American countries than Liu Shaoqi. My bicameral system is my own idea for many years and has nothing to do with Liu Shaoqi!' The 'villains' repeatedly questioned, hard and soft, but Zhang Bojun has always been unmoved. By comparison, don't Liu Dennian feel blush? Don't you feel a lack of calcium in the bones? Shouldn't there be more reflection? \\nMr. Ji Xianlin said to those who had done bad things in the Cultural Revolution era, 'If there is still a little conscience, a little sane, in the light of the red wine and green, ask yourself at the early night, can you sleep well?' 'Why can't you stand up in the psychological state and torture process of torturing yourself as an article or a book?' 'The educational significance for our people, especially for our future generations, will be immense' (Ji Xianlin 'Cattle Depot Memories'). \\nI respect Mr. Liu Dalin, looking forward to Mr. Liu Dalin think more about Liu Bai Yu and Barkin, a good reading, experience Mr. Ji's true and good words, and then have some repentance. \\n"},

Immediately after the beginning of the wind, he attacked the party viciously, defaming 'Communist members have two sources-subjectivity and bureaucracy; one component-sectarianism.' 'What the Communist Party loves is people who laugh at their shoulders, listen to the words of singing praise and morality. Those who see a straight neck are not used to see, and they can't hear bad things.' He said, 'It's not as good as the Qing Dynasty!' He distorted history and provoked: 'In the Qing Dynasty, the Menghan people still have no trouble at peace, but now, they are all seven dead and eight lives of each other!' He is not shameful as the 'mahatma' of the Tumet flag (west of Hohhot), referring to Gandhi of India. There is an irrational phenomenon of the coexistence of flag counties in the Domet flag. After liberation, the party and the Government, in order to strengthen national unity, resolved them in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the people of Monkhans on the ground. But Rong Xiang used this massive attack and said: 'What the KMT cannot do, the Communist Party has done it.' He incited the Mongolian people of the native Murt flag, who was drawn to Hohhot, saying, 'You have found your maiden, and no one will speak for you. In the future, there is no justice, I have to come to my old man.' Implied that only he was the mother and mother of the Mongolian people of the Turkite flag. \\nHe also created divisions within the nation, hard dividing the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region into two separate parts of East and West rival. He said that the Mongolian from the east have 'closenism', and we western Mongolian have to have a 'doorist'. And he said, 'Eastern Mongolians choke the western Mongolian whole enough! But they (referring to eastern Mongolia), did not dare to bully my old man, and my old man has registered a number with Chairman Mao.' \\nRong Xiang was born from a feudal aristocratic family. He relied on Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan to climb the Throne of Dumot Flag When Chiang Kai-shek published the notorious 'The Fate of China', denying the existence of national minorities in China, and thus provoking the public outrage of the people of all ethnic groups across the country, Rong Xiang went along with his voice and published the 'Mongolian homology theory', advocating what 'Mongolian nation is the descendants of the Huang Emperor, a branch of the Han people' and other absurd The tone. \\nAfter the victory of the resistance war, Rong xiang's reactionary activities were more rampant. In 1947, the KMT reactionaries attacked the grasslands and slaughtered the people of Inner Mongolia, but he asked the people of Inner Mongolia not to resist the KMT government. He issued a reactionary 'message', advising the Inner Mongolia compatriots to withdraw from the liberation war. He said that this is a bipartisan dispute between the Communist Party and has nothing to do with His 'message' played a great reactionary effect. At that time, the Mugdunbao of the Zahar League followed up with peace, put into the arms of the reactionary rulers of the KMT and embarked on the road against the people. After the KMT occupied Yan'an, Rong Xiang published the so-called Book of Suing Mongolian Youth, calling on them to abandon the implicit (communist party), proposition (KMT). \\nThe scum of this shameless Mongolian people also organized a delegation to celebrate the anti-Japanese Mongolian flag in 1946, and headed his own delegation, went to Nanjing to 'Jin Gu' Chiang Kai-shek, presenting Jiang the flag of 'Heshan Reinvented' and the Royal Sword used by Kangxi Kangxi Kar Dan (Mongolian national hero). (People's Daily, July 28, 1957)\\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Appendix 2] Xinhua News Agency: 'Repression of Mongolian Flag People before Liberation and Destroying National Unity: Mongolian Right Rong xiang has always been anti-Communist against the people'\\n(Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, August 27, 1957), The right-wing Rong xiang (Mongolian ethnic group), has been uncovered. After more than a month of struggle with Mongolian and Han, Back and Manmanni people, honorable rhetoric was poor and forced to confess guilt. \\nRong xiang is the deputy mayor of Hohhot and a member of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Committee. Since his liberation, he has been dissatisfied with the new society, spreading poison and evil rhetoric around. After the beginning of the campaign, one of the important objectives of his attack on the people was to undermine the unity between the Communist Party and the Mongolian nation, between the Mongolian and Han nationalities, and within the Mongolian nation. He slandered, 'It is not as good as the Qing Dynasty,' and said upside down in black and white: 'The people of Menghan in the Qing dynasty are still not at peace, but now? But each other is seven dead and eight lives. After liberation, the Communist Party and the Government resolved them in accordance with the wishes of most of the people of Monkhans on the ground in order to strengthen national unity. But Rong Xiang used this massive attack and said what: 'What the Kuomintang cannot do, the Communist Party has done it.' He incited the Mongolian people who were assigned to the city of Hohhot and said, 'You have found your maiden, and no one will speak for you.' He also created divisions within the Mongolian nation, hard dividing the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region into two parts of East and West rival, saying, 'The Mongolian people from the east have 'closenism''. Rong Xiang also defamed the Communist Party and the political systems of our country. 'The Communist Party has two sources-subjectivity and bureaucracy; one component-sectarianism,' he said. 'Old bureaucrats are learning to transform, new bureaucrats are developing, really alternating between new and old bureaucrats,' he said. 'The Communist Party has no way to go to the ground.' \\nIt was revealed that Rong xiang anti-Communist anti-people were consistent, and he was called 'the earth king' before liberation. He has served as a member of the Tibetan Committee of the Kuomintang Party and a member of the Second Political Council of Shanxi Province, as well as head of the Tumot flag. He has published the 'Mongolian homology theory', saying that the Mongolian nation is a pro-support fallacy for the Han people, helping the KMT reactionaries to pursue a policy of assimilation and enslavement of the Mongolian nation. During the People's Liberation War, Rong Xiang also issued anti-Communist speeches such as the Book of Suffer to Mongolian Youth, which asked the Mongolian people and young people to 'proclaim (KMT), to abandon (refer to the Communist Party)'. \\nIn the last month, the Mongolian people and Rong xiang have engaged in a face-to-face struggle with Rong xiang at an expanded meeting of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the CPPCC. Mongolian cadres and people from various organs, different strata have also published articles in newspapers to expose and reject the glorious anti-Communist and anti-people words and deeds. At the anti-right meeting convened by the Inner Mongolia CPPCC, the Mongolian people in the city of Hohhot smashed the honorable words with their happy life under the leadership of the Communist Party and intimate unity. The change of the Tumet flag is used to illustrate the different experiences of Mongolian ethnic groups in old and new societies. They pointed out that in the Ming Dynasty, the Tumet flag could send 300,000 troops. After the reign of the Qing Dynasty and the Kuomintang until the early liberation period, only more than 20,000 Mongolian remained. \\nWith regard to the past situation of Qi County coexistence, many speakers pointed out that this was the result of the KMT's policy of division and rule against the people of Monhan, which was extremely detrimental to the cause of emancipation and the development of the Mongolian people. After the abolition of Qi County coexistence, the Mongolian population living in Hohhot made up 5.27 per cent of the city's population, while the Mongolian deputies represented 16.75 per cent of the total number of deputies in the Hohhot City People's Congress. The participants refuted the rhetoric against the anti-Communist people article by article. He was forced to confess guilt after Rong xiang's lies undermining national relations were completely debunked. \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 4"}

Since the reform and opening-up, his contribution to China's reform and development has been known to many people. However, his encounter with the anti-right movement in 1957 and his rebellion were little known. This article, Ji Honggeng has been a regular interview with CITIC Company as a reporter of People's Daily, and has had 20 years of contact with Rong yiren. \\n'Small open faction' often together to communicate the situation, exchange views, some people think they engage in small circles\\nThe anti-right of the Shanghai business community began in June and July 1957. Rong yiren, Sheng Kangnian, by Shu Ping, Yan Esheng and others more together, often eat together and chat. Rong yiren and Sheng Kang years are 'small open' (in old Shanghai and Jiangnan areas, the boss's son is often called 'small open'). On the eve of the liberation of Shanghai, the Rong family has moved overseas. Rong yiren made the decision to stay in Shanghai and gradually became the representative of Rong's family business. In 1950, he joined China's Democratic National Assembly and served as the Standing Committee of Civil Construction Central Committee and Vice Chairman of Shanghai Municipal Committee. In the socialist transformation of capitalist business and industry, it was the first to take all the enterprises out of joint ventures with the state. \\nIn 1957, was elected deputy mayor of Shanghai, and vice chairman of Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce. In the early years of Sheng Kang, he called for progress, close to the Party, and did a lot of work for the Chinese revolution. After the liberation of Shanghai was entrusted by deputy mayor Pan Hannian, has been in contact with the business community, held a leading position in the municipal Federation of Commerce and Industry, and also served as deputy secretary general of the Shanghai CPPCC. Jing Shuping, former secretary general of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the People's Political Consultative Conference, the Municipal Federation of Commerce and Industry, and Rong yiren were students before and after the university. Yan Esheng, served as deputy secretary general of Shanghai Municipal Committee of Minjian, deputy editor of Shanghai News Daily, deputy director of Shanghai Industry and Commerce Bureau since 1955. Several of them often eat together, meet and chat. They are more active at the 'star dinner party' formed by the 'July 1 Learning Club', often together to communicate and exchange views. At that time, some people thought they were involved in small circles, and Sheng Kang had been criticized for this. On the eve of the anti-right movement, Rong yiren, Sheng Kang year, and his uncle equality often come together to discuss the Party and Government's guidelines and policies. When the big song enlarged, the opinions they raised were more sharp, there were also bias. Some people who originally thought they were involved in small circles, said that they conspired to plan and pull up gangs, squeezed the left in the Federation of Commerce and Industry and the Civil Construction, and attacked activists; said Rong yiren used the 'Simingtang incident' to set fire clouds. \\n'Si Ming Tang incident' Rong yiren thinks that dealing with injustice is wrong. However, people with knife and wounds are involved in legal and discipline issues\\n'Simingtang incident' refers to the official representative of Simingtang Pharmacy Bureau, Yan'an Road, Shanghai. This private manager (boss), usually has a bad attitude towards the buddy, and contradicts sharply with the official representative (formerly an apprentice). One day, a quarrel occurred between the two sides, and the apprentice broke fire for a moment, scratched the boss's arm with a fruit knife. After the incident, the deputy governor and others went to investigate and deal with, pointing out that it was wrong to hurt people with fruit knives, but the apprenticeship's reckless move also hoped that the private side could understand and resolve it by consultation between the two sides After learning about this, Rong yiren, who has always been right and has a strong idea of the rule of law, did not consider personal gains and losses. He believed that dealing with injustice was wrong. However, people with knife wounds involved legal discipline issues. He made a speech on 'To promote democracy, it must maintain law and discipline' at a meeting in the city. So things are big. Some people grabbed the matter and said that he fomented the fire and said they were 'Rongsheng Small Group'. Prior to this, Rong yiren and others attended the joint meeting of the National Federation of Commerce and Industry in Beijing. Li Weihan, head of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, specifically asked Rong yiren, Sheng Pihua and Xiang De (chairman of Hunan Federation of Industry and Commerce), to invite them to eat. During the table, Li Weihan said: 'Chairman Mao said that you three do not hit the right wing, but have to go back to check.' The worried Rong yiren originally thought: 'This time some of our representatives are about to be finished.' Listened to Li Weihan's conveys, no imagination in the horrific waves to see the top of the disaster, met to rescue the ship, the heart of the indelible gratitude, has been shrouded in the heart of the grief mist, finally dispersed. \\nAt a critical juncture, after the 'Three Counters' and the Five Counters' movements, Mao Zedong once again came forward to protect Rong yiren. Rong yiren returned to Shanghai. At that time, the first secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee, Ke Qingshi, met with him, and appointed Sun Gengduo, deputy director of Shanghai Municipal Committee of Civil Construction, and vice director of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce Du Dagong specifically to help him. Sun Gengrudo said with humor: 'I was instructed to accompany my son to read. A accompany son, two accompany Sheng son. Sheng Pi Hua (then deputy mayor of Shanghai), came to my house to visit me and asked me to help his son Sheng Kang Nian.' At the meetings held by the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce and Civil Construction, criticism of the Shengkang year was quite strong. Shengkang years due to the fixed rate for 20 years unchanged (fixed rate 5 percent, 20 years that means full recovery of capital), and other remarks, the fight is more powerful. Rong yiren did not have much direct criticism. Instead, a few people spoke with him at his house, sometimes let him go to the municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and the joint meetings of the Civil Construction Association to conduct self-examination, and we give opinions. Rong yiren and Sheng Kang Year were not less inspected during the whole wind anti-right movement. Sheng Kang has written 11 written representations, Yan Esheng also wrote 9 materials. \\nIn the anti-right movement, the 'Rongsheng small group' black pot has been carrying\\nOn August 1, 1957, from 4 to 8 pm, Rong yiren talked to Rong yiren when Chen Mingshan, Zhu Gongjian, Liu Nianyi, and others in Shanghai Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and Civil Construction. He said, 'Without talking about the truth, talking about small things, I am dependent on the party.' Under Sun Gengrudo, Du Dagong and other tasks under Libao, Rong yiren, Sheng Kang Year and so on in the anti-right movement, but the black pot of the 'Rongsheng Small Group' has been carrying. After the anti-right movement, Shengkang in the years of thought burden was heavier, has been unable to open, so that every day is stuffy, alcoholism, the stomach was sick, died in October 1965 due to esophageal cancer, only 51 years old. \\nAfter the anti-right movement in the 1950s, Rong yiren has been carrying the black pot 'Rongsheng Small Group'. Moreover, in the 'Cultural Revolution', the old books and new accounts together, Rong Yi Ren's family was once broken into by red guards and became a battered arena. Rong yiren's right index finger was interrupted, and the left eye was blinded due to delays in treatment. Mrs. Rong yiren Yang Jianqing was beaten to death to live, bedridden for many years. Even so, Rong yiren also asked the vice-minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee to transmit to Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai: 'I have a decision with the Party! The heart of the red, moving! \\nThe days of dark clouds tumbling and demons are finally over. The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee in December 1978 sounded the trumpet of China's reform and opening up. January 1979, HYPERLINK 'http://www.qingdaonews.com/node/dengxiaoping.htm\\\\\\ n _blank Deng Xiaoping invited Rong yiren and other 5 China's business community celebrated people. Deng Xiaoping suggested that in order to achieve socialist modernization, it must be opened up to the outside world and the introduction of foreign capital and technology. He hoped that Rong yiren would reduce some other work, concentrate on the construction of the motherland's economy and break out a new path. In February, Rong yiren submitted 'Some preliminary opinions on the proposed establishment of an international investment trust company' to the central government. In October 1979, China International Trust Investment Corporation was established in Beijing. This can be described as one of the earliest windows for China's reform and opening up. Rong yiren personally served as the chairman and general manager of CITIC Corporation. Many of its main members are old friends of Shanghai's business community who are familiar with the market economy by Rong yiren, including the so-called 'Rongsheng Small Group' during the anti-right movement in 1957. At that time, trust investments were seen by many as something with capitalism. Some people say, 'It seems that Rong yiren's bitter head has not been eaten enough!' Rong yiren understands that this is pun. He said frankly: 'Are we not all wrong cases? Small group matter we can complain. Now is the time for us to contribute to the reform and opening up. With the support of Comrade Xiaoping and the Party Central Committee, I see nothing to fear.' \\nThe creation and development of CITIC is a masterpiece of Rong yiren's old age and is his major contribution. Although he was still carrying the historical burden of 'Rongsheng Small Group', but because of his degree of openness and deep feelings towards the party, he did not count personal grudges, endure the burden of humiliation, overcome difficulties, boldly innovate, what to do, so that CITIC has achieved a big development. It was not until 1983 that he formally raised the issue of 'Rongsheng Small Group'. \\nAfter Hu Yaobang learned, immediately gave instructions: the Central United Front Department should completely repudiate it.\\nIn 1983 and 1984, Rong yiren had two talks with Li Ding, then vice-minister of the United Front Department of the Central Committee, to discuss the issue of 'Rongsheng Small Group' in the 1950s. Rong yiren said: 'Although the central government kept us down at that time, there were people in the Cultural Revolution, the Central Learning Group of the Civil Building and the Federation of Commerce and Industry again took this matter to the whole person. After the uncle is not less fighting for this. At that time, some leaders of the two sessions took the lead in ordering my name at the meeting, leading my big print.' 'Although it has been years since we have come out of work, and in fact we have been able to say we have done a good deal, but these comrades never said an apology to me. So far, we can't worry about meeting, chatting, eating with some old friends.' Li Ding reported the incident to Yang Jingren, minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee. \\nHu Yaobang, who was then General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, immediately gave instructions: on this, the United Front Department of the Central Committee should completely repudiate it. Rong yiren is still not the right. Why is it still not so far? On August 4, 1984, the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee issued a report to Xi Zhongxun, who is in charge of the daily work of the Central Secretariat and the Central Secretariat, stating that the so-called 'Rongsheng Small Group' issue should be rehabilitated, and the Shanghai Municipal Committee's United Front Work Department reached a formal conclusion on this matter. After obtaining Rong yiren's consent, the persons and lists involved in this matter were officially issued Bit to eliminate the minds of Rong yiren and others. On August 9, Xi Zhongxun instructed: 'Agree with the opinion of the United Front War Department of Central China. Comrade Rong Yijen is still Gu Quan's overall situation. Ask Comrade Jing Ren and Li Ding to do a good job of unity and put a close to some of the mistakes in history. The United Front Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee immediately proceeded to carry out this work after receiving a review instruction from the Central United Front Department. Examined the documents files of 1957 and 1958 Municipal Committee for Private Reform Office, the United Front Department of Municipal Committee and the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce in the period against the right, and listened to the introduction of comrades. On December 27, 1984, the United Front Work Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee wrote a review report to the municipal committee: the so-called nature of small groups, when the municipal committee of the private reform office mistakenly believed in the situation report: the leadership of the Shanghai business community for several years was in fact held by a small group that was proud and shouldered. Although this group is not a fundamentally anti-Communist anti-people anti-socialist right-wing group, in recent years every struggle against me on major issues... they are abstracted by support, concrete opposition and oral disapproval of the party's leadership and socialism. Therefore, the solution of Rong yiren issue in Shanghai and the dismantling of Rongsheng Group will be an important key to a comprehensive rectification campaign in the business community, including the fight against the right. The review report concluded that during the period of 1957, it was wrong to expose and criticize the comrades Rong yiren and other comrades with the so-called 'Rong Sheng Xiao Group', and it was a reflection of the anti-right expansion. Such 'left' mistakes, which seriously undermine the relationship between the party and business elites, undermine their unity and frustrate the motivation of these comrades, the effects of which have not yet been cleared. In order to lift the minds of comrades Rong yiren and other comrades, remove their concerns and better mobilize their enthusiasm to serve the reunification of the motherland and the construction of the four-hua, the so-called 'Rongsheng Small Group' should be completely negated. Based on this, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the United Front Work Department made the 'Review Conclusion on the Issue of Rongsheng Small Group': the so-called 'Rongsheng Small Group' does not exist, this is a reflection of the expansion against the right. In order to completely correct the 'left' error, the issue of the so-called 'Rongsheng Small Group' criticized by the Standing Committee of the two Conferences of Shanghai in 1957 was completely negated, and the relevant materials were destroyed, and the impact was removed within the corresponding scope. In August 1985, Wang Dekuan, deputy director of the United Front Department of the Central Committee sent five bureau officers to solicit Rong yiren's opinions on the report of the Shanghai Municipal Committee United Front Committee on the review situation and opinions of the 'Rongsheng Small Group' and the review conclusions. 'I agree with this report and conclusions,' Rong said. On the eve of the struggle against the right in 1957, I and several comrades in Sheng Kang and Jingping, but often talk together about the policy and policy of the party and the government. There is no problem of anti-socialism against the party, and there is no problem of struggling with the party at all times. The impact of this on business is bad. At that time, some people said that business and business friends should have less contact, do not discuss national events, let alone express any opinions publicly. This negative impact has been for many years. Once the Cultural Revolution came to the end, the issue was moved out. It is because of this problem almost out of chaos. This negative effect remains after crushing the gangs of the four. When I formed a China International Trust Investment Corporation in 1979, my business friends warned me: Why do you have to start this? Why not learn the lessons of 1957? Actually, I personally have no problems. The Central Committee understands me, trusts me, and does not engage in counterproductive conclusions, but eliminating the impact is big. The views of the Shanghai Municipal Committee on the total negation of small groups and the elimination of their impact are correct. I am in favour of making this issue publicly clear among business friends in Beijing and Shanghai, in order to create an atmosphere in which everyone dares to speak and dare to do things, and to focus on contributing to the construction of 'four huahua'. I would like to thank the United Front Front Department for doing a lot of work on this matter.' 'I think there will also be a process of understanding within the Party on this issue,' Rong yiren said at the seminar on the issue of 'Rongsheng Small Group'. \\nOn the afternoon of September 18, 1985, the United Front War Department of the Central Committee held a symposium on the 'Rongsheng Small Group' issue in the middle floor of the Beijing Hotel. The symposium was presided over by Yang Jingren, minister of the United Front Work Department of Chen Xin, secretary-general of the United Front Department of the Central Committee of the Central Committee of the CPC Central Committee, read out the 'Review Conclusions on the Issue of Rongsheng Small Group', and vice-minister Li Ding spoke. He said: 'During the anti-right struggle in 1957, the false criticism of Rong yiren, Sheng Kang Year, Jingping, Yan Esing and other comrades with the so-called 'Rongsheng Small Group' was an error of 'left' and a reflection of the serious expansion of the anti-right struggle. To a large extent, the Central United Front Department is responsible for this error. Here, we apologize to Rong yiren and Uncle equal comrades.' \\nRong yiren made a speech at the symposium. 'It is very exciting to attend today,' he said. The United Front Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee to counteract this wrong case was a wise decision, reflecting the Party's spirit of truth-seeking truth. I am very grateful to the party and thank you very much. To be realistic, there are mistakes that must be corrected, I believe the country will move towards prosperity. Comrade Li Ding apologized for the compensation ceremony. I am afraid to (Yang Jingren interpolated: I should apologize for compensation. He was on behalf of the Central United Front Department. We caught it a little late.), I think there will be a process of understanding of this issue within the party. Completely flat against me is a great consolation. For more than 30 years, I have not centrifugal from the party, and after deepening my understanding of the party, I have not gone back. Despite this movement, and in such a situation, I still believe in the leadership of the party. For me, the party is trusted, but the 'small group' issue still has an impact on business and industry. When I went to business friends to form a trust investment company in 1979, comrades said that they were still less, not good enough to come to another group in the future. So, I asked to figure out the question. I believe that by clarifying this issue, it will be more helpful to business, to the country, to the party, to socialism.' \\nJing Shu-Ping also spoke at the symposium. He said, 'Before 1957, we saw what we thought of, right and wrong, and always felt good to talk about it. This was done in 1957, but by the Cultural Revolution turned out, and he was always in a passive position in the movement. I am grateful for this spirit of truth now.' Zhou Suqiong, the wife of Sheng Kangnian living in Shanghai, said that it was possible to reassure the consolation year in the spirit of heaven. On July 1, 1985, Rong yiren realized what he had had from the 1950s: gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party, and the great patriotism became a great communist warrior. \\n"},

He said that the members of the small group headed by Rong yiren and Sheng Kangnian are: Jing Shu Ping, Yan Esheng, Liu Nianyi, Beard, Wu Zhongyi, Tang Zhiyao (Wu and Tang are not the core). \\nIn 1955, when the National Congress of Civil Construction began to differentiate, Liu Nianyi and beard baby left the small group. The core of the small group remains Rong, Sheng, Jing, Yan four people. Outside the core peripherals (different shades, used by Sheng Kangnian), are Wu Zhichao, Wu Zhongyi, Jiang Bosheng (Jiang Hesheng is a vertical system), Wu Zhenshan, Tang Zhiyao, Wang Chunfang, Yao Ziliang, Rong Hongren, Wang Jiayuan, Jian Rong, and Wang Junliang. This small group plays a role in the National Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Central Central Committee of Civil Construction, Shanghai Federation of Commerce and Industry, Shanghai Civil Development Association and the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPPCC. There are two main aspects of their activities: on the one hand, placing themselves in various positions and combating activists close to the party, and on the other, attacking the party and working class on important events such as taxation, finance, labour, socialist transformation, etc. \\nHe talked about a lot of small group arranging people. He said to arrange people in two ways, one is to drill in; one is to pull it out. The former, such as Xiang Shu-xiang, by Rong yiren nominated by Rong yiren as Deputy Secretary of the National Federation of Commerce and Industry; Yan Esheng, Prince Jian, Lei Pingyi, Wang Maode and so on to the CDC. Those pulled out such as Sheng Kang Nian nominated Che Maozhang and Sun Shanzhang as the secretary of the four groups of the CPPCC, connecting the Federation of Commerce and Industry to four groups (the four groups of the CPPCC were led by Shengkang Year). \\nYan also revealed that after Panhan's arrest, Sheng said, 'No one in the North is unofficial.' Yan thinks that the relationship between Sheng and Panhannian should be explained. Five anti-time Sheng was struggles, Pan went to Jie Wai, Sheng thinks Pan 'has courage', scolded Xu Dixin is 'cattle', scolded Chen Shutong 'no bones', said Cai Bei Hua is incompetent, Du Duke 'proud complacency', Yang Shu-ming is 'rogue style'. \\nYan thinks that Shengkang's anti-party behavior is consistent. Last year, some people in the CPPCC criticized Sun Dayu, Sheng opposed it. In an article written last year with the 'Ahan' pseudonym in the 'public news', said that party members are 'small tycoon', the artifact is 'jumping beam clown'. Sheng also said to Yan: 'It is not appropriate for the Central Central Committee of Civil Construction to stop Zhang's duties soon.' In his speech, Han Zhiming revealed that Sheng Kang was using him as a sit-in for the Federation of Commerce and Industry and asked him to report. \\n(Internal Reference, Xinhua News Agency, July 24, 1957)\\n"},

Line check, and expand mutual criticism. \\nIn the afternoon, Qian Sunqing, a bourgeois right-wing member, also gave an account at the meeting. \\nRong yiren, deputy chairman of the National Federation of Industry and Commerce and vice chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, first spoke. Through some concrete examples, he examined himself because of the existence of strong bourgeois positions and views, resulting in many secession from the party leadership and actions that are detrimental to socialism. \\nRong yiren's review of his sympathy for Zhang Naiji's remarks has widened the contradiction between the Party and the business community. It is now sober.\\nRong yiren first examined his efforts at the Second Plenum of the Civil Construction Second Central Committee last year, when everyone and Zhang Yiji were struggling with issues such as the two sides of the national bourgeoisie, he was confused by the sectarian argument in the meeting put forward by Zhang Naiji, believing that he should be outside the matter, criticizing the chapter is in his heart. It would not be assumed that it was a physical attack. When several comrades of the Civil Construction struggle for unity, they invited him to speak with Zhang Naiji, Zhang also presented to them the absurd statement that 'the Chinese national bourgeois is the revolutionary class', while he said, 'China's national bourgeoisie has a revolutionary side and a non-revolutionary side.' He said that because he emphasized the patriotic side of the national bourgeoisie, and then from patriotic to affirm it 'love socialism', without knowing that there is no party education, without socialist transformation, the national bourgeoisie cannot love socialism. He said, 'My view shows that I have a strong bourgeois sentiment and bourgeois position, which stands in common with the chapter, so in that fight I have not only not been a help, but actually a resistance in the struggle'. \\nRong yiren went on to examine the incident that he raised in May this year at the publicity work meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), in May this year, the official representative of the Simingtang Pharmacy Bureau, He said that it was possible to raise this matter, but because his position was not correct, he exaggerated such individual issues and made big articles with small topics. He pointed out this under the broad principle that 'in order to promote democracy, we need to maintain law and discipline', and 'will' the First Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, Ke Qingshi and Deputy Mayor Xu Jianguo's 'army' asked them to deal with the issue immediately. He said: 'Because of my statement, it has had a very bad impact, widening the contradictions between the business and the party and the government, and in the effect is to help the business community 'upside down'. \\nRong Yijen also examined his personal bias, from personal favourites to combat business activists, and so on. \\nRong yiren went on to talk about his serious bourgeoisie feelings and positions, the right-wing elements Zhang Yijun had engaged in all kinds of competition and solicitation activities against him. \\nHe said that when Zhang Naiji visited Shanghai last year, he asked the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Civil Development Association to invite a symposium for him. Zhang Naiji made a lengthy reactionary speech at the meeting, encouraging the business community to 'look up', saying that the business and industry had not 'rise' after a joint venture in the whole industry. At that meeting, Zhang was also using the guise of opposing dogmatism and sectarianism to viciously stigmatize and attack the leadership of the Party, he wanted to put Shanghai, this private worker The city with the most concentrated business is caught in his hands as his 'political capital' to attack the party. Rong yiren said that Zhang Naiji's activity in Shanghai had found a 'market' to gain 'applause', leaving a very bad influence in the Shanghai business community, so that after a resolution was made at the Second Plenum of Civil Construction Central Committee on Zhang, the Shanghai business community did not pay attention to the discussion of this resolution. This. \\nRong yiren also revealed that when the National People's Committee of the People's Political Consultative Conference held a plenary committee in March this year, Zhang Naiji told him during the rest, 'The Second Plenary Session of the Civil Construction Second Central Committee should be re-evaluated and inspected.' One night during the meeting, Zhang Naiji first went to see Hu Zhuewen and then went to see him, and talked to him about the fixed price is not exploitation, but unproductive; both sides are present in all classes; rebirth is idealism, is 'extraordinary holy', 'cramping' and a series of fallacies. Rong yiren said, 'Why did Zhang Naiji ask me to talk about these issues at that time? Today it seems that he is looking for the market for his reactionary arguments, especially Hu Juewen and then to me. This shows that he is trying to find 'supporters' and 'passers-by' in the leadership of Shanghai, combining his criminal activities in Shanghai last year and his' lobbying ', which shows that he wants to lay the bottom and pull it up. Layer, grasp the upper layer and then develop the foundation, and the ultimate aim is to attack the party and socialism. \\nRong yiren said: 'Because of my strong bourgeois feelings, and Zhang Naiji have common ground, and also think he has learned and unwittingly helped him in his activities. I have talked several times with Comrade in charge of the Civil Construction Central Central Committee. He has' talented '. To unite him, I forgot that only on the basis of socialism Is it possible to unite and talk about unity with an anti-party or anti-people right-wing party? ' \\nRong yiren said: 'Now I am awake, I want to exercise myself resolutely in the anti-right struggle, thank the Party for drinking me at my dangerous juncture, so that I can wake up and not leave the socialist Kangzhuang Avenue.' Rong also expressed appreciation for the criticism and help of the Civil Construction and Commerce Federation. (1957.7.19)\\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached 5] The General Office of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee: 'Report to the Central Office of the Communist Party of China by telephone'\\nFirst, Rong yiren and Sheng Pi Hua and others. On the 27th, after the talks with Comrade Rong yiren and Rong yiren, Rong yiren and Liu Nianyi went to Rong's family on the 28th to talk. On the 29th, Rong and Yang Shuming, Deputy Secretary General of the Shanghai Federation of Commerce and Industry spoke, said he would examine from three aspects. First, from the beginning of the revelation to the climax of socialist transformation, the words and deeds at this stage. Rong said: To sum up the thoughts of eight years, this anti-right struggle is the Party's salvation for him. Second, check the style issue. Thirdly, there are several issues of relationship. He said: Zhang is not prepared to focus on the relationship, and is prepared to talk scattered in all aspects. On the issue of his relationship with Wang Junliang, he said: Wang is a two-sided faction, Wang has not spoken in front of him some words, some words Wang Junliang talked about, but he also has nothing to say. Look Rong means that he is reluctant to talk about Wang Junliang's issue. To Shing Kang, he said, 'They are familiar, and Sheng Kang has talked with him a lot.' He said: After he became deputy mayor of Shanghai, Sheng Kang asked him to communicate with various parties. For example, Ishisasan, in the medical profession, and Ma Lienliang from the literary and artistic world, will also go to professors, science and technology circles. Rong said: I do not want to do it, but I am not empty; if there is a spare, I have already done it. 'Think of it now, if you get up with them, the problem is even more serious,' he said. He said: the relationship with Sheng Pi Hua does not know how to talk about it, whether it is convenient to talk about it later (meaning fear of affecting the prestige of Sheng Pi Hua). Rong also asked Yang Shuming to find some people to help him check. He said: Most of the members of the CDC have spoken, and the rest are Chen Mingshan and Smokon did not talk. He said: People in the Standing Committee of the Federation of Commerce and Industry who have opinions about me and the director can invite them. He asked Yang Shu-ming to help him draw up a list for advice. He said: I don't want to come again this time for a second time, the party has given me a lot of help, I am not good to review again, the party is passive, I am also passive. He also requested that he be provided with a cadre to help him record and organize the material. \\nSpeaking to Liu Nianyi on the 28th, he said: My main problem is complacency. Liu Nianyi said: Your main thing is anti-party. Liu Nianyi went on to point out the Party's training of Rong since liberation. Liu Qirong said: Without the Communist Party, will there be you Rong yiren? Now you are not only a national figure, but also a world-famous figure. Liu asked him: Can you have today without the Communist Party? You shouldn't be anti-party. Hear here, Rong cried. Rong told Liu: to expose Shengkang years. Rong said: For two weeks, he could not sleep. Sometimes it was determined to expose, but thought that Sheng Kang years had helped him, did not expose; think again, want to expose again; but again think of the feelings of the same Sheng Kang year, you don't want to expose. Liu Nianyi believes: Rong's thought examination is not yet ripe. Liu said: In the struggle against Rong, the question must be raised very sharp, and the effect should be considered in the way. He said, 'It is better to ask Rong to speak first and then make his opinion, or he will let him touch the bottom.' He said: It is best to find Wu Zhongyi and Dong Chunfang. I also include, people ask each other questions, expose each other and critically expose each other, is the process of disintegrating small circles. He wants us to consider this way. \\nSheng Pi Hua had only a little new situation. After talking to him, he looked for his sixth son and his daughter-in-law for a meeting, and pointed out the seriousness of the issue in Sheng Kang Year. \\nIn addition, Liu Jingji said that his burden had been lost and ready to expose. Liu Jingji has done a lot of work to Prince Jian. Both Liu Jingji and Guo Dilive are preparing for inspection. \\nSecond, the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce set up the Wind Committee, chairman of Sheng Pi Hua, deputy chairman Hu Ziying, Sun Gengduo (Party member), Secretary-General Hu Ziying, Deputy Secretary-General Chen Mingshan, 17 members: Sheng Pi Hua, Hu Qiwen, Rong yiren, Guo Dihuo, Liu Jingji, Beard, Wang Xingyao, Tui Yanfang, Wei Ru, Smokang, Ye Baoshan, Tomtien, Du Dahung (Party Member), Sun More rudder (party members), Xiao Lin, Chen Mingshan, Ding Chen.

'As long as my head grows on me, I will report.' (Refers to the setting of fire and anti-party reports), The fire laid by Wen Hui Po at the Shanghai People's Art Theatre, Shanghai Beijing Opera Theatre, Shanghai Film Studio, Shanghai Science and Education Film Studio, almost all of the fire put by Rong zhengchang Zhengchang. \\nRong zhengchang Zhengchang set fire at the Shanghai People's Art Theatre before he set fire to the Beijing Opera Theatre. When finishing the speech at the Talent Arts Symposium, Rong zhengchang Zhengchang only chose the materials he 'liked' and deleted the words that comrades had made comments to the party in good faith. When publishing the minutes of the symposium, Rong zhengchang Zhengchang was also responsible for exerting pressure on comrades at the editorial department and party members, and must use the title of 'The Problem Here' to sing against the table with the title of the Liberation Daily, 'Where is the Problem'. Before Rong zhengchang Zhengchang went to science and film to set fire, deputy director of science and film, Wu Renzhi had told him: Zhao Guozhang was unhappy with the party, but Rong zhengchang Zhengchang did not listen to this advice, and he wanted to often go to Zhao Guozhang. Through Zhao Guozhang, he set fire to the science film and wrote a report that distorted the facts. In addition, Rong zhengchang Zhengchang also accepted the instructions of the right-wing elements Xu Zhucheng and Song Yunbin and went to Hangzhou twice to set fire. Rong zhengchang Zhengchang also attempted to set fire in Shanghai music circles and held a symposium in the music industry, but he did not publish because he suspected that the content of the symposium was 'not sharp enough.' After having put a few wildfires to write a lot of anti-party reports, Rong zhengchang Zhengchang said, 'I am ready to kill my head.' At the same time, a forgettable letter to the right-wing activist Fan Yan (Huan Bangxian), who is setting fire in Sichuan, said: 'Busy day and night, but the mood is very happy. Sold down the strength and engaged in some work, in Shanghai's humanistic arts, Beijing Opera Theatre, science and film, and put the fire away from bureaucratic sectarianism. I called this fire. You know what this is better than the jackpot is not below.' \\nRong zhengchang Zhengchang has always been hostile to the Party. He has been treating party members reporters working with him with a very brutal and even verbal attitude. Comrades responsible for other party members are often abusive and indiscriminately assaulted behind his back. To comrades close to the party, he hated. \\nAfter the anti-right struggle began, Rong zhengchang Zhengchang's attitude is still very bad. When Fan Yan just moved back from Sichuan to Shanghai to deal with the crime of setting fire, Rong zhengchang Zhengchang initially attempted to steal his letter to Fan Yan from Fan Yan's purse. He then entered into an alliance with Fan Yan, saying, 'We are not talking about the two letters.' At the same time, he also met twice with right-wing activists and reporter Liu Binyan of China Youth Daily to provide false information, falsely claiming that 'the Shanghai Municipal Committee's work was mess.' \\n'Wen Wei Po' party group had ordered Rong zhengchang Zhengchang to give an account, and had given a number of patient help. However, Rong zhengchang Zhengchang has been adhering to the party, asking him to consistently use the two-sided approach. In the interrogation, in an attempt to shirk responsibility. He described his anti-party conspiracy as an error in the general interview work, even in the face of a large number of unveiled facts, and finally blatantly defamated party members at the meeting and repudiated against the party. \\nRong zhengchang Zhengchang's negative and recalcitrant attitude caused the outrage of all comrades in Wen Wei Po. At the meeting, he was strongly criticized and rejected, and he was unanimously asked to bow down his head and make a thorough account. (Wen Wei Po, August 9, 1957)\\nPAGE 1"}

For example, Political Economics says that when independent workers rise to exploiters, the original funds are quickly spent and then won't work. Otherwise, the bourgeois of the Chinese nation, we do hard work, earn more and spend less, and after we rise to exploiters, we are not sitting and getting hard, but more laboring. Therefore, we learn Political Economics, and many places are not acceptable to listen and disbelieve.

Right now, the rise of the 'big magnification' is certainly the most noteworthy. Since 1955, it is not easy for people to dare to say so, and should be happy. Not to mention that the speakers' words are all true, the deficient, there are still a few points of swallowed and consumed, and this is a concern. It is the wise who is encouraged. Good medicine bitter for illness. Besides, the diagnosis and treatment of the three major principles is to pay a few pills, because the patient's condition is no longer light, and bureaucratic behavior is provoked by grievances. This is the truth. So why not ask a few more about this worrying fact. Why? Why did you ask the speaker why? And the fire was so great that both workers and farmers were also lifted out, and their lungs were said to blow up quickly. I would not believe it. Fabrication should also be a bit of logic, otherwise it will laugh generously. However, such negligence can be made to some people to see that the original intention of encouraging 'exoneration' came to light, what knows without saying, whatsoever is innocent, all false. And what is the purpose? Is it an increasing upgrade of the stick? How is it that means to flourish academic and creative? If so, China's fate would be truly sad. \\nI'm not Junjie, difficult to know the matter. This may be related to the bloody and arrogant bone of my year or so. While knowing that at this time, the consequences of knowing that sticks are still being put on, I am not afraid, and I have something to say, I think conscience and justice are more important than anything, than to live hypocritically, it is better to perish in real life. So, all I'm going to say is the truth. All I have to touch is sensitive topics, although partial and biased are inevitable, my attitude is sincere. I would only like to be an honest Komsomol member. \\nLet's say that the most fierce poisonous grass was hit 'party world, clear one'. I think it has its logical core in real life, synonymous with sectarianism, with the independent kingdom. For example, in our water conservancy hall, the three major incarnations can be lined up into a long list of teams, their flames like a layer of sorrow and misty, for a long time shrouded the youth's field of thought, so people can not move, otherwise, there are × flow of people jumping out, pointing to your nose tip, mouthless scolding: you dare Against me? You dare against Laozi? Do you dare opposition?! ... and in real life the 'generational party' and 'party generation' is precisely the refinement and extension of the 'party world' in this logic and tone, so that any party member can represent the party, even if the person is of very poor quality; so that any party organization at any level can directly exercise executive power, even if the A secretary is not the executive head of the department. \\nThis is the status quo of the Water Conservancy Department. Jin Jian, this second handle is a de facto handle, and the unnamed handle is in fact nothing, because he is an extra-party democracy and can only be used as a puppet, as a decoration. So it's absolutely true that people complained that they had no right to work, but I believe they had no power to compete for power, and people just had to look at what they paid for Vino would be enough. Now, people have a chance to complain about a few words and what? Isn't it just to keep the face of a little taxis? Poor, really poor, I am really ashamed of the weakness of Chinese intellectuals. If the above facts are limited to the water conservancy department, it is not enough to fully prove that the 'party world' has its reasonable kernel, because after all, our water conservancy hall has a hands-on decoration. What if you make a statistics, among the executive heads of the village and above find a few outside the party? Even if there are several, do they have the right to do it? I guess it may not be much better than the administration of the Water Resources Agency. This objective prescriptive nature is undoubtedly the driving force behind joining the party as officials. Therefore, it is inevitable that it becomes a reality in China today. And the disadvantages of this reality have a strong exclusivity, which is incompatible with democratic politics or political democracy, so that the election has become a primacy, and the people's congresses at all levels and the CPPCC have become rubber stamps. \\nCountry, for one party; party, for a monarch party. The Republic is still a dream for China. Is it possible to eradicate the trialism? Can social life still be normal?! Obviously, the rest of the life of Yun Yun is the only hope in Ming Jun. This is a shame for contemporary China. Let's ask, what should I do if the Jun is unknown? You can assert that it is terrible. The upper beam is not right down to the beam crooked, only the innocent should confess themselves to be \\nIsn't the text prison of 1955 a great proof?! It is not a joke or a joke on the basis of the personal letters of raided personal letters, and 'according to the words', you can arrest the winds into large jails and so on. What is the legal basis for the cure of ideology and sin? Where is the legal provision of 'internal counteraction'? Is it in a cruel and bloody historical precedent? If not, in any case, I will not be involved in such tragedies as well as my teens. As far as my young mind was concerned, when holy horror and abusive coercion, the heart of the sunflower sunflower was quickly forced into a real counter-revolution! Barely shame but just want to fight with death. This shows how many opposites will be drawn from the mistakes of policy and the barren rule of law, and how many innocent people will be destroyed, not the counter-revolution will also be forced into a counter-revolution! \\nI think it is not absurd that Liusha River said that 'half of the anti-war' movement 'half is a class struggle and half is a joke'. He is also too polite to say that it is completely joking, is joking about the political life of Chinese intellectuals. I hope this joke is not too big at the moment, or listen to the inverse words.

He was admitted to the Communist Party in 1940, has not yet been sworn in to organize life, lost organizational ties due to relocation, and rejoined the party in February 1942. Personal heroism is arrogant and arrogant, blows others, elevates themselves, poor democratic style, not careless, strict to people, not hard work, not deep, there is a serious bourgeois individualism, status and treatment. \\nI. Main reactionary words and deeds\\n1. Attacks on the general purchase and sales policy, she said: 'On the issue of general purchase of food, do not act according to policy, deceive the masses in chaos, forced orders to violate the law and discipline, and infringe the interests of the masses very seriously.' Stigmatization of the purchase is 'the district to carry out the process of expelling party membership, bundling, plunging buildings, etc.' or using 'dawn surrounded by dawn,' attacking the general purchase and sale, saying, 'causing a lot of people to be separated from their wives and their families are broken, many women and children are starving to death. Many women and children have become orphans and widows, many women and children have become orphans and widows. Children have so far been separated from their loved ones'. \\n2. Attacks Party committees at all levels and neglected the cadres responsible for the Party committees at all levels and the policy of defamating the Party cadre She said: 'The Central Provincial Committee on the province's starvation incident, summarizes the general summary that people died of starvation due to disaster, deserve further research and analysis.' 'The inspection of the dead man incident was reflected in the central government, only after the Central Committee sent people to check and deal with it. What are so many members of the Communist Party doing?' He also said: 'The large cadres went down to the platoon too large, really close to reaching out to the masses too few, playing more circles among the responsible cadres. It would be better than the old community's clearing officials to pretend to private visits.' He said that the provincial committee 'has no principle in implementing cadre policy', assaulting party committees at all levels that do not pay attention to women's work and provoke women cadres to dissatisfaction with the party. It was also said that women cadres do not work in the centre. \\n3. The leader of the All-China Women's Federation, speaking at the meeting of the directors of the Federation of Provinces and Municipalities last June, said, 'The big sister will not do big things, of course, will not make mistakes,' and said: 'The All-China Women's Federation is afraid of the phenomenon. It is the journalist who dared to speak.' \\n4. Attempts to release women's union organizations on top of the Party Committee. 'Women's federations must be representative and competitive, and only women's federations represent women's interests.' 'The Women's Federation should supervise and help the Party and Government properly implement food policy'. \\nII. Attitude in the struggle\\nThe initial attitude was extremely unhonest and, after many critical struggles, had finally largely acknowledged mistakes. \\nThird, the district party committee leading group finalization and treatment decision\\nShe was classified as a right-wing element, expelled from her party membership, revoked her position, introduced a retention check and reduced her treatment (from 13 to level 16).

In 1935, Wanyuan dyeing and weaving factory in Wuxi City as foreman, in November 1937, joined the Communist Party of China in March 1938, has served as a hoe rape officer, section chief, deputy minister of the military district defense department, deputy director of the provincial public security department, secretary general of the Northeast Political and Legal Committee. August 1954 to the present Attorney General of Liaoning Provincial People's Procuratorate (Party is a member of the provincial committee, alternate Standing Committee of the Provincial Supervision Commission, Party Secretary of the Provincial Procuratorate). \\nDuring the whole wind movement, the comrades revealed, and conducted investigations, confirmed that Nguyen Tuu has sanctuated and indulged anti-revolutionaries, anti-socialism and other crimes. Its main facts are as follows:\\n(i), Use of authority to shelter counter-revolutionaries. From 1950 to 1951, at the height of the first suppression of the counter-revolutionary movement, Nguyen Tu used his power as the director of the provincial public security department of liaoxi province to protect relatives, classmates and other anti-revolutionaries who fled from their hometown to escape the crackdown. NE currency nearly 20 million yuan. After they arrived in Jinzhou, these anti-revolutionary elements and fleeing landlords introduced their reactionary identities to Nguyen Tuu, but Nguyen Tu deliberately concealed them, and took seven counter-revolutionaries and one flee landlord, and privately introduced themselves to be placed within our factory mining agency, and some even became the chief of the cadre unit and correctional officer of the labor force. In 1952, after Nguyen Tu received a notification by the Tongling County Public Security Bureau to pursue these counter-revolutionaries, the information was concealed and continued to harbor it, causing great damage and extremely bad impact on the party and the state. It has been repeatedly reported over the years, and Nguyen Tu has always deceived the party. \\n(2), The leadership of the opposition party, opposes the proletarian dictatorship, tampering with the nature of the procuratorial office and reversing the case for anti-revolutionary elements Since serving as the Attorney General of the Liaoning Provincial Procuratorate, Nguyen Tu, from its reactionary position, has repeatedly used the name of communicating the instructions of the Central Committee and the Supreme Procuratorate to sell private goods and spread reactionary arguments. In 1956, he openly fabricated a rumor at a meeting of procuratorial cadres that: 'The Central Committee in charge of comrades instructed: the procuratorial office and the courts should protect the counter-revolution'. 'Before the court has ruled, it cannot be treated as counter-revolutionaries, cannot call criminals, and should call the defendant.' And he said: 'It cannot be thought that the Party Committee itself approves the final case will not be a problem, and it will be stuck at the juncture of the legal formalities through the procuratorate...' In 1957, he also fabricated: 'Today, the criminal nature has changed, because they are organized and basically belong to the people's internal problems. Therefore, in the future, no movement can be carried out to combat criminal crimes...' With these reactionary arguments, he has in fact tampered with the nature of the procuratorial authorities, vigorously directed the vigor of the procuratorial organs towards the inside of the people, trying to interfere in the operational activities of the public security organs, to restrain the hands and feet of the public security organs in their struggle against the enemy, and even to put the procuratorial organs in their struggle against the enemy. Above the party organization and oppose the party. \\nDuring his tenure as the final leader of the provincial committee's anti-5 group, Nguyen Tu also spread among the anti-revolutionary cadres several times: 'To protect the counter-revolution', 'anti-revolutionaries who have not been serious in history, have participated in our work for many years after liberation. Now they are against us.' and other reactionary arguments, trying to defend the counter-revolutionaries. On the basis of these reactionary arguments, in August 1956, in Fushun city, the 15 anti-revolutionaries and other bad elements that had been correctly settled in the city filed a turn over the case. In late December of the same year, in the absence of the full-time members of the final group of five members of the Provincial Committee's final group and involved in the finalization of the case, they used to carry out legal formalities to 'stop', and the eight counter-revolutionaries who had originally correctly approved the final case, and all reversed the case. \\nIn the summer of 1957, Nguyen Tu openly opposed the Provincial Committee's decision to carry out a campaign against criminal crime in 10 municipalities and criticism of the right leaning of the procuratorial authorities, and fabricated the facts and made false reports at the Supreme Procuratorate colloquium. After returning in June, he was able to tamper with the instructions of the Supreme Procuratorate and openly resist the provincial committee chambers, defaming and opposing the decisions and criticism of the provincial committee at a meeting of the provincial procurators' general procuratorates with their own reactionary views. In August of the same year, four plenary meetings of the Provincial Committee, had seriously criticized its mistakes. Nguyen Tujang lified the Provincial Committee for criticism of 'beating the water dog'. At the extended meeting of the provincial committee, which began in late June this year, many comrades made further criticism of their mistakes. Instead, Nguyen Tu made rumors in an attempt to retaliate against the comrades who actively expose his mistakes. After the extended meeting of the Provincial Committee, and after the provincial political and law coalition party group expansion meeting and this Provincial Committee plenary meeting, further criticized its mistakes patiently and seriously. Nguyen Tu has always been unreasonable. In the face of a large number of facts, the attitude is very bad and has no repentance. \\nAccording to the above facts, it fully demonstrates that Nguyen Tu is a bad and right-wing element who has long been mixed with the party and steal important posts. In order to clean the organization of the Party and serious discipline of the Party, after the plenary meeting of the Provincial Committee decided to dismiss its party membership, and recommended that the relevant organs be removed from all their posts outside the party. \\n[Compilation of Decisions on Purging the Right in the Party (4), Executive Office of the Central Committee of the CPC Central Committee, December 1959]\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"}

From 2:00 to 7:00, no rest, non-stop, full 5 hours of continuous axis teaching (in addition to the bathroom), the more excited the teacher Ruan wei Wei, the more excited, the more we hear. Through one-way flow and two-way interaction in lectures, Q&A, questions, communication, etc., it seems that we have moved from the 'childish class' of speech to the 'elementary school' at once. \\nMr. Nguyen Wei's speech monograph is expected to be published around the end of 2010. Both Teacher Xiao Feng and my Nguyen Mun alumni will be published. \\nLinguistics, in the world, in Humboldt, Germany, and Sosul, Switzerland, two linguists. In China, Ruan wei Wei from Shanghai Chinese. \\nLinguistics, elegant if the sun is snow, but not the high of the treasure of the deep mountain; speech, easy to look like the people of the riba, but is the whole sea of insight. Speechology, which allows you to walk the dragon snake; verbal, will make you mouth lotus. Speech science, like alpine flowing water-trickle and silent; speech science, like the canghai frenzy-giant lan in the sea. Speechology is shining, will finally be a history of piety. Contemporary Chinese people rekindle the giant candle of Chinese culture, and then the glory of candlelight! \\nRoad smooth moss, lightning thunder, stumbling, bumpy. After the mad biao, the wind and Rili, teacher Ruan wei Wei on 'speech science' and research have entered a new era! \\nSince the 'confidence' force and self-' deceiving' force, although the difference between the word, is indeed a distance from miles. This is the difference between old and new ideas, this is the difference between good and evil life, and this is the difference between truth and falsehood. Since ancient times, the hard-working and brave Chinese nation has no shortage of 'bones' and 'ridges'; since ancient times, we in China have hard-working people, there are people who work hard and hard to do... 5,000 years of ancient civilization, there are so-called 'positive history' and 'general history', as well as so-called 'wild history' and 'secret history' Flawless, paper does not contain fire: gold, will always shine a brilliant light; is the ridge, will always support a strong body stand. To discuss whether the Chinese people are confident or not, the articles of the predators are not sufficient. The words of the immortal emperor are not enough to believe. We need to go to see the world, see people, see grassroots, and see people. And Professor Nguyen Wei is one of the best-after the world's sentiment, the world's vicissitudes, but he is indomitable, not inferior; courageous, perseverable; satisfied, confidence hundred times. Documentary linguistics creates this phenomenon, Nguyen Wei's self-confidence has long been, and has already been able to have it. With the wisdom and wisdom of the Chinese people, and the ability and way of the Orientals, he has set up a broad new world in the field of 'speech'. \\nSpeech semantics refers to the specific contextual meaning generated by people in the use of language, it is not only specific, but also flexible, often influenced by the social context or context, or temporarily adding some new language color. 'Speech' and 'Language' Jing Wei is clear, the difference is clear. Speechology is broad and deep, pregnant. 'Speech' covers 'language', and 'language' is only one of the organic components of 'speech.' In the past, the 'misleading' of the so-called 'linguistics' is actually the 'misreading' and 'wrong' in the translation business of 'translation' by introducing the concept of advanced scientific culture in foreign countries. The essence is a kind of 'Zhang Guan Li Dai' type of misalignment. For a long time, fill in duck teaching, foolish indoctrination, misinformation, will be wrong, agreed, mistaken so far, the flow is widespread, difficult to return. As for the relationship between 'speech' and 'language', there is a better ratio: linguistics, as if it was a complete building, language, like building materials such as sand, stone, earth, wood, cement, etc. \\nIn the 1960s, the author had listened to Ruan wei Shi Chinese; 70-80's, Chinese linguistics flickering in Nguyen's Cheats. In the 21st century, I and my compatriots Lixue Ruan wei's door, traced from Chinese 'Han' studies, looking for 'verbal' in the world, on the sword in 'Lu' learn 'Jin' learning 'Xu'. Linguistics, dazzling; Linguistics, beautiful. Chinese linguistics, like the shining light on the horizon of the East, showcasing its infinite and powerful vitality. Chinese people, such as Phoenix Nirvana, fly their wings; if the dragon is empty, soar nine days. Once you enter the Hall of Speechology, you will surely have the awakening of Mauceton, the delights of Daigo, the aftertaste of the feast and even the spring breeze of mouth. \\nRuan wei Wei, 'pioneer' of speech science in China;\\nRuan wei Wei, a professor in Shanghai of Wangba Gao Shou;\\nRuan wei Wei, an education expert who learns about five cars;\\nRuan wei Wei, a research scholar who is very high in Badou;\\nNguyen Wei, a 'alternative' legend;\\nNguyen Wei, give me a mentor who preached his profession. \\nChang Ming of science belongs to the Chinese with a unique amount of thinking! \\nThe future of the nation depends on the Chinese people with abundant wisdom! \\nThe fate of mankind needs Chinese to be flexible and creative! \\nThe future of the world depends on Chinese people with firm confidence! \\nProf. Wei Ruan wei, TaiZhou, Zhejiang. His life was bumpy, tribulation and legendary. In 1957, Ruan wei Wei, who was an assistant professor at East China Normal University in Shanghai, was seized with the 'right' hat on the charge of 'nothing to do'. \\nSince then, he was disqualified as 'teaching' and fell into the abyss of darkness and doom. However, the bias of 'bone' and 'ridge' appear in sinking: doom, often a double-edged sword; misery is often a textbook. Nguyen Wei, he rose up from adversity-since then, it was a cone and green light cold night, he tirelessly, day and night began his life's energy and effort to explore the 'speech science', discourse and research, finally in the teaching practice after the 'see the day' Big or even unique. His N students received high titles in education with the unique charm of 'Speech'. Nguyen Wei, known as the 'ancestor' of Chinese linguistics. \\nProf. Nguyen Wei's insightful insight on the use and even continuation of 'speech science' has attracted the attention of the teaching community in the country: he speaks at academic conferences, he published articles in academic journals, he reversed the findings of 'linguistics', and he has received eye-catching attention. \\nRuan wei Weiqi has been introduced and publicized in the titles of 'Biographical Biographies of Chinese Experts', 'Chinese Expert Talent Library' (Scientific Chinese Book Series), the Dictionary of Chinese Experts and Scholars, and the Chinese Expert Names Dictionary. \\nRuan wei Wei has taught at East China Normal University, Shanghai Guanghua School, Shanghai Foreign Language Vocational School, Shanghai Putuo District Amateur University and Shanghai Second Polytechnic University. \\nAfter the Cultural Revolution, Shanghai East China Normal University had intentionally attracted Ruan wei Wei back to his 'alma mater' to continue teaching; however, Ruan wei Wei Yuan refused: because it was a 'sad' to put on him a 'right' hat, and it was difficult to look back!"}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】Zhou Lei: 'Writing and writing Spring and Autumn-Visit Professor Ruan wentao from Shandong Academy of Arts' (2017.4.7)\\nLate-autumn day, we drove to Shandong Academy of Arts to interview Professor Ruan wentao, a renowned theatrical critic in our province. Upon meeting, the reporter was impressed by the very affinity of scholar temperament revealed in Nguyen Lao. Ruan Lao is 70 years old this year. He is a member of the China Confucius Institute Editorial Board, Director of China Shakespeare Society, Executive Vice President of Shandong Society of Ethnic Culture, Director of Shandong Theatrical Critics Association and member of Shandong Science and Culture Committee of the NLD.. \\nNguyen Wentao is a highly reputable critic in theatre and abroad, not only because of his unique insight into the development of theatrical arts, but also because he shares the same troubled fate of many of the first generation of new Chinese intellectuals. \\nIn 1931, Nguyen Wentao was born in Feicheng Old Town Dongguan Village. From his childhood, he had accepted the progressive ideas of the revolution and was determined to follow the path of revolution. In February 1949, he joined many patriotic youths to join the ranks of the revolutionary ranks. The majestic March of the Fortune, which drove his hearts and downs, the passionate lyrics deeply subdued him. Tian Han, the word author and famous theatrical literary of the Younger Army March, became an idol in his mind since childhood. Tian Han's theatrical poetry became his beloved text. The revolutionary arts in the liberated area attracted and strengthened his volunteer to engage in revolutionary arts and art, and soon he became a revolutionary literary warrior at the East China University Cultural Corps. Soon, he was sent to the Department of Art of Shandong University and Shanghai Drama Academy specializing in theatrical literature, and became the house disciple of famous theatrist Professor Li Jianwu. From the Cultural Works Corps to the University, Nguyen Wentao became the first batch of new Chinese college students trained by the Party, thus allowing him to undergo strict systematic training on the basis of more rich literary and artistic practices and gained theoretical sublimation. \\n'At that time there were only two or three students in one class, the whole department was less than 20 students and three classes, but professors were very well established teachers in theatrical history. Dean Xiong Foshi is the founder of the Chinese drama industry and director Li Jianwu taught me directly. He is a prominent person in theatrical history, a creator and theorist. There are also Zhao Mingyi and Zhang Junchuan. These professors are very prestigious teachers in the theatre world. I'm lucky. In front of them, I taught hands-on, because I learned from the old quarter as a revolutionary cadre who took me seriously in all aspects of teaching. The Academy of Drama has laid a solid foundation for my future business expertise in these two years. \\nAfter graduating in 1954, Nguyen Wentao was assigned to the Association of Chinese Theatrical Artists, chaired by Tian Han, founder of the revolutionary drama movement in China. He has served as editor and journalist of the only authoritative drama publication in the country, the drama newspaper. In the late 1950s, it coincided with the inauguration of New China's national opera drama repertoire in Beijing. As editor, journalist and literary critic of the Drama newspaper, he was passionately engaged in interviewing and organizing and editing a great deal of news coverage on drama creation and performance. \\n'When the journalist was 22 years old, when vigorous. Our country was also the best period at that time. Besides now, before the Cultural Revolution was the best period, the Party's policy was very open. After the opening of the Party's 'Eight Congress', it called for economic construction. As for me, it's hard to work.' \\nDuring his time as a reporter of the Drama newspaper, Nguyen Wentao's dialogue drama 'Wan Shui Qianshan' and Kunqu's Fifteen Five Chuan made positive contributions, writing, organizing and photographing, promoting the publicity of the two plays. While writing a large number of theatrical news reports, he also actively explored drama art, especially theoretical research on the aesthetics of realism, and published one in newspapers such as Wen Wei Bao, Drama, Beijing Daily, Xinmin and China Youth Daily. Series of theatrical review articles. The traditional and innovative features of drama art and the aesthetic features of drama arts, such as 'Talking about the beauty of the motherland', 'Talking about ugly drama', 'Talking about the ugly opera', 'Shandong Opera', and so on. Creation of playwright and performers with great encouragement. \\nJust as Nguyen Wentao was full of the spirit of patriotic return to the country, when he showed up in theatrical and literary circles, the disaster unfortunately came to his head. In 1957, under the party's big call, he was appointed by the organization in the theatrical newspaper to publish 'Tianjin Drama Circles Rounded Chunlei' and 'Appeal for Stage Artists' two texts shaking the theatrical world at that time, calling for 'need a different genre' and called for 'to open up different gardens' The limitations on the freedom of creation and the infringement of the right to create the art of stage art' criticize... His passion for insight and dedication made him the first person to be criticized and misclassified as the right in the Chinese theatrical association. Since then he was forced to hold his pen for more than twenty years. \\n'The wind of the 1957 party was a part of the immense look back. At that time, I was the first right-wing in the Wenlian Building to be pulled out. The first groups of the right to be dealt with by the central authorities in Beijing were more serious, with expulsion, re-education through labor, and a train pulled to Beida deserted. \\nJuly 13, 1957, was an unforgettable day for Nguyen Wentao. On this day, he is about to enter the sacred temple of marriage. However, during this day's editorial office meeting, his work was criticized. Mountain rain wants to come full of wind, anti-right struggle has quietly struck to Ruan wentao. \\n'There was a critical meeting on the afternoon of marriage, but did not refer to my name, referring to the article. Originally wanted to celebrate the celebration. At that time the political climate changed, they were not dare, nor did it feel. The bride was waiting for me downstairs. After the meeting, I had a meal and returned to the new house. At that time, Tanhan's secretary Lai no hiko ran in a hurry. He said that Tian Lao Gang knew you were going to marry, took a book, signed the name and let it be sent. I was moved. When many people wanted to clear my boundaries, Tian Lao gave gifts to congratulate me on getting married. Married on Saturday, returned to her mother's home on Sunday, and a big print came out on Monday. After some time, when the mass assembly was opened for criticism, Tian Han presided over a critical assembly, and the first one pulled me out. At that time, it was not a taste. When criticizing in the countryside, I became Tian Han's minion again, knowing that it was Tian Han's secretary, and I could not justify it.' \\nEndless criticism until dismissal from public office, re-education through labor. At the most tragic time of life, Nguyen Wentao's first wife left him. A series of blows did not defeat the strong Nguyen Wentao, after four years of labor education, health and death. In June 1962, he returned to his hometown Feicheng. \\n'After four years of re-education through labour, return to Feicheng. After more than a dozen years in the countryside wearing a hat, no one discriminated against me and took care of all aspects. These poor farmers, their view is, what bad can a Communist Party trained college student do? Very simple feelings, it is not clear. On May 1, 1978, Hu Yaobang presided over the work after the unification picking hat, comrades from Feicheng Cultural Center invited me to say you come to do some work. The first is to organize amateur writing teams, help them write paragraphs, write songs, write words, write operas; the second is to organize creative training courses, at the time organized various communes lovers of literary activities training, preparing for the County Literary Show. A series of activities can be said to be a reward before I left.' \\nIn February 1979, when Ruan wentao entered the 30th anniversary of the revolution, the party group of the Chinese Theatricians Association officially pitted him back and resumed his work. He also invested with great enthusiasm and thoughtful thinking in the new era of drama. This year, he participated in the preparations for the memorial service for Tian Han Ping, and hosted the organization of propaganda for Tian Han Zhaoxue. \\n'After the rehabilitation, the first job arranged in the organization was to prepare a memorial service for Tian Lao. He said you don't think that the memorial service was opened for a person in Tian Lao, this is a praise for the whole literary world. The first thing that the Cultural Revolution opened fire was Tian Han. Now, the rehabilitation or first to Tian Han, it means the entire literary and artistic community. \\nIn September 1979, at his own request, Ruan wentao moved to the Department of Drama, Shandong Academy of Arts, has participated in the founding journal 'Qilu Yiyuan' and served as deputy editor, presided over the founding of the Shandong Institute of Art as deputy editor, was hired as consultant, professor, Shandong Institute of Modern Art Visiting professor and invited editorial committee of 'Chinese character speech sea'. In the 80s, while teaching and running the press, he worked on the research of the new decade of drama and western modernist drama, with a view to breaking down the theoretical dilemma. In his long paper on 'Truth Tested by History', he confirmed the truth enunciated by Comrade Mao Zedong's Speech at the Yan'an Literary Symposium 40 years ago with the success and failure of 80 years of Chinese drama, and proves to escape from what appeared in previous years Theatrical 'Crisis' Way. This article was awarded the 'International Outstanding Papers Award' by the World Culture and Arts Research Center of the World Chinese Exchange Association and the first prize by the Jury of China's Great Culture Monographs. The article 'Burial Old Times with a smile' was included in the World Academic Library (Chinese volume), and won the gold medal. Its legend was published by the List of Chinese Contemporary Art Professions, Chinese Characters Citing the Sea, China International Celebrity Resignation, the National Review List of Universities, and the Dictionary of Chinese Contemporary Writers. On the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Ruan wentao won the Medal 'dedicated to the founder of the Republic'. \\nIn previous years, theatrical circles talk about the drama 'crisis' while touting the wind. Nguyen Wentao is not only an open mind, but its style is also not worldly. In the 1950s and 1980s, none of the more than 400,000 words of documents published in the 1950s and 80s, none of them should be made. \\nNguyen Lao has devoted his life to the study of drama, and has a deep competence in this area. In people's impressions, drama such as drama has been far away from people's lives, and how drama can enter people's lives faster and deeper, Professor Nguyen Wentao has a very unique insight:\\n'To stick to the realism of the creation. Realism is to capture, collect, experience life from life, and then reflect real life on the stage. For example, the 'Sultan and Emperor' play took a lot of money, but it distorted our ancestors. I wrote in an article that some people now don't catch the subject and don't know what the theme is.' \\nProfessor Nguyen Wentao is a member of the NLD. Although he is now left home, he has a lot of part-time jobs. He usually actively participates in various social activities as long as he has the opportunity to play his own legacy for the construction of all social causes. In Nguyen Lao's recently published personal book 'Stigma', there are several such small essays, 'Songs and Dances, Speaking from a Evening Party', 'Two Letters to CCTV', and so on, it can be seen that he is very concerned about many small social phenomena. \\n'I say it's an occupational disease, maybe not good, should be said to be a professional feature. People say I'm a literary critic and critic. As a profession, like a cold view of the world, like prick, such as speaking not in accordance with grammar, I want to correct it. At the time of the National Day, we said about the 50th birthday of the motherland, how to explain this motherland, what the motherland means. The People's Republic of China is the motherland. Now she represents the motherland, but she is not the history of our motherland. We all say that the motherland has five thousand years of civilization history, the Republic's fifty years of history. This is right, and it is easy to get political problems after the concept is confused. I watch TV or go out, see these things, always find something wrong.' \\nAt the end of the interview, the elderly Nguyen Wentao expressed good wishes for their hometown through the microphone in the hands of the reporter. \\n'I said that I do not forget my father and folks, because from my childhood to the time of my disaster, the love that my father folks gave me to survive, I had today. So, I often miss my hometown and want to go back and see. I am happy to hear the huge changes in my hometown constantly. I also hope that Feicheng will have greater development, and the conditions are better.' \\nAt the end of the interview, the old man showed an unwilling look. Our interview car started, and Nguyen Wentao old man and wife Qian Xuemin still stood downstairs and waved at us. At this time, we have a wish in our hearts, that is to wish Nguyen Lao good health, happiness in old age...\\n(Zhou Lei)"}

However, for the promotion and promotion of Peking Opera, please keep your mind. \\nI sincerely hope you can dedicate your treasures of Peking Opera for nearly 25 years to the country-the eight classic Wu drama famous drama [eight wax temple' [Nafedegong] 'Maozhou Temple' [Naxie Tiger] 'Dongchangfu' [Na Xie Tiger] 'Huai'an Province' Cai Tianhua] 'Overlord' [Take Huang Longji] 'One Tiger Camp' [Narro Four Tigers] Yin Jiabao [Na Yin Hong] 'Lok Ma Lake' [Take Li Pei]. However, as far as I estimate, such as: 'Chain Set' [Natur Pier] 'Brook Emperor' [Nahua Drei] 'River Stream House' [Na Hao Wen Monk] these famous [eight small take] plays may also be recorded orally. \\nYes, Peking Opera once became a kind of 'victim' for Mao Zedong's political needs. After many calamities, although nine lives were dead and destroyed, the degree of destruction was shocking. A large number of Chinese opera's greatest and most outstanding masters and famous opera artists in the history of Chinese opera have suffered doom in political movements. Such as: Li Wanchun, Ma Lianliang, Tang Yunsheng, Zhou Xinfang, Xun Huisheng, Huang Guiqiu, Xi Xiaobo, Li Huiliang, Ye Shenglan, Gai Cam Tian, Xiao Cuihua, Li Shaochun, Yan Huizhu, Tong Zhiling, Qiu Shengrong, Ye Shengzhang, Mao Shilai, Chen Yongling, Xu Hanying, Gao Bai Ye, Jinkai Chen, Changlin, Ru yuanjun, Xiao Shengchun, Wang Xiaofang, Jin Suwen, Li Baokui, Ye Shengchang, Li Xiaochun, etc., etc., Innumerable, they have become 'victims' of this kind of political need, falling, sick, maimed, dead, dead and destroyed. \\nSpring thunder, earth recovery, dead wood spring, Vientiane update, Fortunately Deng Xiaoping, Peking opera side began to be saved, spring dead wood, and also met Gan Lin, a new generation of state leaders Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Ding Guan Gen, Zhang Bai Fa, Jiang Zemin, Wanguoquan, Wang Guangying and others, vigorously supported today. \\nNowadays, the latest generation of state leaders Hu Jintao, Wen Jiabao and others have also vigorously promoted national culture. They have already been set as State policy, passing on the fire, and long. \\nAdmittedly, these artists are the most conscientious people's artists, and are all models of the protection of Beijing opera and heroes to defend the quintessence of the nation! \\nWu Sheng Taidou Li Wanchun, is a friendly, enthusiastic, cheerful, humorous and optimistic, dedicated his life to the cause of Peking Opera artists, but unfortunately all sorts of doom. \\n25 years ago, the elderly on the eve of illness, although there are still 'two horses and one Li' residual palpitation [Note 1], although indeed 'taking a certain risk' [Note 2], he still decided to secretly dictate 'eight taana', made a box belt, for the cause of Peking Opera made the final, also extremely exciting Sour touching and nostalgic a contribution of great artistic value! \\nThis old man, despite the artistic oppression, life blows, political persecution, physical and psychological devastation imposed on him by a few 'politicians' who have been mixed with the leadership of Beijing Opera for decades. Dying, or thinking about Peking Opera, he is one of the many artists in the peking opera world truly deserved to 'dedicate' these four golden characters, this is the senior and learning model that every Peking opera person should respect! \\nQianqiu sin, own people commented that the people are the best witness, practice is the standard for testing the truth, history is the best iron proof! \\nSincerely hope the country, can give Li Wanchun, the top figure of the Peking Opera industry to re-name, but also its name with a sounding name! \\nNowadays, Deng Xiaoping, Li Ruihuan and Ding Guan Gen have completed and are completing a 'three-step song' to save the Peking Opera. \\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Note 1] 'Two Horse One Li'-'Two Horse' refers to Ma Shaobo and Ma Yanxiang. At that time, the former served as the President of the Beijing Beijing Opera Theatre of China, succeeded the Deputy Minister of Culture of the People's Republic of China, and the latter served as Director of the Arts Department of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China. Both were historical sinners who collapsed Peking Opera, destroying Peking Opera, and destroying Peking Opera. Ma Yanxiang, who once advocated Peking Opera to 'cancel Facebook, cancel the mouth', the 'reason' was 'people in life, there was no such 'colorful' face ', nor such a' beard 'long in the air.' It is time that Lu Xun is known as 'four men' Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, Tian Han, Yang Han Sheng and other manpower protection. If not, China had no real Peking Opera as early as the 50s! Can Peking Opera Facebook still have a reputation overseas to promote international cultural exchange to promote world trade to improve national authority? As a result, Ma Shaobo, last year also wrote to advocate that the singer drama 'Grand Baogo · Tengwang Tomb · Binary Palace' was overthrown by the whole, and the reason was that 'the full drama is the same as the two yellow singing chambers.' Bad, sing in the end, for more than two hours, singing endless, untasteless, not to reflect this is a 'The complex, intense struggle of the palace,' advocates a re-adaptation, 'abandon these singing' and writing 'a new historical drama depicting the intricacies of the palace struggles.' These two people, fortunately, one died, one is no longer a 'leader' who is 'always right, always wise, always great, forever brilliant'! Otherwise, Peking Opera must be completely and completely finished! 'One Li' refers to Li Hezeng, his art, Zongzong's high school, to be realistic and honest, good taste, indeed good, should be true affirmation; but his people, who are purely 'politicians', despicable, dangerous and spicy, should be faithfully rejected. (If you don't believe it, you can ask Mr. Zhang Chunhua, as long as Zhang Lao dare to say, there must be an amazing answer.), The three people, 'two horses and one Li', are all persecuted Li Wanchun, Ye Shenglan, Xi Xiaobo, Ru yuanjun, Chen Yongling, and so on, have become 'hero' of the 'great right'. The three people have also persecuted many other names. Home. It is the year, Ma Lianliang, Yuan Shihai, Zhang Chunhua three people in danger of poisonous hands, are all clever around, Fang began 'the rest of the life'. Li Wanchun first called 'two horses and one Li'. It is known to all over the world. I now call it. \\n[Note 2] 'Risking a certain risk'-At a time when the director of the Beijing Opera is Zhang Menggeng. He is also a 'far left' person who arbitrarily destroyed Peking Opera. After crushing the 'Gang of Four' and Deng Xiaoping's 'chaotic anyway', Li Wanchun will actually be 'far left' hard on Li Wan after crushing the 'gang of four'.

Teacher Ran is a good teacher elected by Chairman Mao...' This statement scares him dizzy and darkened, and caused some people discontent. Shortly summarize his work to the Central Committee, rated as 'excellent educator'. Speech at the Ministry of Education, making mountain schools famous throughout the country, and Northeastern Normal University (his alma mater), has also filed for the school to train outstanding students, excellent workers after graduation. \\nIn order to take care of ethnic minorities, the University has come to many people, and one has gone, leaving only an old and honest man like my father who is straightforward, who only knows to work hard and cannot adapt to the complex environment. Hemorrhoids, standing and painting, more sick, hospitals have never seen such serious illness refused, by Yang director, admitted to the hospital, fell a serious illness (hemorrhoids, insomnia as the heaviest), life-long, painful. \\nLeaders at all levels have repeatedly recognized, and some people are particularly dissatisfied, and they believe that honour belongs to them. The father submitted to the name of the school or the principal, after evaluating his salary, asking for a downgrade, some people said: 'Be wise, reduce hatred.' Leaders are not satisfied. White Flag often asked him to talk about some construction issues, and the leadership was very dissatisfied. \\nWhen the two people went to Renmin University of China in Beijing to find Professor Jia Yan to prepare to fabricate information and come back to commit a crime. Who knows Ja said: 'Responsible for the party, that's the truth.' The two people were dissatisfied, filmed outrage, expelled by the university watching. The University also wrote to Inner Mongolia Secretary Kuibi: 'Strictly punish the culprit of the office of Renmin University of China.' As a result, the principal did not write and check once again... how to report this hate, and increase greater disaster. \\nAgainst the right, several people discussed: 'Director Yang made Ran order accustomed to heaven, forgot all of our leaders, don't see outsiders too high, award him a grant. I advised the director not to listen many times.' 'For the first time I saw such high rewards, honorary awards were more glorious than money. Alas! Wang Meng also looked at him specifically, that doesn't work.' Some people said: 'Ran's outstanding achievements, led to leaders from all sides, so that the whole country knows my school is good, and the leadership is equally honorable.' The leader said, 'Never, we do not have soft hands, first crack down on his prestige in all school teachers and students, and try to break him down.' \\nMy father did not want to hear an indoor noisy. Jiang Qiulan said: 'Why don't you criticize people who are not hard at work, are not high, and only say good obedient? Specializing in the fight against the work of good, achievements, and the prestige of the masses, always have nothing to do with him?' The leader said: 'He does not work well, looks down on people, you check what attitude!' Jiang said: 'You treat comrades like this, you can bring the masses back to heart.' Pat the table, 'newspaper look'. Jiang gave him an unevenness, and he was a great head. \\nBig sister sent to high school in his hometown, Wangfu middle school sent a letter 'not allowed to record and not be allowed to go to any high school.' \\nThe Department of Education forced his father to submit, and soon all the text was returned and attached to the statement 'Your draft has been typesetted, because you are not allowed to publish your letter, I'm sorry.' \\nThe principal sent a person to move next door to him, saying that he was the head of the secret service and also named him. Someone said he had participated in my father's secret meetings many times, and those letters came from his hands, and was young and did something not to do. Some people think that he went to desolate places thousands of miles away, with heavy work without complaints, making countless teaching aids, studying nature, meteorology, geology, archaeology, and doing a lot of good things to the place. This work attitude is too abnormal, of course not good people. The father said: 'He was a teenager to participate in the underground party, and he was voluntarily enrolled, only trying to realize his promise, did not consider the gains and losses, heard that her daughter was begging at home, without moving heart to work, and went home twice in eight years.' \\nFormulation in the former Rehe Province was abolished, Kaki was under the control of Inner Mongolia, and Yang's director was left as local commissioners without the support of the original leadership. Local forces were not as good as opposed by greater power, and my father and some people were more persecuted. \\nHe was finally classified as a right-wing prison in 1958 for five years. The Public Security Secretary shouted: 'Give the pistol, radio, bomb!' All research materials, papers, prizes, Li Qingzhao, Li Baishi and Li Baishi have no idea where to go. On the indictment, there was 'little evil and would not have been punished for a vicious attack on the cadre of the revolution'. Malevolent without content, predicting the success of defsting, saving hundreds of thousands of pounds of food from loss across the flag. Some people believe it is evil and vicious attack on the cadres of the revolution. At the beginning of the small weather station (eight years earlier than the flag station), accumulated a lot of information for the local production and life, this is the fact of iron. The father heard the opening of the meeting: 'Do not hesitate to make a sense of knowledge, he paid the region first and said difficulties, praised him in all respects, so that he looked down on us.' On the escort road, the father saw a piece of calcite on the ground, bent over and picked up, and the soldiers said, 'When research science has broken the law!' He understood that he was a prisoner. \\nMy father lived in two types of jail, arrested by the Communist Party in 1943, and in 1958 he was also imprisoned by the Kuomintang. \\nIn 1958, big sister was admitted to Luoyang mining technology school, three years graduated as a technician. After a year notice, you can not go to school, work out of the workshop, two years notice can not be when the worker is devolved home. The second sister rose to junior high school, scored first in the county, can only go to agriculture, less labor and study, soon discontinued, 13-year-old young girls serve as male labor, uphill peaked bark breadwinners, all meals are bark, and cannot survive under unprovoked oppression by cadres. Since then, all four of my sisters were evicted from school. \\nReleased from home in 1963, which should not have been regulated, the night was notified of the opening of four classes of molecules, all day and a group of bad elements 'reforming'. Hard labourers, slaves, dangerous workers, and voluntary workers all need him. It has been subjected to brutality, abuse, and prison by local cadres, and by human hell for twenty years. \\nSend letters, snow night into the mountains, snow white, can not see the rugged mountain road, fall many times, legs bleeding, more than twenty miles walk seven, eight hours, the day arrived. Book wrath: 'It woke me up, bastard get away!'. Twenty miles away Longtangou sent a letter. Here the book Qu Huanzhang said: 'You are the political movement back, you have worked for the revolution in the past!' \\nRepair the power station, let his 60-year-old man with eight youths to dry, and the next day is seriously ill ten days. For several years, the power plant was built to celebrate, banquet guests, commanded him to transport stones in the water. Under the cliff, his life is in danger at any time, others change, he goes from start to finish. In winter work on the river beach, he slept at night to see tools, no bedding, clothes and tattered, sleepless overnight in a bunch of weeds. Open water, hard to dry for two and a half years, he could not bear the loss of public property, risked: 'Here is the igneous rock do not have to build.' Book wrath: 'Our dictatorship called igneous rocks become slag (water rock), our cadres are smart, the world knows, you are not allowed to speak!' \\nCommune expansion, secretary Zhang used poison to deceive my father was severely beaten, tooth knocked 3. Take my home without spending a penny. \\nHis father was seriously ill, the local language called 'long worm' that grew up in the waist, and died after a week. No money to heal, the mother used a broken bowl slices often cut the two ends of the affected area, not let the connection, and die at risk. \\nEvery day compulsory street sweeping, snow. Perennial hungry, one year said a harvest, my family points 32 pounds of food. Another year break, two sister sold blood remittance 10 yuan. Before the Spring Festival, I went with my mother to borrow food, I used the sleeves as a bag and borrowed a few pounds of wheat I was happy to think I could eat dumplings in the first place. Often wild vegetables as the staple food, all the leaves are not bitter for food, year old to know the meat taste. \\nCultural Revolution, classes are held at all levels, and the famous day 'Mao Zedong Thought Class' is to not believe in the concentration of education and the ugly history. The brigade came out into the commune, the foreign agent first asked. Investigate his classmate Wang Dong (Wang in Chuandang County Governor), talking, the secretary said: 'Ran is the bad guy can not prove the revolutionary cadre.' In the afternoon, he said: 'You knew you were the Communist Party, quickly give clear account of the activities! Proving that Jin Jianfeng was a counter-revolution. After signing it, he was severely beaten without signing. The two military personnel moved out, beaten a meal first, several days later they knew it was to investigate Luo Xingzhou. County classes were more brutal, and my father was here for four and a half months, often breaking food. \\nBad guys wear a cuff on his arm saying: 'I am a landlord' or 'historical counter-revolution', stipulating that people who do not know know must answer, I am a landlord. His father hung historical counter-revolutionary signs, wearing shorts around the street and nearby villages. The people of the revolution declared every sin and said, 'We revolutionaries save you, and you dare to say that we are not literate. The underground party, we poor farmers still dare not to participate, Ran said dare to participate in the underground party, have also entered jail, sin is even greater.' Somehow, cadres hated bone marrow for those who participated in the early revolution, and went to death. I often shouted my parents' names in the middle of the night, meeting, fighting people and other emergency collection, scared me all over the shiver. Parents were beaten, children were also blinded, unprovoked discrimination, the days were hard to live, I had dreamed several times that my father was killed, I used to swept through the crying, waking knowledge is dreaming. \\nIn the midst of hunger and cold, the death line not only forced to do unpaid slave labor, but also to impose super compulsory labor. Hometown cooking with firewood, awful collection of firewood, pressed him to breathe, round trip five, 60 miles, father can pick 60 pounds of firewood, turn over the mountains, river (winter also river), rainy day also go. Sometimes grilled firewood in the snow. Cold days wearing a single pants holding the legs, others asked, he said: 'Leg scratches will grow good, pants on this one.' No shoes, the mother made the sole with thick glue, shoulders were swollen, the mother made thick shoulder pads. Drinking of the water on the roadside, dry food is wild vegetable live sweet potato noodles cooked bread, back on the way to eat, or pick no firewood. Father always chop a stick holding, tired, use a stick to stand up the flat burden for a moment of rest. \\nI started collecting firewood at the age of eleven, and the moon was tall. It is common for the unseen road to come back, father sends duty firewood two, 300 pounds each year, and increases year after year. Brigade meetings, singing, lazy cadres for household use, the Cultural Revolution sent 1,800 pounds, do not pay any work, other work is like dry, already hungry bone as thin as firewood. \\nThe father ran the end of his life, the mother's feet planted, chop firewood, to other people spinning cotton fabric, do needlework, followed by the father's life suffering, beaten and humiliated. In 1984, poverty died prematurely, 66 years old. Has been poor jingle, big sister holding three sisters, two sister carrying small barrels and four towns begging. Dad said that my hour hungry neck could turn a circle, afraid of starvation, and I and my three sisters were ready to send people. Around 1980, my family was eating bad sweet potato noodles, bitter like poison, and we were hungry for decades. \\nIn 1979, the Central Committee letter in Luoyang approved the Luoyang area for my father's pacification, the brigade went to the county party to plead a plea, so that the withdrawal The Inner Mongolian United Front Department and the original organ gave the fight against it. The brigade also strongly opposes, and they believe that the central policy is wrong. \\n1980 Commune Secretary Liu brought a brigade section of the public security officer to my house. Liu asked: 'Should Ran return be controlled?' 'The material should not be controlled, it was approved by the brigade in 1963, and then looking for a commune.' Liu asked: 'This is legal?' Paragraph is not spoken. Twenty years of slave life was a big truth. It was that the brigade was one more obligatory laborer, and two decades of victimization. \\nIn 1981, the father was in his 60s, left and recruited several times in the field with high salaries. Students asked hard, a few people in the commune met, and he had walked out of hell into the earth and gained a third life. He said: 'My life The lives of millions of slaves, are unexpected lives, saved lives, get new life, should be done for the country... Sunset infinite, just nearly dusk, the wind candles, seize the light of the light, and again be tired to revive the economic culture of backward hometown, when doing its best, thanks to the Party for my grace' \\nIn 1979, the commune asked my father to go to the old county college entrance examination to review the surrogate, temporary worker, with a monthly salary of 40 yuan. 1980 Participated in Luoyang area entrance examination papers. In 1982 to Song County three middle school, at this time Zhengzhou paid to hire also did not go. \\n1983 to the county government to prepare a gazetteer for the national preparation of the Chinese Geographical Names Dictionary. To this end, nearly seventy years to visit the county, regardless of hypertension, heart disease, severe hemorrhoids. Eat dry food, drink cold water, climb the mountains, go through various weather changes, walk up to thousands of miles, forget all the hard work, hit the first line of China's Qinling-Yellow River altitude of 2000 meters high mountain ridge, write 'Songnan Travelogue'. In the same year, wrote the Songbei Traveller, and prepared tens of thousands of words long 'Songxian natural geography', while comrade county and CPPCC comrade letter draft, all made every effort to provide for the needs. \\nHis father did not have a day of leisurely life, in the three teachers were very good to him, he did not want to leave, leave a person to borrow a dormitory, the interior is very simple, a table and a bed a case, wall surrounded by celebrities and motto. One of the bedroom inscription such as 'a dream for decades, today is still lucky, Bu Gus room with grace'. Reading ancient books with a wide eye, writing, painting, planting vegetables, the beauty of Leshan forest with pottery. Tell the past, write thoughts to show future generations, observe mountains, explore science, understand the environment, or benefit people's livelihood. Doorknocester. with the world. Look at the changes of the wind and clouds, to Rakuten. Do not smell the words of praise, do not bet on the shape of the struggle, in the 'Taoyuan', and research the world through, this to the end, should it be asked to wuling! \\nHis father had only one wish, grab a limited old age, do something for his hometown, his hometown occupies all his place in his heart. Knowing that their age is high, once funny said: 'The old cow knows the sunset is short, do not have to whip himself'. Set a task for yourself to write ten books such as 'Song County', 'Legend of Yibin', 'Big Officer Trivia', 'Wicked Little Goodness', and also memorize many precious historical materials, in Song County, Luoyang literature and history of Henan province are recorded. In his seventies, the body always back a writing supplies bag, where to write. Winter hand frozen swollen and rotten. Because of writing too much, the middle finger of the right hand is bent, some people wonder: 'You leave for pension life, why are you busy than going to work?' He said, 'The party saved me twice to pay for this grace.' This person also said: 'The old society risked your life into the party, the new news agency went into the Communist Party prison... Why now do you have that effort.' He said: 'The old society I was against darkness rule. The rebellious rebellion was the truth of ancient times, liberated, I lost my body with the Communist Party yoke, and the party was generous to me. New China changed, I did education for many years, my daughter was out of school, wandering a"},

It is the third life to be saved today, and it is more important to do its best for the country.' \\nMy father was like this. Due to overwork, he eventually died of the case, and was seventy-seven years old. \\nThen he had a nickname called 'hard to live' dictionary 'weather station'. \\nHis father also had some geological knowledge, his hometown was poor, and he dreamed of finding gold mines. From 1953-1955 Guo Jiao sponsored his prospecting, trekking many places. Perennial hungry, on the road to collect firewood, see a piece of fluxite, to the book and indicate that you can mine. The book said at hand: 'What we dictatorship calls out of the mountains, we must produce any mines.' Thinking that there was a gold mine writing 'the natural geography of the old county' and suggested the construction of a cement factory, cadres thought it was paper free. Later many gold mines in his hometown, how many people get rich for this, he secretly happy, nor dare to believe his eyes. \\nIn Wangfu High School, he said that Wuqi had coal mines. Ask Wuqi students: 'Do you have a coal mine?' The student said, 'No.' He said, 'Yes, you go and ask.' Returning students from the holiday said: 'I asked a lot of people and said no,' he said, 'You ask again', and the student asked the county governor, and said, 'Your teacher is dreaming.' A large number of coal mines were discovered two years later. At this time, the County Governor said, 'Your teacher has 'clairvoyance, mountain lens'. Let him come, I will have a banquet.' Because of the frost lesson, the father only said, 'Blind cats hit dead rats.' \\nHis father had been suffering throughout his life, and knowledge was overwhelmed by that time. After three times before liberation, he gave his youth to the frontier. The new society was jailed, just 42 years old, just under the country season. Those jealous and envy sent him to jail for all sorts of charges. \\nMy father has received feudal education such as faithful, piety, merciful, love and so on, and learn Marxism at a young age, he sees these as the treasure, and strenuous life to adhere to his faith. He was arrested by the Kuomintang and searched the whole family's school. The magazine published in Yan'an, 'People's Philosophy', 'Chu De Chuan', was not detected. \\nA bitter life, land reform, home no treasures, only no cover box, no bucket table, broken bed. \\nMy life is very simple, has saved a lot of people. In difficulty, we also rescue two students, such as Xinxiang high school student Zhang Dongshan, family difficulties, and bear a lot of his study and living expenses. Twice a month to give him full financial support. After graduation, he will try to help him study and work in the North China liberated area, and give him travel fees to study at North China United University. In the early days of liberation in Zhengzhou helped a lot of people, there was a room, have to ask for transportation, have to work, often the house can not accommodate, live in the classroom. Even Sun Hongru, secretary general of the Kuomintang who ordered to hunt down his KMT, also asked him to say, 'I used to be too good to you, we are friends.' When it is extremely difficult to wander, it also borrowed to help Communist Party friends... Every year before the Spring Festival is obligated to write couplets, in three years 40 yuan a month living expenses, also commonly used in cartographic expenses.

In August 1936, he joined the Communist Party at Sun Yat-sen University. In November, he was assigned to Hong Kong as secretary of the Southern Interim Working Committee of the Communist Party of China. In April 1938, he was Minister of Propaganda and Minister of United War of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. \\nThe war of resistance against Japan had just won, and the country was filled with the clouds of civil war. In order to make the Chinese people aware of the CPC's policy of peaceful and democratic nation-building, the CPC Central Committee instructed all liberated areas to send cadres to major cities to open new propaganda positions immediately. Six cadres from Rao zhangfeng and Dongjiang column newspaper 'Forward Advance' were sent to Hong Kong. \\nIn order to spread the party's political ideas as soon as possible, Rao zhangfeng led a group of cadres to step up their preparations for the republication of the Chinese Business Daily. 'China Business Daily' is an influential newspaper issued by our party in Hong Kong during the war of resistance. It was published on April 8, 1941, and was suspended due to the outbreak of the Pacific War on 10 December 1941. \\nUnder the circumstances of the lack of human and material resources at that time, it was a very difficult matter to restore the large 'China Business Daily'. Rao zhangfeng runs around, working day and night. He found many democrats, patriotic overseas Chinese, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots to raise funds and organize teams. After the active activities of Rao zhangfeng, many prominent Hong Kong personalities, such as Huang Changshui and Zhuang Xiquan, have donated donations. The leadership team of China Business Daily consists of Communist Party cadres and patriots. At the beginning of the republication, Mr. Deng Wenzhao was a supervisor, general manager Sa Khong, editor-in-chief Liu Simu, deputy editor-in-chief Liao Maosha, manager Other editors and reporters are famous cultural people, such as Gao Tian, Li Shu, Yu Liting (Shaxi), Zhao Yuanhao, Lu Jian, Hua Jia, Huang Xinbo, Li Men and others. \\nAfter three months of intensive preparation and overcoming difficulties, China Business Daily was republished on January 4, 1946. The China Business Daily clearly expressed its position in the 'Republished Message': 'At this point, the victory has reached. At the beginning of its founding, this newspaper hastily republished in Hong Kong. It is still a people's bottom position, and with my compatriots at home and abroad, unveiling the banner of peace, unity, democracy, and creating a new centre of happiness, prosperity and democracy. Country and struggle.' \\nIn the early days of the republication, in the newspaper, the main representative of the party was Rao zhangfeng. He is responsible for personnel arrangements, editorial guidelines, internal and external matters. While his work was busy, he personally wrote some important editorials and reviewed some important documents. He is very good at unifying people, paying attention to mobilizing everyone's motivation. All major things have been consulted with other officials and brainstormed to make the 'China Business Daily' the better. Issued in Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan and Chongqing, etc., with great impact. \\nRao zhangfeng cares for the staff of the newspaper, warm as spring breeze. At that time, it was difficult to fund, the salaries of the staff of the newspaper were very low, and their lives were extremely poor, but everyone had the same goal, but the spirit was very happy. For those coming from the Dongjiang column, Rao zhangfeng also paid attention to training them, organizing them to learn politics, culture and technology. He regularly invites people with expertise to attend classes and to report them so that they can make progress in all areas quickly. Many of the staff members of the China Business Daily later became leaders of the Party and government departments. \\nRao zhangfeng is also responsible for other tasks while reopening the 'China Business Daily'. In order to promptly disseminate the voice of the CPC Central Committee and news published by Xinhua News Agency, the Xinhua Hong Kong Branch started the Xinhua South News Agency prior to its preparations in 1947. The Central Committee appointed Rao zhangfeng as President. \\nBefore and after the East longitudinal North withdrawal, many people went to Hong Kong and went to China Business Newspaper for party organizations. Rao zhangfeng always welcomed them enthusiastically and tried to solve their accommodation and arrange their work. Liao Maosha, deputy editor-in-chief of the Chinese Business Daily and later vice chairman of the Beijing CPPCC, recalled: 'At that time, the 'China Business Daily' was equivalent to a reception station, and the 'Webmaster' was Rao zhangfeng. And he said, 'Inside and out, he is a 'big supervisor. ' The amount of work is unthinkable. At that time without him. That doesn't know what kind of situation is.' \\nAt this time, due to the initiative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to withdraw from Yan'an, the Nanyang overseas Chinese society is more chaotic, and many overseas Chinese are very worried about the future and fate of the motherland. Hu Yuzhi, hosted by the Nanqiao Daily in Singapore, asked to send people to assist the work. In order to strengthen the leadership of Nanyang overseas Chinese, Xia Yan and Rao zhangfeng went to Malaysia. In January 1947, Xia Yan was the head of Singapore's 'Nanqiao Daily', and formed a cultural group. Xia Yan was the leader of the group, including Zhang Zhaohan, Wu Dizhou, Zhang Bifu and so on. \\nRao zhangfeng worked in Malaysia in April 1947. In less than half a year, he travelled almost to Malaysia's slightly larger towns and made many overseas friends. At that time, the Kuomintang army had captured Zhangjiakou, Yan'an fell, and the progress of the overseas Chinese were very worried. Rao zhangfeng made reports to overseas Chinese in various places to introduce the domestic situation. He pointed out that despite the twists and turns of the Chinese revolution, it will surely win, the people who provoke the civil war, depleted people, and the fate of failure awaits them. His report greatly encouraged the confidence of overseas Chinese and promoted the patriotic democracy movement in overseas Chinese society. \\nDuring Malaya, Rao zhangfeng also paid attention to the upper ranks of the overseas Chinese. He directly approached the famous overseas Chinese leader, Mr. Chen Jiageng, and briefed him on the domestic situation in a truthful manner, expounded the ideas and policies of the Communist Party, so that Mr. Chen further saw the overall situation. Both he and the patriotic democrats actively donated to support the people's liberation war. \\nAt the end of 1947, Rao zhangfeng returned to Hong Kong. In February 1948, Rao zhangfeng was sent to Malaysia to organize the Singapore branch of Xinhua News Agency. At that time, the Xinhua News Agency established branches overseas were London and Hong Kong. At the same time, Rao zhangfeng and others have set up a new democracy publishing house to promote progressive books published in China and Hong Kong. \\nBack to Hong Kong to prepare for the establishment of a new China\\nIn June 1948, Rao zhangfeng returned to Hong Kong. At that time, the situation in the war of liberation had changed fundamentally, with the PLA's strategic counterattack winning one after another. After Rao zhangfeng returned to Hong Kong, in addition to assisting Zhang Hanfu in leading the work of the China Business Daily, the main task is to unite the various democratic parties and patriots and consolidate the development of the united front. \\nHe has done four major things during this period: (1), transporting leaders of democratic parties and society in Hong Kong to the liberated areas. (2), to send our party's backbone strength in Hong Kong to the liberated areas of the Mainland. (3), cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to march victory, instigated the KMT army uprising in Guangdong, Fujian and other places. (4), to help the Kuomintang military and political personnel who are ready to abandon the dark cast to connect with the Communist Party. \\nOn April 30, 1948, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), called for 'all democratic parties and societies to promptly convene political consultation meetings to discuss and achieve the convening of a people's congress and the formation of a democratic coalition government.' This call reflects the common aspirations of the people of the country and the diaspora, who called and responded enthusiastically. On August 1, Mao Zedong called the various democratic parties and patriotic democrats, inviting them to come to the liberated areas to discuss the issue of convening the new CPPCC. \\nAt that time, a large number of democratic party leaders and social leaders and prominent personalities gathered in Hong Kong. How to safely escort them to the liberated areas is a very difficult political task. \\nThe situation in Hong Kong at the time was very complex, and the north liberated area was inconvenient by land and could only take the sea by boat. Coherent, Rao zhangfeng and the light of money together, sleepless, repeated research, carefully arranged. In order to reduce the attention of the outside world, usually on board the boat at night, after departure after departure after departure, after departure by escort comrades, from each person's place of residence, sometimes first transfer to another place, and then board the boat. After careful arrangements, leaders of the various democratic parties and eminent personalities were escorted from Hong Kong in batches by Zhang Hanfu, Li Ka-ren and Chun comrades. Li Jishen is a very influential figure. He has close ties with the Chinese Communist Party, has frequent contacts with the Hong Kong authorities and the US, and all political forces want to fight for him. Under such a complex situation, Li Jishen is going to leave Hong Kong smoothly, indeed, a lot of resistance. In order to confuse the outside world, he also attended Mr. Deng Wenzhao's banquet that night. At the same time, Zhu Yunshan, Wu Maosun and others participated. After the seat, they sailed on a pre-prepared boat to a Soviet cargo ship, and arranged in the captain's room, very cleverly arranged. Two or three days after Li Ji-shen left Hong Kong, tracking and monitoring his talent found, but it was too late. More than 10 days later, the members of Bai Chongxi sent to fight for Li Jishen arrived in Hong Kong, and heard that Li Jishen had gone, and had to sigh at the heavens. \\nFrom late August 1948 to early 1949, all heads of democratic parties and eminent personalities in Hong Kong left Hong Kong safely to the liberated areas and moved to Beiping for a new political consultation meeting. Rao zhangfeng and comrades successfully completed this major task, and was praised by Zhou Enlai. \\nWith the victory of the People's Liberation War Festival, Jiang's dynasty quickly collapsed. Some KMT military and political personnel saw the situation gone and did not want to marry for it. Some people wandered to see and find a way out. Some people took the initiative to go to Hong Kong to take a line with our party and would be willing to abandon the speculation. The situation shows that counter-policy work is becoming increasingly important on our party's agenda. Rao zhangfeng, who is responsible for the United War work, has done a lot of work and personally participated in initiating the Guangdong East uprising, Shixing uprising in northern Guangdong, West Fujian uprising and two air uprisings. \\nFrom the beginning of the Guangdong uprising, Rao zhangfeng participated in the planning. According to Wei Jianxian, one of the main initiators of the uprising, recalled that in the second half of 1947, he secretly went to Hong Kong to connect with Rao zhangfeng. In 1948, he and Xiao Wen went to Hong Kong for two talks with Rao zhangfeng. 'In both conversations, Comrade Rao zhangfeng gave me inspiration to education and inspiration,' Wei said, 'I feel a great honor and excitement.' In mid-March 1949, Wei Jianxian and Zeng Tien again went to Hong Kong to meet Fang Fang and Rao zhangfeng. 'We secretly met Rao zhangfeng in Hong Kong branch of the Chinese Communist Party of China and Comrade Fang. We felt endless warmth, warmth and excitement as a traveller returned to meet their loved ones,' said Zeng Tien in memories. Fang and Rao zhangfeng warmly praised their return to the people's righteous actions and gave instructions on the timing of their intifada. Rao zhangfeng also discussed with Wei Jianxian and Zeng Tien Festival on the declaration and action plan on the intifada. Li Jie-zhi, Inspector General and Security Commander of the Kuomintang Meizhou District (Kuomintang Guangdong Province), also secretly traveled to Hong Kong to discuss with Rao zhangfeng and other issues related to the intifada. \\nOn May 14, 1949, Wu Qiwei, deputy director of the pacification office of the Guangdong Province of the Kuomintang province, and Li Jie-zhi, Zeng Tianjie, Xiao Wen, Wei Jianxian, Wei Hanxin, Lan Juchu and Zhang Sukui, issued a declaration of uprising in Lao Long. On the same day, Zeng Day led the security 13 regiment in the old uprising, old long, Longchuan declared liberation. Then, the uprising forces collaborated with the guerrilla column of Guangdong Ganxiang to liberate Heping County. On May 14, Meixian Weihan new rate security twelve regiment, county governor Zhang Junxie two security camps simultaneously announced the uprising, Meixian declared peaceful liberation. May 18, Meizhou District Commissioner Li Jie Zhi and Xingning County Governor Chen Yuping led the Ministry at the same time uprising, Xingning declared peaceful liberation. On May 20, Pingyuan County Security Battalion Wei Qing Rage Department uprising. At the end of May, Huilai County, surrounded by local people's armed forces, the County Governor Zou Ying responded to the uprising in Laolong and other places, declaring Huilai liberation. 'On June 21, Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De sent a reply to the insurgents such as Wu Qiwei, Li Jie-zhi, Zeng Tien Festival and other intifada, saying they Jiamian. \\nThe KMT Commissioner in Minxi is also in contact with our party organizations by Hong Kong. Fang Fang and Rao zhangfeng received him and welcomed them to hold an uprising at the appropriate time. On May 22, 1949, Li Hanchong, Lian Tisheng, Fu Baicui led the Li Hanzheng Self-Defense Force (equivalent to a regiment), and Li Yu security regiment, along with Longyan County Governor Zhang Tangming, Liancheng County Governor Zhang Youming, Shanghang County Changqiu Shiyan, Yongan County Governor Lai Zuoliang, Wuping County Governor Wang Zhongtai and self-defense in these five counties Team, announced the uprising, liberated Longyan, Shanghang, Yongding, Wuping, Changting, Zhangping and other seven counties. \\nIn addition, there are several bank uprisings, such as the Shixing uprising in Northern Guangdong, the 'Two Air Uprising', the 'Warship Lingfu Uprising', and the Bank of Fujian Hong Kong Branch, etc. Rao zhangfeng has been directly involved in the initiative and has achieved significant results. \\nOn the eve of the liberation of Guangzhou, Rao zhangfeng, together with comrades, made every effort to do the work of old military and political personnel, and asked them to protect the property of the organs and accept the takeover of our Party cadres. If you have mobilized Yu Hanmou's Chief of Staff Liang Shiji to provide military information on Guangdong, contact the relevant Guangzhou units to keep the relevant internal file information. Under the leadership of the Party, the 'maternity care movement' in Guangzhou was launched rapidly. At that time, a secretary of the Relief Department of the Kuomintang Executive Council took the initiative to bring a batch of 'manifests' to Hong Kong to contact our party, suggesting that if he could guarantee his safety and arrange his work after liberation, he would try to save millions of dollars of US aid supplies. Rao zhangfeng personally spoke with him, so that the supplies were kept safely. \\nWhile completing all the major tasks, Rao zhangfeng still adheres to the Party's propaganda position. 'Masses' weekly has been published until the eve of the liberation of Guangzhou; 'China Business Daily' announced the completion of its historic mission on October 15, 1949 after the news of the liberation of Guangzhou. \\nRao zhangfeng ushered in the liberation of Guangzhou with his hard struggle, forgettable work with comrades. \\n'United War Skillers'\\nRao zhangfeng returned to Guangzhou, immediately put into a stressful takeover work. At that time, the director of the Guangzhou Municipal Military Control Commission was Ye Jianying, Rao zhangfeng was responsible for taking over the press and publishing system, and was the head of the provincial press and publication department. \\nAfter the takeover work, the Party gave Rao zhangfeng a task: to establish the United Front Department of the South China Branch, unite all democratic parties, patriots, overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, develop the people's democratic united front, and strive for the construction of a new China. Ye Jianying South, once asked successive: 'Who engaged in the united war work in Guangzhou?' Consistent answer without hesitation: 'Rao zhangfeng can.' A short sentence fully reflects the trust and praise of his party comrades. \\nRao zhangfeng has served as vice-minister and minister of the United Front Department of the South China Central Branch of the CPC Central Committee and head of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. \\nRao zhangfeng asked comrades to help democratic parties solve their work and study problems, and encourage them to work hard to learn Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought and overcome their shortcomings. He personally consulted with the leaders of the Democratic Party and quickly selected their office locations. The NLD was in the Aiqun Building, the Democratic Revolution in the former KMT Australia branch office, and the new air road of the Gong Party in Xiguan, so that the democratic parties could work in a timely manner. \\nIn the early days of the founding of the country, about 4,500 democratists and progressive people gathered in Guangzhou. In order to play their director, Rao zhangfeng speaks to them every day from morning to night, to understand their wishes, consult with them, and then relocate one by one according to the needs of the work and their specific circumstances and requirements. If a former Secretary of the Relief Agency, who helped protect a large number of 'US aid' materials, arranged to be a cadre in the provincial business department. Singapore's overseas Chinese Hong Junsheng and Wu Yusun, who helped our party financially, were placed to work in the financial sector and later joined the party. One skilled person is placed in a position that can play its expertise, reflecting the principle that 'any good thing that has done good for the people, the people will not forget'. \\nIn the early days of the founding of the nation, the Kuomintang left us a mess economically. At the same time, the US imperialism launched a war of aggression against North Korea, imposing a tight economic blockade on me, in an attempt to stifle the new China in the cradle. According to the situation at home and abroad and the central task of the Party at that time, Rao zhangfeng mobilized overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao patriotic businessmen to return to invest and operate enterprises to help the motherland in economic construction. In February 1951, Rao zhangfeng and the leaders of relevant departments formed the 'public-private South China Enterprise Co., Ltd.' ('China Enterprise'). This is the first public-private joint venture in China to attract investment from overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao businessmen. Under the leadership of Rao zhangfeng and other comrades, 'China Enterprises' took advantage of its special position and relations with Hong Kong and Macao to actively participate in the country's efforts to smuggle goods. For example, in 1951, the import of transportation equipment accounted for more than 70 percent of the total import. In 1952, a large number of imported materials such as hardware, rubber, Western medicine, scientific instruments and other materials were imported, the quantity is considerable. We also carry out exports, seek foreign exchange for the country and help state-owned companies to stabilize prices. \\nWith the principle of 'business as the main, industry as the deputy, the maintenance of workers, the gradual transition to industry' as the principle of 'China Enterprises', while mainly economic and commercial, increased investment in industry and opened a number of factories. The company operates factories: Guangzhou Nanfang Knitting Factory, Xu Wen Huanan Sugar Factory, Guangning Huanan Rosin Factory, Dongguan Powder Factory, and Guangzhou Sanlian Yarn Line. These factories have played an active role in agricultural production services. For example, South China sugar mills can squeeze 20 million pounds of sugar cane in a season, equivalent to the total output of more than 4,000 acres of sugar cane fields at that time, benefiting 3,000 farmers. Flour mills, rosin plants, etc. can benefit tens of thousands of farmers. 'Huaqi' has also invested in Beijing Xinqiao Hotel. In short, 'Chinese enterprises' companies have made a certain contribution in supporting the anti-US aid to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, anti-economic blockade, and in supporting nation-building. They have also played a certain role in securing the return of overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots to invest and expand the patriotic united front. \\nIn August 1951, Rao zhangfeng also helped repatriated overseas Chinese Xue Liangqing, Wang Yuanxing and others founded 'Guangdong Overseas Chinese Industrial Construction Co., Ltd.' ('Huajian'). After the company was founded, it opened a sack factory in Guangzhou, built an overseas Chinese guest house in Shenzhen, and later built the Overseas Chinese Building in Guangzhou. Under the influence of 'Huajian', overseas overseas Chinese have returned to invest in China. The overseas Chinese village in Guangzhou is built by the majority of overseas Chinese investment. The two enterprises, 'China Enterprise' and 'Huajian', have supported the economic construction of the anti-US aid North Korea and the motherland, and expanded the patriotic united front. These efforts have been praised by Prime Minister Zhou Enlai. \\nIn addition to the business community, Rao zhangfeng has also mobilized many overseas Chinese cultural and intellectuals to return to work. He said to them, 'It is hard to come back to life, but the motherland needs you. Lu En, Yang Jia, Hong Sisi, Zhang Chukun, Chen Zhongda, Hu Weifu and Huang Dynasty Chinese intellectuals who returned home in that year, became the backbone of each unit or assumed leadership roles. \\nIn his contacts with many democrats, overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, Rao zhangfeng has never put an official shelf in order to treat people sincerely and become a friend of the United Nations war targets. Speaking about the impression Rao zhangfeng gave him, Xue Liangqing said: 'He is approachable, he has no official attitude, full of pure feelings to people.' \\nIn the democratic reform movement at the beginning of the founding of the country, Rao zhangfeng dared to adhere to the principles of the Party, adhere to the spirit of truthfulness, and protect those outside the party who had contributed to the revolution. If there is a former KMT officer, a person who has had merit to the people, has helped our party and revolutionary cause to do a lot of good things. When land reform, some cadres have to send him back to the countryside to fight. At the meeting, Rao zhangfeng conducted a comprehensive and historical analysis of him, affirming his contribution to the revolution, and suggested that he could be seriously critical of education, but do not return to the countryside to fight to ensure his personal safety. For example, in the 'Three Reversals' and 'Five Counters' movements, some people suspected of embezzlement by a businessman. Rao zhangfeng said, what is the basis that he is corrupt? He put his money out to support nation-building, and lived very frugal. Do not doubt him because he has problems in his history, and inflict an unscrupulous affliction. \\nIn the fight against the 'right', there has been a misconception of the so-called 'more credit for the right'. And Rao zhangfeng, who dared to adhere to the principle, was seen as 'right', standing on the side. However, although Rao zhangfeng is in adversity, it disregards personal gains and losses, takes the interests of the revolution at the forefront, insists on the truth and adheres to the Party's policy. At that time, some comrades debated the patriot Deng and some five others to be classified as 'right'. He described with great responsibility their past contributions to the revolution. Regarding Deng, Rao zhangfeng pointed out that he is a well-known patriot in Hong Kong and an old friend of our party. During the war of resistance, he ceded his house in Hong Kong as an office of the Eighth Route Army to help set up the China Business Newspaper. During the war of liberation, he helped my party to do a great deal of work to unite the business community. In the early days of the founding, he served as manager of South China Enterprise Co., Ltd., director of Guangdong Federation of Industry and Commerce, has played a very good role in unity and transformation of the business community, building the motherland. From the consistent performance, how can I say that Deng is opposed to the Communist Party leadership? \\nRegarding Zeng's situation, Rao zhangfeng said that while he was the district commander, he had covered in his home three Communist Party members who were tracked by KMT agents, allowing them to transfer safely. When he was commander of the Guangdong and Chinese railway guard, he also transported two carts of leather guns and ammunition to Xiangxi and gave it to my anti-Japanese troops. On behalf of the Party Central Committee, Liao Chengzhi expressed his gratitude to him for this matter. After his founding, he also played an active role in unifying the former KMT military and political personnel in building the motherland. \\nRao zhangfeng repeatedly told Ouxin, director of the Office of the United Front Department of the Provincial Committee, that the problems of Deng and Zeng should be carefully and carefully verified. If they have errors, criticism is OK. If you want to draw the 'right', we should be careful. As a result, they were not classified as 'right-wing elements'. \\nRao zhangfeng also always resolves it in a timely manner in accordance with the Party's policy. In 1955, a cadre named Chen lodged a complaint to the Provincial Committee United Front Department. Chen Yuan is a progressive overseas Chinese living in Malaysia. He returned home with his wife in 1951 and was assigned to work in an economic sector, and his wife is a primary school teacher. Chen was purged out in 1952 because of alleged political problems. The life of a family of four people was only dependent on the salaries of his wife's primary school teachers, and it was very difficult to maintain. Chen's father-in-law is still in Malaya, a rich and prestigious overseas Chinese. But Chen is afraid to affect the prestige of my party and never mention the difficult things of life in foreign communications. After Rao zhangfeng received Chen's complaint, immediately sent a cadre director and a cadre to investigate the matter. After the investigation is completed, the United Front Department, together with the relevant departments, will give Chen Pingbian, rearranging his work by the United Front Department, and is assigned to administrative level 18 based on Chen's consistent performance and ability to work. Chen was touched by this organizational decision. \\nThe above examples are endless. Rao zhangfeng is just like this. Rao zhangfeng has always adhered to the spirit of truth and pragmatism of our Party, treat patriotic democratic personalities, protect politically, take care of their lives, and share with them the wind and rain, honor and disgrace. Until now many people still miss him deeply, praising him for being a good cadre who 'firmly and firmly implements the Party's policy and can unite people.' During his tenure as United Front Minister and Vice Chairman of the Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, Guangdong Province has made significant achievements in the United War work. Hu Yuzhi once praised: 'Comrade Changfeng is very good, is the skill to do the United War work.' \\nBut under the 'left' wave of thinking, Rao zhangfeng has been unjust criticism and undue blow. 'Chinese enterprise' was described as a 'black model'. Comrades such as Rao zhangfeng were accused of 'leading South China companies with a strong bourgeoisie view and feelings, and disarm ideas in the fight against the bourgeois,' were criticized by the party briefing. Some of the shortcomings and mistakes of Rao zhangfeng were exaggerated, and criticism of him escalated gradually. In 1958, Rao zhangfeng was described as 'having committed a serious right-leaning surrender, serious regionalism and serious anti-party activity', and was dismissed and demoted to Lianping Mountain. \\nAlthough Rao zhangfeng suffered blows and setbacks, it still has no complaints and obeys the decisions of the organization. At that time, a comrade encountered the same doom. There was a lot of thought pressure. Rao zhangfeng sincerely encouraged him to treat him correctly, and could not be passive grievances. With a bold loyalty to the Party and the people, Rao zhangfeng set aside personal gains and losses and embarked on the rugged mountain road leading to Lianping. \\nPersonality Charm\\nRao zhangfeng's character, reputation. Comrades from the original Guangzhou Institute of Foreign Languages 'Rao Chang Wind Biography' have interviewed el"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "derly people who have been rare for many years, they talked about Rao zhangfeng are very excited. When interviewing Hu Yuzhi, Xia Yan, Liao Maosha and others, they were old, and after the storm impact of the 'Cultural Revolution', the old age is weak and generally do not receive visits. Liao Masha also hung the sign 'Doctors ordered not to receive visits' on the door. But when they learned that they came to learn about Rao zhangfeng and write for Rao zhangfeng, they immediately arranged time to come to their home for detailed discussion. When it comes to Rao zhangfeng, all hot tears. \\nXue Liangqing, a patriotic overseas Chinese in Guangzhou, mentioned the name of Rao zhangfeng, immediately tears watched, originally scheduled for one afternoon, and later turned into two afternoons. He said: Changfeng's help and care for me is really too great, and it is difficult to express my gratitude in words. Until now, I will not forget. 'After the start of the Cultural Revolution. He was shut down. I couldn't meet me, but he still thought about me, specifically asked his original driver to see me and comfort me. There was one night, wind and rain. He driver came to my house with the instructions of Rao zhangfeng, and in those unrest and tense days, it was rare to have an acquaintance to visit. Hear he conveyed Rao zhangfeng's orders, I really moved and tears DC.' \\nAfter the Cultural Revolution began, Rao zhangfeng was subjected to a brutal struggle. But he did not yield, and even under the threat of 'fake shooting', still insisted on party principles and did not say false remarks. In Lechang Prison, on one occasion, a task force member and foreign transfer personnel forced Rao zhangfeng to write false material, proving that a comrade was a 'traitor'. But he did not cater to their wishes, saying that the comrade was not a 'traitor', but a good comrade. So they angered the group, and they pushed Rao zhangfeng into the pit outside of the interrogation and buried alive, while filling the soil and forcing him to say false words. Faced with death, he had no fear and insisted on not falsehood. \\nBehind bars, Rao zhangfeng realized that the fierce and more Ji less, in the havoc. He thought of his hometown that he had never returned after participating in the revolution, remembering relatives and friends who had lost their lives for the revolution, avoiding guards in prison, and wrote 'Qinyuan Chun, the hometown of Tai Po' with blood and tears, and caught it in a book. Before the dying, Rao zhangfeng gave old clothes to the poor farmers of his hometown, his loved ones apart a look, a profound words show in front of your eyes:\\nPen frame peak, Insan small, lion throat (Lion mouth is a narrow mouth near the Han River flow through Chayang). Yi tea Yang style, remembering the old. Qingquan crane (crane top, also known as 'white crane Qing book', the peak has Qingquan Temple), Xizhao Star Bridge, dam gunfire (reactionary often in the dam shot revolutionaries), God drum should (City God Temple incense fire, every day there are drumming sound), how many heroes hard bones, change the day, Han River roar, everywhere Burning! \\nLate autumn, Sanhe dam three thousand loyal harvest (Nanchang uprising forces south of Chaoshan, a fierce battle with the reactionaries in Sanhe Dam, sacrificing many comrades). The red regime, Tai Ning Yi (the intifada forces retreated left several people here to help establish the red regime), Gao Pi Baihou, Flag Shu Gaoqiu, North out Pingsha (Pingsha is a transportation station to Central Soviet District, close to Fujian border), direct access to Fujian Gan, Red River Tianshu Wuzhou. Red day, zhao Qingfeng trail (Qingfeng trail is the most dangerous mountain road leading to Central Su District), a long stay. \\nDapu, on the border of Guangdong and Fujian, close to Longyan and Changting areas of Fujian, was the old base of the first domestic revolutionary war period. The word Rao zhangfeng is full of the author's deep attachment to the native land, remembering the long years of the people of Tai Po who went to the future, the heroic struggle and the fierce scene of the Nanchang uprising forces in the Sanhe Dam. The poem is majestic, passionate, sonorous, words and words, express the author's conviction that justice will prevail over evil, a firm belief in the bright future of the country. \\nOn September 12, 1970, Rao zhangfeng was persecuted to death. \\nHistory has not faded, memories are always alive. Long before embarking on the revolutionary journey, Rao zhangfeng used the pen name 'chasing light' to publish articles in the newspaper. The so-called 'chasing light' means the pursuit of truth, longing for light. For this he struggled his life, always unwavering. That's his style, his charm!

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】Four books of Ramadan: 'Correction' or 'Correction', this is a problem\\nA while ago received three 'right-wing corrective report forms', one of which is Comrade Ran longshou Longshou from Chongqing Wanxian Food Bureau. The format of this table should be a national uniform format. In addition to the common content of the table, such as name, gender, origin, origin, origin, resume, etc., there are three columns designed to be relatively good Special, caught my attention. The most concerned is the item 'The facts of the original right and the conclusion of review', which should undoubtedly be the most important item in the table. In the Ran longshou Longshou Correction Report Form, I reproduce the contents of this column as follows:\\nFirst, the original conclusion said: 'praised the reactionary speech of the right-wing elements of the Party,'\\nIn May 1957, when the reactionary remarks of the right-wing Ju Anping Party appeared in the press, he said in a morning study: 'To say, these people have the courage.' \\nThis is an issue of awareness, not right-wing speech. \\nSecond, the original conclusion says: 'against the dissatisfaction with the opposition'\\nIn November 1957, the food station maver*** informed Ran longshou went to the district committee to listen to the report, Ran longshou asked what report, *** said it might be to convey the counteraction summary report of the county committee, and said with dissatisfaction: 'What kind of repudiation is the report of the district committee?' \\nThis is not a right-wing speech at all. \\nIII. The original conclusion says: 'Oppose and abusive leadership'\\nOn the afternoon of April 1958, Ran longshouhe County Food Burea***, ** and others chatted at the grain station, they were far from seeing the station mast*** playing the ball back from the water field, Ran longshou joked: 'Our webmaster is back.' At that time, the little girl (7 years old), at the time said, 'Ran longshou Accountant says you are the head of the ball.' \\nJust one such thing, it is not appropriate to qualify as opposing abusive leadership. \\nFourth, the original conclusion says: 'Dissatisfaction with wage reform'\\nWhen the salary was adjusted in the second half of 1956, Ran longshou went to the health office and said: 'A old man, the public security fighter took 40 yuan.' \\nThis is an opinion on the wages of individual comrades, not right-wing speech. \\nThus, although Ran longshou Longshou has general historical problems, there is no right-wing rhetoric in the anti-right, is a misrepresentation of the right, and should be corrected, political honor restored and salary administration level 23. \\nThe above content can be seen, at that time Comrade Ran longshou Longshou was classified as the right, dismissed from public office, how wise the organization of the corrective period was, corrected the error. However, through this section of content reminiscent of the words, the same party with the same sentence, at this time and other times the conclusions are completely different. Conviction on the line of the outline, correction of a thin cloud. \\nThe second column of interest is 'If there are new mistakes or crimes and handling situation after right-wing', 'None' in the column of Ran longshou Longshou. Don't say if Ran longshou Longshou has a new crime above it can correct the problem. Just in terms of the design of this column, we still think that the anti-right movement is correct, there is no problem. Right elements have the wrong position, that is, guilty. It has only expanded in the course of the movement, misguided many people. In fact, so far, only a dozen people across the country have not been corrected. Even if these dozen people are real right-wing, is it appropriate to set off a massive nationwide anti-right movement for these dozen people? In 1981, the Sixth Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party said in the Resolution on Certain Issues of the History of the Party since the founding of the State: 'In the process of winding, very few bourgeois right-wing activists have taken the opportunity to advocate for the so-called Dashiming magnification, to launch a wanton offensive against the party and the nascent socialist system, in an attempt to replace the Communist Party, a resolute response to this attack is entirely right and necessary. But the fight against the right has been severely expanded, with a group of intellectuals, patriots and party cadres misclassified as right-wing elements, with unfortunate consequences.' This has in fact drawn conclusions about the correctness of the anti-right movement, and this is now the conclusion. So, according to this conclusion, for more than half a million 'corrective' right, they were only martyrs of a dozen so-called real right-wing elements at the time. \\nThe third column of interest is 'my opinion on the review conclusion', Comrade Ran longshou Longshou wrote this way:\\n'First, I thank the CPC Central Committee and President of China for correcting my right-wing speech and restoring my political reputation. In the future, I have contributed everything to the four modernisation in my work. \\nSecond, praised the reactionary remarks of the right-wing party, the reactionary remarks in the world: according to Zhang ** revealing, it was not learning to say, saying that I was read by the newspaper, but when Zhang said, I was hospitalized in a special district hospital, I did not say this at all.' \\nThis personal opinion was the most saddening. I think the overwhelming majority of the corrective right-wing elements at that time showed their determination to the organization with the same spirit of gratitude Dade as Ran longshou Longshou. For 20 years of inhuman life, right-wing elements affected by various movements can no longer be inferior, can be the first ones, how could they not thank Dade for the organization that corrects your right-wing identity? The organization is not wrong, the movement is not wrong, it is wrong in itself, otherwise Ran longshou Longshou will not, at the time of correction, still justify such problems as the time and place of his so-called praise of the remarks made by Mr. Chu Anping. \\nCorrection of misguided right-wing elements illustrates the organization's responsible attitude towards its own expansionism; it requires real courage if it is possible to adopt a corrective attitude towards the anti-right movement itself, as was the case with the Cultural Revolution. \\n'Correction' and 'correction' are only the difference between the word, but for the more than 500,000 dead and alive right-wing elements, the conclusion of 'correcting' will make them truly dignified!"}

He said: 'With regard to the priority development of heavy industries, it is difficult for the masses to accept a good amount of power. Also, if the general purchase and sales of the masses do not agree, re-education, but it is said that it is the demand of the people, in order to be good.' Ren chuangeng also said that collectivitalization is to 'be able to supervise each other, easy to control, and easy to find in meetings. In addition, it is afraid of rebellion, whoever knows who, rural areas are easy to rule. This is like putting people into concentration camps in the past, there is no trench, not easy to recognize.' Ren chuangeng thinks that at present many organs and enterprises are named 'people', but only 'beautiful names'. For example, the People's Congress, 'It is an organization representing the Communist Party. All resolutions are implemented by the Party Central Committee by voting. It seldom discusses the views of the grassroots people and gives the opportunity to vote.' Ren chuangeng also believes that all the things with the words 'people' are done by the Party, not by ordinary people, but instead of replacing it with the word 'Communist Party'. \\nRen chuangeng also said: 'I see that the right-wing speech is almost right. I think Ge Pei Qi's speech is not all right, but at least there are people who want to kill the Communist Party in the country'; 'This is exactly the way that the whole of China is party rule,' Zhang Bojun's 'Political Design Institute' mentioned, everyone should discuss Negotiate'. \\nRen chuangeng also said: 'I particularly disagree with Chairman Mao's statement: only be honest with the enemy, not to speak of chaos.' He also said: 'The victory of communism is a victory of force, not a triumph of theory, a special authoritarian rule of the party. Others don't even speak with weapons. If you relax these parties don't necessarily rule well.' \\nRen said: 'I don't think Chiang Kai-shek hitting back is bad for himself.' He believes that the current freedom does not conform to the spirit stipulated in the Constitution, saying: 'Speech cannot be casual, no violation of Marxism. Mouth can only be used to eat and talk to work.' He also repeatedly sighed 'unexpected times' and said: 'I want to leave here to find plots of land to plant, but the rural collectivise; go to the mountains and fear that others will have to denounce it; go to a foreign country without the permission of the government, and the defense is very strong and unable to cross the border. So, I had to be stuffy here.' \\nThese reactionary remarks were made by Ren chuangeng at the Third Clinical College Colleges Seminar from July 1 to 3. Since the fight against the right, Ren Chuaneng has adopted a tactics of war and retreat in an attempt to blame. He had done a 'review', saying that he still had a lot of reactionary remarks, let him speak for two days, and said: 'This is what you told me, so speaking out can only be counted as reactionary thought, not reactionary remarks.' \\nIn addition to strongly rebutting the reactionary rhetoric of Ren Chuan Teng, the people present at the meetings further debunked his two-sided tactics. The masses unanimously warned Ren Chuaneng that the motives and root causes of anti-socialist anti-socialist rhetoric must be honestly explained, and not to be left to the people.

Certainly, soon received a letter from the editor of the publication, saying it had been adopted, and then sent a clear sample. I was full of thinking that this was no problem. Who knows that after the new issue of the publication is printed, there is no one of my articles. This must be because the publication wrote to school to understand my situation, knowing that I was 'hat-picking right', so the original printed article was abandoned. This hit me a lot, and since then, no more contributions to the outside. In 1966, when the Cultural Revolution began, my old teacher from the old society was labelled as 'reactionary academic authority,' and after being criticized, engaged in labor. Later after Lin Biao's Order No. 1, I went along with other teachers and students to work in Zhuyang Town, Lingbao County, Yuxi, and went back to Kaifeng for almost a year. Then went to the forest farm in Dongqi County, Henan, and later went to the Weishi Farm. We did not return to school until 1972 on the eve of recruiting workers and peasants. At that time, the leadership assigned me as 'Lu Xun's Choice' class, I thought that Beijing understood how Beijing universities were preparing to teach this course, and the leaders approved me to go to Beijing. After going to Beijing, I went to Peking University, Normal University, People's Congress, and Ren fangqiued the experts who studied Lu Xun to learn how they chose articles and how they taught them. After coming back, in the first class of workers and peasants enrolled, I served as a lecture of 'Lu Xun Works Selection'. According to the students, it was quite successful.

His father was born at the end of the Qing Dynasty, he went to the province to attend the township test, not the first, soon to abolish, he sent my brother to Nanyang to study secondary school, that is, he taught me at home and two brothers to read four books \\nIn 1919, I was 10 years old, graduated at the age of 12. For a variety of reasons, it was not possible to enroll in secondary school. At the end of 1923, one of my cousins, who studied first teacher in Henan Province in Kaifeng, went home for the Spring Festival and persuaded my father and brother to go to Kaifeng to study with him. Father agreed. After the Spring Festival, we followed the crown five brother, together with other students studying in Kaifeng. \\nAfter opening, because the middle school has not reached the admission time, in order to prepare for the test, my brother and I stayed in West Avenue to review their homework. By the time of the summer exam, we both took three schools, namely, one provincial division, provincial 1 middle school and provincial secondary school. Both of us are among the top in one middle school and one division. A division was a relatively good school in Henan, it was formerly known as the senior teacher of Henan province, books and equipment are more complete. Due to the abundance of funds, schools employ high salary outstanding students graduating from famous domestic universities and experienced teachers to teach. \\nAfter we enrolled, the teacher of our national language classes was later a well-known scholar, Mr. Ji Wenfu. His knowledge and character influenced me greatly, and he was a great example of my life learning. After I enrolled, I felt that this school style was fine. 1. democratic air is relatively strong, students are more free, usually go to the streets not necessarily need to take leave, but the students do very few school regulations, and generally can consciously observe discipline. 2. the whole school students have a self-learning culture. 3. Freedom of association and a great culture of publication of articles, school authorities encourage students to set up academic societies and distribute paper and large frames to give out posters. At that time, senior students had established a youth society, which had a reading room; many newspapers had been booked for students to read. Therefore, the students' minds are extremely active. \\nOn the eve of North Far, a teacher's students were largely influenced by the Nationalist Party, the Communist Party and the nationalist factions in political thought. At that time, the KMT's 'Kuomintang Daily' (its supplement is 'Consciousness'), the Communist Party's Guide, and the Nationalist Lion Lion Lion Weekly were sold on campus. At that time, the ideological struggle in the school was the frequent debate in the poster between the Communist Party and nationalist, communist and nationalist students. I am determined to pursue academic research, I am not interested in politics and have not participated in any political party because of the influence of Leung Kai Chao. \\nAs a young man taught by my father, I usually read novels in addition to scriptures and ancient texts, such as 'Talking Zhai', 'Water Margin', 'Three Kingdoms' and so on, thus cultivating my strong interest in literature. At the time of reading in Kaifeng, many literary groups have been set up in our literature literature, such as literary research societies, creation societies, and later the language and filament society. I subscribe to the Novel Monthly, Literary Weekly, Creation Weekly, and more. My interest in reading was quite broad. In addition to literary works, I also looked at some academic works at that time, such as Liang Rengong's 'Icy Room Book', 'Liang Rengong Lecture Series', Hu Shi's 'Hu Shiwen', 'History of Chinese Language' (Hu Shi taught the history of literature at the Chinese language workshop in Beijing, PKU culture The Society published his speeches, titled 'History of Chinese Language and Literature'), and 'An Outline of Chinese Philosophy'. In literary terms, Lu Xun's novels, essays, prose by Zhou Zuoyan, Bingxin, Ye Shaojun, Wang Tongzhao, Lu Yin, and the works of Mrs. Guo Moruo and Yu Da, etc., are all to be viewed. After graduating from junior teachers, at a later stage, the new academic structure is divided into three disciplines: arts, science and arts. I was not interested in science. I was neither good at singing nor painting. I had to choose arts. At this time, there are several professional subjects, such as Chinese literature history and academic literature. \\nTeacher Guowen gave us some topics that are close to academic papers. I remember I wrote three nearly 10,000 words of papers, one on several genres in literature at that time, and the other is 'Willow and Literature.' Because I saw a paper on Birds and Literature in a publication that inspired me, I collected information about Willow and Literature. For example, in the Tang Dynasty Baqiao foliage custom to send others; In addition, from the characteristics of the willow itself, such as seeing the coming of the spring, see the flying sky, feel the return of spring, with willow branches flying in the wind, metaphor woman's slim and curly na, narrow and long metaphor of the woman's eyebrow, ancient poetry And the description and comparison of willow in the novel are searched and classified and ranked. \\nAfter writing the paper, I asked Guowen teacher Mr. Lu for comment. He looked very praised and encouraged me to contribute to the magazine. At his instigation, I sent the Student Journal issued by the Commercial Press Library. After a period of time, received the adoption notice, and sent me 5,6 yuan book voucher for payment. I remember in the cold winter, I ran to Dongdajie Business Printing Library Kaifeng Branch, and changed several books with a book voucher. The name of the book changed has been forgotten. Only the special issue of the Novel Monthly Bulletin, Chinese Literature Research Number, is remembered very clearly. This makes me work on writing and writing out the more exciting. \\nThe third paper, was written by Wu Yi Sanjun, a hometown of river great literature history. Professor Guo Shaoyu gave them a thesis entitled 'The Wenji and Martial Arts of the Han Guang Wu Emperor'. This man never wrote an academic paper, I did not know how to start on such a topic. Once I went to River University, he asked me to write for him, plus other fellow countrymen to advise him, I had to do it.. He sent to me a whole bunch of reference books, such as 'Post-Chinese Book' and 'General Study on Administration of Governance', and I spent a few weeks of effort, and finally wrote a paper of 6,7,000 words, and delivered a volume. In the case of this dude, it was finally prejudicial. As for the rating, he didn't tell me, and I was embarrassed to ask him. \\nIn 1927, the north of the army went to Henan, Kaifeng's middle school and teacher teachers came to a big merger, high school divided into arts, science, teacher training, I divided into teacher training. An essay contest was held at the whole school, and I and Shouzhijun Zhao were presented as representatives of the competition. As a result of the selection, Zhao got the first place. I was ranked second, and I got a few books, which impressed me very much, was Lu Xun's 'Legend of Tang Song' two volumes up and down. \\nHe was an English teacher of Kaifeng High School. He studied in the United States and studied theories of theatrical theory. Since I often contribute to his supplement, I also contributed to the journal by students from River University and one division. Once he suddenly invited a guest at a Muslim hotel called Dongxinglou in Gulou Street. Those invited were Baishou Yi, students from the Department of Literature and History of Henan University, Luo Mengcan, Zhang Yuan, Kaifeng teacher and my class Xu Zanwu, plus Chen, a total of six people. Chen Zhiche proposed to set up a literary society, publish regular publications and provide manuscripts. As for the printing of the publication, he alone bears the cost of printing the publication. Naturally everyone agrees very much. The name of the literary society, after discussion was set as Morningstar, meaning one said that few members, few fell like Morningstar, the second also contains the expectation that the dawn can come early. And the publication is named 'Morningstar Half Monthly' with the name of the company. \\nAfter the publication of the first issue of Morningstar and Half Monthly, the general reaction is not bad. Every member of the community has works, Zuan Wu writes a novel, a dream book is a poem, Zhang Yuan is a fairy tale, Ji'an, Shouyi and I write papers. My topic is a comment on Mao Dun's Trilogy. Publications have been issued 5 or 6 issues. By 1929, members of the community had changed greatly in their work and studies. Mr. Chen Foshi, editor editor, while studying abroad in the United States, was the new director of the drama department of Beijing Arts, Chen Yingxiong invited to Beijing art teaching full-time. Shou Yi went to Beiping and admitted to the Institute of History of Yanjing University, and I was also Zanwu. All graduated this year. In order to further education, they have to go to Beiping for further studies. So Morningstar Club members were scattered by one earth star. \\nMorningstar Club members came together again in the winter of 1929, when I was admitted to North Normal University and Zuan Wu admitted to Yan University, and we wanted to reinvent their flags and continue to issue publications. Mr. Ji Wenfu taught at the Peking University and the University of Women, and also expressed support for us. As a result, the publication was issued by Pak Shek, Peking University, and finally a issue was completed. Later, because everyone was busy with everyone's affairs, no one was able to work on the editing and printing of journals, and had to stop publishing, Morningstar was finally really dispersed. \\nIn the summer of 1929, after graduating from the first teacher in Henan province, I did not Ren fangqiu the south, I went to Beiping with the same class Xu Xuchang to prepare for the university examination. After going to Bec Ping, live in a small apartment on the beach and prepare for the exam. I enrolled in three universities, and finally accepted by the North Normal University. I went to the Department of Chinese Literature. The head of the department is Mr. Qian Xuantong, whom I always admire. His class for the first grade is 'Guoyin History', which is actually the history of the Chinese language. In the second grade, he offered two more courses for the Department of Chinese Literature, namely 'History of Scripture' and 'Speech Studies'. I heard all of these classes and made detailed classroom notes. \\nMr. Qian is the master of late Qing National Studies, Mr. Zhang Taiyan. In academic terms, Mr. Taiyan has inherited and developed the spirit and methods of Anhui Pai Dai (shock), Duan (Yujie), the two king (for the Sun, the father and son), governance, especially worthy of respect is his strength to clear, become an attempt to restore the Han nation's revolutionary spirit, Mr. Lu Xun called him 'a learned revolution. Home'. \\nWhen I listened to Mr. Money after a lesson, it was really 'Mauceton open', and the horizon was one of the eyes. He often uses concise language to summarize and elaborate on the academic achievements and unique abilities of some famous scholars of the Qing Dynasty. By contrast, the scholars of the same era are compared with the expertise of governance, and also from the longitudinal aspect, that is, from the development of the times, such as the Confucius and Hanru to and Song Mingru's views on the issue. In his history of scripture, his development was extremely ambitious and sophisticated. He talked about the 'truth and truth' of the Qing Dynasty Master Park Xueh, and the spirit of independent thinking, and the spirit of independent thinking. If the disciples have new discoveries on academic issues, they can rectify the teacher's assertions unequivocally when proving the mistakes of the teacher. Mr. Qian broke the view of the ancient people who adhered to the portal of 'family law' and 'division said', and was able to objectively and realistically give an impartial assessment to ancient scholars. For example, in the past, it is a fallacy to advocate ancient scriveners to attack this literary, and believe in the classics promoted by Han ancient man master Liu Xin. Zhang's sweeping Liu Xinda at the pole, to engraved a stamp, the text is 'Liu embedded private disciples'. But now the literary is trying to attack Liu Xin, believing that the classics promoted by Liu have been usurped and modified by him. Kang Youwei wrote the 'New School Pseudo-Examination', saying that the scriptures promoted by Liu Xin are preparing for public opinion for Wang Mangger. Because Wang Mangguo is 'new', so called Liu Xin promoted scripture as 'new'. Mr. Qian was familiar with ancient scriptures; later Mr. Qian asked the scripturer Cui Shi, and borrowed from Cui from Cui's 'New School Pseudoy Examination', and also read Cui's Historical Prospectives, and did not believe in ancient literature. After May Fourth, due to the influence of Western scientific methods, Mr. Qian completely broke the portals of the scriptures, and viewed scripture as a historical material, proving its authenticity from a historical point of view, thereby explaining the truth of ancient history. After listening to Mr. Qian's class in the 30s, I admire his scientific attitude. \\nThe other is Hu Shi. When I was in a division, I read his writings such as 'Papers', 'An Outline of Chinese Philosophy' and 'History of Chinese Literature'. When I went to the North Normal University, Hu taught at Peking University and taught 'History of Ancient Thought'. In order to listen to his class, I went to the Hall of the Second Courtyard of Ma Temple to hear his lecture once a week. I think from the money and Hu two people, I learned the methods and attitudes of governance. To express his faith in them, name my fasting of only two or three square meters, and asked my best friend Luo Jun Dream Book to write it, affixed above the door of the study. \\nIn 1930, I was still in the first year of college, I accidentally received a copy of Yaoyue's series of papers selected by Tongcheng. From Tang Song eight families, Li Ming Dynasty, Hou Fangyu, Wei Xi, Wang Yaofeng, until Fang, Yao, Mei Zengliang, Zeng Guofan, and finally Wu RuLun, a total of 18. I used his chosen famous artist as a clue, read through the collection and proofread with the original book and the lead-printed handouts. According to my rough literary theoretical level, the papers of these ancient literary artists were analyzed, compared and evaluated, and written about 40,000 papers, 'Thesis of Ancient Literature', published in No. 1, Volume 1 of the National Studies Series, North Normal University. This can be said to be a hard academic paper I wrote after I went to college. Today, although relatively shallow, the arguments and opinions of ancient writers on the creation and criticism of ancient writers are still paralyzed, and can be factual, and try to explore their causes. \\nIn the second grade, I participated in the editorial work of the National Studies Series and edited Volume 1, Issue 3. In this issue, I published my long test book and comment papers, including 'Yuan Zhonglang Mentorship Examination', 'Yuan Zhonglang Biography' and so on. In addition, 'Biansai poet Wu Hancha Review' was published in Beiping's 'New Morning News' supplement. \\nIn 1932, I was admitted to the Institute of Chinese Studies at Peking University. After admission, I selected the research topic 'Yuan Bai Research', and the mentor is Mr. Shen Yin Mo. At that time, the Institute was in the Third Hospital of Peking University and because of the system was not sound and did not attend classes. Only graduate students had contact with the mentor themselves. I only sent letters to Mr. Shen several times. Soon he took up the position of Director of Education Department of Hebei Province and went to Tianjin, and he had no contact since then. \\nIn 1933, I graduated from university to Luoyang Henan province fourth teacher teaching. By 1935, suddenly received a notice from the Peking University Research Institute, saying that the Institute had been changed to a research institute, and that the original graduate students had to go to school to study, otherwise they would have to be de-listed. So I only got to study and lived in the Tingsi Building of the Peking University Three Courts. The school still favors us, one house per person, there is nothing to interfere. At this time, my paper title has been changed to 'Yuan Zhonglang's Study', and instructed the teacher as Zhou Zuo, because he has always recognized the sketch of the late Ming public security faction. At that time, Badaowan Zhou House I went to somehow many times, borrowed books from the mentor and asked questions. (Zhou Zuoren's pseudonym), The old man has always been amiable and approachable to young people, without the shelves of scholar celebrities. By the summer holiday in 1936, the paper was completed and approved by a jury committee and allowed to participate in the defence. At that time, the defense committee was composed of five members, chairman Hu Shi, deputy chairman Zhou Zuoren, Luo Changpei, and invited two out-of-school experts, both professors at Tsinghua University, Chen Yinke and Yu Pingbo. The Committee voted by secret ballot, and my reply was adopted as a whole. \\nGraduation thesis 'Yuan Zhonglang Research' content is divided into two parts: one, year spectrum, two, literature. At the time of publication, it is divided into two parts. The upper series discusses, the next chronological spectrum. This paper explores the longitudinal thoughts and origins of Zhonglang, studied his relationship with Li Zhi and his relationship with the Taizhou school in Wang Xue, and then made a microscopic analysis of Zhonglang Thought. \\nYuan Zhonglang's literary theory was reproducible at that time. In order to clarify the innovative nature of Zhonglang's literature theory, the two retro movements in the Ming Dynasty, namely, he Li and Wang Li's retro, can we have a deeper understanding and evaluation of the revolutionary significance of Zhonglang's literature. Secondly, the theory and proposition of the literary innovation of Nakaro were elaborated in a more systematic way, and a general comment was made on the opinions of the author of the time, thus explaining the influence and influence of the so-called public security as a genre of literature at the time. Through this paper, you can see the clues of the development of innovation and retro factions in the struggle from Ming Dynasty Ho Li until May Fourth, in Chinese literature. \\nOnce the paper is completed, give it to the instructor for review. The mentor review is then sent to the members of the defense committee organized by the hospital for review. Among the members, Professor Luo Changpei saw the most carefully. He proofread the citations and the original text in the paper. There were discrepancies, all written in Kai as small rectangular blocks on the top of the paper. Soon the thesis defense was passed smoothly. Huang Tianpeng (Huxian, Sichuan people), who graduated from literature at the same time, was titled 'Han Yubiography'. He studied history by Zhang Hongxiang and Sheng Dairu. Their mentors were Professor Meng Sen, an expert in Qing history. After the reply, several of our graduates invited President Jiang Menglin and his wife Tao Tseng-lin, director of the Literary Institute, Hu Shi, mentor Zhou Zuo, Meng Sen, and the Secretary of the Institute Lu Caicheng to eat a meal at Sun Yat-sen Park. \\nAfter graduating from the Institute, I did not consider looking for a job in Beiping, I returned to Luoyang to teach. \\nFebruary 1940, introduced by friends, received the appointment of the Department of Literature and History of Henan University, the title of lecturer. After receiving the offer, considering that Heda is in Tantou, Songxian County, the situation there is still unclear. After consulting with cousins in Luo Shi as a music instructor, I decided to use the winter vacation to send my family home first. After the Spring Festival, I went to the river alone. So with his wife and children, together with cousins, starting from Jianbei Village in Lushi County (1938 Henan Province Luoyang teachers moved to Lushi County Jianbei Village), dry road trek, go home. \\nAfter the Spring Festival, I left my wife and children in Lianggou in my hometown, and went to Tantou River in Songxian County. Mr. Ji Wenfu, Dean of Hedai University, and the head of the Department of Literature History was Mr. Zhang Sui-qing. Both were my first teacher when I was studying in the first teacher. When I got there, I received their meticulous care. The department allowed me to take two classes, one on the history of Chinese literature and the second is the selection of ancient prose. Literary history, I have taught in Loshi for several years and has written handouts. 'Prose selection' selected articles, mostly Wei Jin people's works, such as Ji Kang 'with mountain giant source', land machine 'Wenfu', Bao Zhao 'Wucheng Fu' and so on. Literary history is not printed handout, by students taking notes. Because this lesson is not taught for a long time, I can really say it is 'bearish.' After a lesson, the students reported that it was not bad, so they also stood firm. \\nIn 1941, according to the university's literary curriculum, the Department of Literature and History had a subject of 'Modern Chinese Literature and Practice', but it had not been opened, so the teacher discussed with me whether it could be opened by me. I agreed. In order to have this class, I cannot but prepare it fully. I often go to the Grand Library of Upper Temple River to review the papers and writings of journals and writers in modern literature from the May IV and 1930s and 1930s. He moved continuously after the outbreak of the war of resistance, and books moved along with it, and fortunately past journals and most books in modern literature were saved. The more important journals, such as New Youth, Trendy, Young China, and several literature groups in the early 1920s, such as the Literary Research Society's Novel Monthly Bulletin, Literary Weekly, Creation Quarterly, Creation Weekly, and Yoseji's 'Silken', Crescent's Crescent, Modern and Left Federation publications of the 30s, and the Monthly Literature, and Most of the nationalist publications such as the Contradictory Monthly were found. I started writing my 'History of Modern Chinese Literature' based on these journals, and later by Zhao Jiabi's New Department of Literature and a collection of poems by some writers. \\nLecture on the History of Modern Chinese Literature, written in teaching. In 1943, my friend Li Jing ran the Striker newspaper in Nanyang. He wrote to me and asked me to write articles to his newspaper. Originally submitted to a supplement to the newspaper, Dashin is a combination of professional, belongs to classical literature, and there are many critic writers and works. Some later went into my book 'The History of Chinese Literature'. My family is in Nanzao rural area, about 100 Huali from Nanyang. Usually, during those years of winter and summer vacation, I went home, Jing Zhi often asked me to go to the newspaper, write for him, and print secondary school textbooks. Because of the convenience of printing, the newspaper first printed my 'child production'. I made changes to the book in the first two years, republished at the Henan People's Publishing House, and changed the name 'Subproduction Assessment Biography'. The publication of 'Child Produce' attracted my interest in the publication of literary history. When I finalized the 'History of Modern Chinese Literature', I asked the brother Jing to print it. This book was published in May 1944 with 2,000 copies of the book, which was published earlier in the history of modern Chinese literature. \\nOn the basis of his own knowledge and understanding of literature, the cultural revolution (including the ideological revolution and literary revolution), and the development of Chinese literature in the early 1920s were specifically analyzed and elaborated. The lower volume of 'History of Modern Chinese Literature' was not published. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, I served as the Director of the Department of Modern Literature at the Department of Chinese Studies at Henan University, and continued to teach the history of modern literature. In 1956, I published the book 'Theories of Modern Chinese Literature', which is based on the original 'History of Modern Chinese Literature'. The difference is that, as a result of studying Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought, new positions, perspectives and methods have been used to re-examine and evaluate modern Chinese literature for more than 30 years after May Fourth. In recognition, it is more comprehensive than the original. The book was determined to be published in Henan People's Publishing House, which failed to materialize because I was mistaken as the right in 1957. However, the Correspondence Department of Henan University issued 5,000 copies, which have been distributed throughout the country, for the reference of comrades engaged in the teaching of modern literature at that time. \\nAfter the founding of the country, although I was dedicated to teaching modern Chinese literature and published papers in domestic journals, such as Shanghai's New China and Beijing's New Construction, and also wrote special articles, but since I also taught many years of Chinese literature history before the founding of the country, and have written all the more detailed Handout, so I can't forget about classical Chinese literature. In the early 50s, he published an analytical commentary on the history of Sima Qian and Pu Songling's 'Liao Zhai Zhihui' in 'Yangtze River Literature' and 'New Construction'. The latter, in particular, has attracted the attention of domestic classical literature. An analytical review of the article 'Liao Zhai' was published in full in English version of Chinese Literature and also in Russian journals. Later, he has published comments on Qu Yuan, Sima Qian, Tao Dian and 'Dream of the Red House'. In 1956, Yangtze River Literature Publishing House published my 'Theory of Classical Chinese Literature', which contains eight papers, about 70,000 words, commenting on Qu Yuan, Sima Qian, Tao Qian and other writers and works like 'Liaozhai' and 'Dream of the Red House', as well as criticism of Hu Shi and Wang Yao about Huang Zunxian. The evaluation of the question of the article. \\nAfter the founding of the country until 1957, it was a time when I was very productive in writing. The reason is mainly the initial mastery of the theoretical weapon of Marxism, so that the more familiar classical literature often has a different view from the previous one, so it can be unborn. For example, for Han Yu and Liu Zongyuan, the major authors of the Tang Dynasty ancient movement, past commentators defied Han and suppress Liu. This is because the feudal era literals are mostly adherents of traditional Confucianism. Han Yu's dominant thinking is mainly Confucian thought, he put forward the Dao-Tong in the original road, Kai-Song agent scientist Daotong said the first. In the Song Dynasty, Ouyang Xiu in ancient literature, Han Yu, and then Zeng Gong, Wang Anshi and Su's father and son engaged in ancient writing, to the Ming Dynasty there were eight families of Tang Song said. Until the Qing Dynasty came to light, until the Qing Dynasty of the Qianlong period, Fang Bao, Liu Daqu, Yao Nai were dedicated to ancient Wen, they admired Korea, Europe, and Han became the Chinese ancient language. Liu Zongyuan, because of the old Buddha factor in his mind, was slander by the Confucian later. From a new point of view, I analyze the differences and similarities of the articles of Han and Liu, and I think Liu is a materialist. This can be seen very clearly from his article with Liu Yuxi. On the idea of Xunzi materialism in the last year of the Warring Power, as well as Wang Zhongren in Han Dynasty, he wrote articles such as 'non-Mandarin'. In these respects, he is much more sensible than Han. Secondly, from their political attitude, Han Yu said in the 'original road' that the relations between the Jun, the minister and the people set the theoretical basis for the feudal supreme rulers in the exploitation of the people, so he was praised by successive feudal rulers, and this situation continued until the late Qing Dynasty. After returning to the country with the influence of Western democratic ideology, he wrote an article on 'Breaking Korea' in order to promote Western democracy. Immediately be cynical by the big bureaucrats of the Qing government, and is perilous This shows that Han Yu's position in the eyes of successive feudal rulers is quite sublime. With a little criticism, the rulers believe that the critics are a big inverse, and they will immediately ask the sinners. As for Liu Zongyuan, in his article 'Sending Xue Cunyi', he clarified the relationship between officials and the people, saying that officials are to the people, they are servants of the people, and are by no means the people's master or master. The idea of democracy was indeed a rock-breaking view at the time. Because of this thought, when he was relegated to Yongzhou, he was able to write the Snake Catcher's Call for the oppressed and exploited people. Therefore, at the end of my paper, on the evaluation of Han and Liu, I propose to analyze and compare them from three aspects: (1), from the quality of the two people, Han is better than Liu; (2), from the world view of the two people, Han is also inferior to Liu; (3), from the creation, the two people have advantages and disadvantages. In general, feudal literary assessments of them in the past were unfair and should now be reversed for Liu. This article was published in the 6th issue of 'New Construction' in 1957, and then selected in the Commentary on Ancient Chinese Prose. \\nHowever, the good view is not long. In 1957, the Communist Party of China was rallying, encouraging people outside the party to help the party rectify the wind. Soon, that began"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": " to reverse the right. I was appointed a chairman of the Kaifeng City Committee of the China Democratic League early this year. Therefore, I participated in a conference on the expansion of propaganda work of the Henan Provincial Committee of the CPC. After the meeting, I was invited to participate in a series of symposia. At the beginning of the fight against the right, Hao Shiying, a propaganda member of the NLD Henan University branch and teacher of the Education Department, given his positive opinion to the party members, the school party committee designated him to the right. Because I was the chairman of the Kaifeng Municipal Committee of the NLD and had more contacts with Hao in the past, I thought that his actions were planned behind the scenes. At that time, the NLD Central Committee came out of the chapter (Bojun), Luo (Longji), coalition. Wang Yizhai, chairman of the NLD Henan Provincial Committee, became the great right in Henan. So some people think that 'the upper beam is not right down the Liang crooked'. Since the leadership of the NLD central and provincial NLD has emerged from the great right, then the head of the NLD municipal committee committee can still be unaffected by them? So I collected my remarks in the revelation, and I was not spared. By the beginning of 1958, the official announcement of the opinion on my treatment was put on me, put on me the hat of the right-wing, doing labor, no longer taking classes, and being isolated among the masses. At this time, in addition to reading Chairman Mao's writings, he is constantly writing personal thought checks. Scientific research simply can't talk about it. In 1958, I was taken off the right hat at the Chinese Department of Henan University. \\nThe publication of the article was greatly affected by being mistaken for the right at one time. I wrote 'Theories of Modern Chinese Literature', Henan People's Publishing House has decided to publish, and the results are done. In domestic journals, the situation has been opened, written academic papers are no longer a problem in publishing, but after 1957, it has become impossible. It was not until 1964 that I published several academic papers in my journal, such as 'Wu Jingzi's Academic Thought', 'From the Rebellious Thought of Rebellious Thought in the Red House Dream to Li Zhi's Rebellious Thought', and 'Gong Dingan Literature Theory'. By 1982, the first book of Chinese Classical Literature on Qu Yuan, Sima Qian, and Peach Blossom Source, Liaozhai and other articles published later on 'Rulin's Foreign History', 'Dream of the Red House' and the commentary on Taiyan academic thought and criticizing Hu Shi 'Chinese Literature for Fifty Years'. A collection of papers of classical Chinese literature, about 250,000 words, published by Zhongzhou Calligraphy and Calligraphy and Calligraphy House. . \\nIn 1964, I also wrote a paper on Yuan Zhonglang's Literary Theory and Creation, and sent to Beijing New Construction, because I have published several more quality papers in this publication in the past. This time, I think of the school (then he University renamed Kaifeng Normal College, in August 1979 changed its name to Henan Normal University and restored the name of Henan University in May 1984), Journal has published my paper, then it is adopted, there will never be a big problem. Certainly, soon received a letter from the editor of the publication, saying it had been adopted, and then sent a clear sample. I was full of thinking that this was no problem. Who knows that after the new issue of the publication is printed, there is no one of my articles. This must be because the publication wrote to school to understand my situation, knowing that I was 'hat-picking right', so the original printed article was abandoned. This hit me a lot, and since then, no more contributions to the outside. In 1966, when the Cultural Revolution began, my old teacher from the old society was labelled as 'reactionary academic authority,' and after being criticized, engaged in labor. Later after Lin Biao's Order No. 1, I went along with other teachers and students to work in Zhuyang Town, Lingbao County, Yuxi, and went back to Kaifeng for almost a year. Then went to the forest farm in Dongqi County, Henan, and later went to the Weishi Farm. We did not return to school until 1972 on the eve of recruiting workers and peasants. At that time, the leadership assigned me as 'Lu Xun's Choice' class, I thought that Beijing understood how Beijing universities were preparing to teach this course, and the leaders approved me to go to Beijing. After going to Beijing, I went to Peking University, Normal University, People's Congress, and Ren fangqiued the experts who studied Lu Xun to learn how they chose articles and how they taught them. After coming back, in the first class of workers and peasants enrolled, I served as a lecture of 'Lu Xun Works Selection'. According to the students, it was quite successful. Later, I taught this course to the two grades that continued to be enrolled. Over the years, I wrote some articles on the thoughts and works of Lu Xun, which was published by the Shaanxi People's Publishing House. \\nIn September 1976, Mao Zedong died. In October, the Communist Party of China smashed Jiang Qing's counter-revolutionary group. Soon, the CPC Central Committee issued instructions to correct the wrong cases, and the right, which I was mistaken in 1957, was completely corrected. He served as a member of the National Committee of the CPPCC and vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of Kaifeng City People's Congress. In schools, he served as the head of the Chinese language department. My book publishing house dare to print. Since then, I have published 'Liao Zaizhi Alternative Talk', 'Proceeds of Classical Chinese Literature', 'Lu Xun Shansan', 'Research of Yuan Zhonglang', 'Writers of Modern Chinese Literature', 'New Sources of Chinese Literature', 'Biography of Subproduction', and recently published by my editor. History of Modern Chinese Literature. \\nFrom the late 1970s to the 1980s, I changed the direction of literary research, which was the shift from modern literature to modern literature. \\nMy first writing in modern literature began in the 40s. The first part in the History of Modern Chinese Literature, which I wrote at that time, was 'Literature at the end of the Qing Dynasty', but it was relatively simple to speak, and the understanding still remained on the appearance. By the mid-50s, as Mao Zedong launched a campaign to criticize Hu Shi, I chose to criticize Hu Shi's '50 Years of Chinese Literature'. Hu Shi, this article was written at the invitation of the 50th anniversary of the 'Declaration' Pavilion, which falls within the scope of modern history. It is important to criticize Hu Shi's position, views and methods without understanding the literary phenomena he criticized in his article, and read the works of various genres and related literature. From the study, Hu Shi's view of history is a heroic view of mentalism, his position is the landlord's bourgeois, literary, naturalism and formalism. Qihu's manuscript of about 35,000 words was originally published in the opening issue of Kaifeng Normal University Journal, and then included in the Collection of Chinese Classical Literature. \\nSince I published articles that criticize Hu Shi, the head of the department intends to give me a lesson on 'Modern Literature History'. But at that time, the teaching plan of higher education institutions did not include this course and was not open for a long time, but it drew attention to my research in modern literature. The authors and works of this period were later studied in a more systematic way, and several articles were published in domestic journals on the author's comments of this period. From Gong, Wei, Kang, Liang, to Zhang Taiyan, a total of 18, namely Gong Zizhen, Wei Yuan, Huang Zunxian, Yan Fu, Kang Youwei, Tan SiTong, Liang Qichao, Zhang Binglin, Liu Shu, Liu Shu, Wang Guowei, Wu Woyao, Zeng Pu, Li Boyuan, Liu En, Qian Xuantong and Hu Shi. It was later edited as 'Modern Chinese Literary Writers', published by Henan People's Publishing House in March 1984. \\nAs a result of the study of modern Chinese literature, it went back to late Ming literature and pushed down to the May Fourth Literature Revolution, bringing nearly 300 years of Chinese literature and academic thought to a more systematic study and research. I think that Li Zhi, late Ming, is a great revolutionary in the history of Chinese academic thought. In the era of feudal rule, he first criticized Cheng Zhupai Science, and then boldly criticized Confucius, saying that Confucius should not be regarded as a criterion for judging whether or not. Such rhetoric at the time was truly unbelievable. As a result, the feudal ruling class was finally arrested and committed suicide in prison. \\nPublic security three Yuan, Zongtao, Hongtao, Zhongdao brothers, have all former teacher Li Zhi, especially Hongtao, the most appreciated by Li Zhi. Since their brothers were liberated under the influence of Li Zhi, their thoughts were liberated, so on the literature, led by Zhonglang, oppose the retro of the seven sons. Zhong Lang advocates literary creation on the content to 'lycribe spirits', in the method to 'letter to the wrist direct', anti-attack, the main original. Coupled with them at that time, such as Tao Wangling, Lei Ho Si, Jiang Jin, etc., a literary innovation movement was formed, so the stale of the creative culture of attack changed. Qian Qianyi, the leader of the Ming literature altar, in his series of 'series of dynasty poems', praised the merit of Zhong Lang at that time, said: 'Zhong Lang's argument, Wang Li Zhi cloud swept, so the talents of the world, began to know the mind, search the wisdom, to mimic the disease of Tu Ze, its great power.!' \\nThe anti-feudal ideological revolution advocated by Li Zhi converged with the repetitive literary innovation advocated by Yuan Zhonglang, the public security faction, and formed the culmination of the late Ming cultural revolution. Under the influence of this trend of progressive thinking, in the Chinese literary altar, from late Ming to Qingzhong leaves, the golden age of opera and novels, such as Tang Xianzu's 'Peony Pavilion', Hong Sheng's 'Church of Growth', Kong Shangren's 'Peach Fan', the latter such as the Late Ming Feng Menglong and Ling's 'Three Words', 'Second Shot', Chingpu Songling's 'Liao Zhai Zhiyi', Wu Jingzi's 'Foreign History of Rulin' until Cao Xueqin Qianlong Period 'Dream of the Red House' and Li Ruzhen's 'Mirror Edge'. We analyze the content of these outstanding works, all in line with the innovation of late tomorrow. They oppose traditional feudal rituals, feudal hierarchies, advocate freedom of marriage between men and women, expose criticism and unreasonable discipline, and the oppression and exploitation of the people by feudal officials. \\nThis democratic ideology, which further pursues equality and freedom, permeates with the Western bourgeoisie democratic ideology imported into China by Qing and Zhongye, confirms each other, and has formed a surging trend, resulting in a movement of literary improvement advocated by late Qing Liang Qichao. But because of the incomplete anti-feudal and repetitive literature, it was only May Fourth that a great cultural revolution had erupted. \\nBased on the above analysis, I decided to trace the origins of the May Fourth Cultural Revolution back to late Ming. So I wrote eight papers, namely: Li Zhi and Late Ming Thought Liberation and Literary Innovation Movement, 'Yuan Zhonglang, Advocate of Chinese Literary Innovation in the Early 17th Century', 'Culture of Late Ming' Innovation Movement and Chinese Literature in the 17th and 18th centuries, 'The Back Way of the Qing Dynasty Park Xuexer' Zhu Si and Advanced Literary Concept, 'The Rise, Development and Depletion of Tongcheng faction in the Qing Dynasty', 'The Input of Late Qing West and the Development of Modern Chinese Literature', 'The Thought Revolution of Late Qing, Qing-Kong and May Fourth Literature Revolution', 'Late Qing Literary Innovation and the May Fourth Literature Revolution'. These eight articles, a collection of books, in the name of 'The Source of New Chinese Literature', was published by the Henan People's Publishing House in 1986. \\nIn the academic and literary thought of the Qing Dynasty, the cultural innovation movement, coupled with the input of Western studies, has led to the literary improvement of the late Qing dynasty, and finally led to the outbreak of the May Fourth Cultural Revolution. In Chinese academia, the source of the May Fourth Cultural Revolution has not been explored and discussed in the past. I think this is quite personal and unique in my lifelong writings and is a pioneering work. The number of copies of this book is only 2,000 copies, and the number of readers in society is still small, but I think my opinion, will certainly be endorsed by the general intellectuals in the future. \\nIn 1982, the first national seminar on modern literature was held in Kaifeng. I read out my paper 'Yun Jing's Ancient Literature and Its Relationship with Tongcheng'. Lu Xingki, editor of Literary Heritage, attended the meeting, after which he took away the article and published in Issue 3 of 1984. \\nThe Second National Symposium on Modern Literature was held in Hangzhou in 1984. Comrades at the meeting felt that higher education schools were going to offer a modern literary history class. First of all, there was a more detailed history of Chinese literature that reflected the new achievements of the subject. So I asked Shanghai Normal University Wang Xinggen and South China Normal University Zhong Xianpei to discuss the writing of the book together with his fellow comrades. It is advisable, and briefly discuss the setting of the chapter. A compendium was drawn up by caring and collating. In March 1986, a book writing conference was held at Heddau, at which I was selected as editor-in-chief, and composed of participants from several universities in the country, appointed the Editorial Board of Caring and Wang Xinggen, Zhang Zhong as the editorial board of the book, and assigned the chapters of the book to several comrades involved in the preparation of the book. After the completion of the book, it was handed to Henan University Press for publication. \\nIn 1986, the editorial department of the Shanghai Bookstore was preparing a Department of Modern Chinese Literature. Fan Quan, the editor-in-chief of the store, informed me that I was the editor of the essay volume. I answered and promised. Soon, Fan Quan went to Kaifeng to discuss editorial matters. The essay volume will have more than 100 authors' representative works selected in four volumes of 500,000 words each. It was agreed that an editorial board was set up by the selected staff of my organization. After two years of effort, the selection process was largely completed. I wrote the first draft of the introduction. Following the addition and revision by Ren Liangzhi, the revised introduction has been sent to the Shanghai bookstore. The book will also be sent shortly. \\nIn addition, I wrote the paper on the study of Lu Xun (especially during the centenary of the birth of Lu Xun in 1981), as 'Two episodes of Lu Xun's dispersion', and I also edited the papers written in recent years on classical literature as 'Series of Chinese Classical Literature'. The former has not found an accepted publishing house, the latter has been handed over to Henan University Press . \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"}

The person had had a deep influence on the idea of trustee bandits while studying in Wendian peripheral organization 'Reading Club'. Although the public security organs had a critical education treatment, Ren had always insisted on the banditry position and attacked the party and the opposition party.] \\nFirst, reactionary arguments put forward by Ren hongshuo\\nThe bourgeoisie right is reactionary, and Yugoslavia as an international spy center, are all analyzed from trends, so it is persuasive? \\nWhat differentiates a party as a working-class party? In particular, what differentiates the non-sectarian party? \\nWhy can't dogmatism lead the proletarian cause to victory? \\nWhy is democratic centralism one of the nature of the party? \\nHow do we explain our society step by step towards communism (take old society than?), \\nThe system is not universal, there are still people who are wrong like Stalin under socialism, too pessimistic?! \\nThe slogan of the political first is permanent? Or the transition period? Is the production of substances more important? \\nIs imperialist aggression realistic and reasonable? African countries are governed by feudal, rather imperialism? \\nIf a comrade's absolute trust is often impossible, specific conditions of trust, what is the feelings? Long live shout is not enthusiastic anymore!? \\nBelieve that the masses are right on any occasion? And how to master? \\nWhat kind of attitude should the principle of remuneration be treated in order to make socialism and not capitalism? \\nIs obedience blind when a person does not appreciate the intent of his superiors? Is independent thinking arrogant, will there be revenge against it? \\nIt is too cold that the party only realizes the opposition in the movements in order to rule. Once they obey the party's rule, it will no longer matter how the minds of these people change? \\nHow can people abandon individualism? \\nSecond, the small print newspaper 'about my view on the whole wind':\\nThe reason for bureaucracy is that political parties do not distinguish:\\nThe party actually replaces the government's execution: 'In fact, it has become the way in which the majority of party organizations are led-by party representation:\\nIn Ren hongshuo's opinion, the meaning of the party is: 'Party members can only listen to the party, the party organization decides everything... so they cannot understand the demands of the masses. They sit in the office to issue a notice and make a decision, while those with unstable positions learn the KMT and ride on the head of the people.' \\nAnd his approach to these problems is 'to rectify some fundamental problems'. With so many spears, who can take on it in the name of a person? I think the wind is too weathery. \\nThe indiscriminate conclusion of party and government is summarized from the following special examples. \\na. Allocation of work for graduates: 'The assignment of the work of graduates of higher schools and personnel movements are entirely determined by the department secretary and party branch committee, but the mentors who are trained in the business do not have the right to participate in the decision on the assignment of work' 'Allocation of work party members to take care of much and the masses take care of, everyone has Opinion 'Hard work, but it's a bureaucracy.'\\nB. philosophical learning is the party decided to stop. \\n(c), The head of the party member is incompetent, and the party decides to dismiss his office, and then through or without government formalities. \\nThe idolarization of Marxism is the root cause of dogma:\\nUnderstanding of the role of Marxism: 'The ruler must be ruled' 'Will Marxism, today as the ruling ideology, become dominion tomorrow?' 'Lenin negated Marxism, so that Lenin became Marx', 'The Eighth Party Chapter of the Communist Party of China places special emphasis on the development of Marxism. \\nThe consequences of dogmatism are: 'What we hear and see in today's big reports, small reports, textbooks, and philosophical papers are considered to be the old set of 'clichés', and we gradually change from talking with love to not talking, and gradually from not talking to not thinking. We can only say what Marx has said, we can only think of what Marx has already thought about. The problem, because dogmatism only allowed us to believe in the nineteenth century Marx, 'The idolarization of Marxism is the root of dogmatism. \\nHis way to overcome dogmism is: 'Lenin and our party statutes emphasize not to idolate Marxism, so I advocate to bring down the 'authority' of Marxism. In public opinion, the use of Marxism is equally valid as quoting Hegel and Russell, as long as everyone says. Ruling only on the basis of such equality can there be a hundred people to compete for their names and flowers. 'When publishing something from the bourgeois school in the press, don't make a tough statement, read here as the object of Marxist criticism', 'Politics classes should be chosen freely. \\nReactionary remarks written by three hongshuo\\nTrotsky is Lenin's comrade, who does not seek practical theorist, has personal ambitions and stereotypes and becomes anti-socialist. (After all, the Soviet Union is the public ownership system can give up this position?), But there is no reason to be spies, only because of Stalin's retaliation, the material may be fake. \\nChina's 'theory' of brigsters is better than the Party, but the Party Central Committee is afraid to admit itself mistakenly not to accept it, (social nature, labor and labor), actually change it secretly. \\nThe lower layers of the bandits are good, and it is based on stereotypes to force them to change their views (some things are naturally easy to change). \\nThe Soviet Union is a state of public ownership, but politics still maintains the form of domination and domination, ideological consciousness in the service of the people, the loss of stand riding on the people, Stalin, Belia, Molotov, and so on; ideological education will finally be changed from top down or bottom-up Revamped in order to achieve a true commune form of organization. \\nThe ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the worst. There is Stalin's personal worship, great power ideology, personal worship is to rule within the country, power dominates the whole world, and reign content is to promote socialism without affecting his individualism, (mainly economic.), \\nInternationally flattering the core of the Soviet Union is the Stalinist. To have a core, the core of the current power must be abolished. \\nStalin forced retirement from his old cadres and, after his death, led Marinkov, the youngest and most popular Stalin, to become president. \\nKhrushchev and other firm, but timid, Stalin did not dare to fight back in his life, did not harm socialist interests give rise to a sense of responsibility? \\nMy country also says that Stalin has scored seven points, one is not a good explanation of how he worshipped Stalin before and the other by Stalin elements. \\nKhrushchev was timid, implying China to say this. \\nThe Communist Party of China wants to go to socialism, which I am advocating, but how socialist politics still has the content of struggle. \\nParty members are: bad, shaken, enthusiastic, firm. \\nBad: Individualism forms sectarian forces. Liu Shaoqi is probably the representative, not in favor of the emblem, but is the central leader. The People's Daily is occupied by these people. Therefore, this part of the people is historical inevitable. Unfortunately, anti-right struggles have not cleaned them. \\nThe party often admits that small mistakes do not recognize big mistakes, demands that they deny them completely, and put on the head of the time the inescapable responsibility and never involve the responsibilities of existing leaders. This style of 'bad' plays a fundamental role. \\nThe shaken: anti-town, anti-bourgeois, anti-bourgeois, anti-landlords, anti-right interests can participate well with them, but the personal interests of private interests can not be overcome. They can only go through the current political, not commune style socialism. \\nPassionate: Someone leads very well, or 'but' \\nThere is no democracy within the party. Everything is determined by leading several people, the firm has absorbed the opinions of the masses. Under pressure from the collective leadership, the undetermined ones enter the individual leadership that may be imported. Democracy itself is not important, but the conservative forces within the party must be cleaned by democratic movements. \\nThe party needs to be reformed, but it does not have to overthrow, can be reformed on the original basis, so I think I can't enter the regiment, and I can't enter the party in the future is still a matter of shame. \\nChairman Mao has a right sentiment: Hu Feng's 'flower' can be put, coexist for a long time, one will not kill either. He sent troops late during the liberation of Jiang against Japan, but it was not an individualist role, because it was tested by the pre-revolutionary congresses, after the long March and anti-Japanese events, after being tested by the long March and anti-Japanese events, simple and humble after liberation. \\nMarxinism had a tactical and therefore theoretical development in Lenin and Chairman Mao's era, but there was no unique development, which was virtually impossible, and revolutionaries could not be able to act as theoreticians. \\nThe materialism philosophy today only flattering Stalin, which is the reason for the pause, idealism may peak, but today it is not possible to stimulate materialism but accept this race today. My view of communism is a trustee to the bandits, and the party has not given me that. \\nYugoslavia is in the sense of the commune, which is temporarily usable and perpetuated, and this form of domination and domination inevitably leads to bureaucracy and, ultimately, to social change. \\nThe events show that the working class has called for social change, but it is by no means at the expense of betraying socialism, but by restructuring leadership, which is a historical trend. \\nThe wind of our country can also be seen as a reflection of this historical law. \\nLife is to die for a revolution, but there must be a 'revolutionary certificate'. \\nIt is a matter of course to suffer with workers and farmers, but taking a car by the head's family is a manifestation of corruption, and I should also have a personal intention. \\nIndividualism must be considered, but can often not be satisfied, such as the 'revolutionary certificate' in the film insistence on the soldiers immediately, but finally to the sudden sacrifice is natural. \\nBusiness and politics unify only within a certain range, capitalist talents, because different politics invade business throughout their life. Socialist talent is wide, because the working population has many opportunities for education and fewer people with political ideology education decadent. \\nThe construction of our country encourages the exchange of life for money, robbing jobs, fighting... and so on because poverty is necessary to do so, but it is too cruel. \\nEmphasize the party party in life to cover sectarianism. \\nIt is still impossible to rule out people within the Party by chance (by chance), and ability to mix into the Party. They are shavers and bad elements. They can use distorted theories to achieve personal goals. Liu Yicheng marries Wang Zhaoming is a false public and private.
