'In the current socialist camp countries... democracy or purpose.' 'Democracy is the basic requirement of the working people of socialist society.' 'For these few leaders (referring to Comrade Politburo), democracy is sufficient; for the majority of the working masses, rice, democracy still lacks real guarantees.' (Junmin Pan junmin, Department of Journalism, Renmin University of China)\\n'The one-sided emphasis on the results of collectivism has inhibited the development of individuality and a group of young people with characteristics. Under this educational system, they have been grind round, dead, and rushed out are very few. Lin Xiling is the one.' (Junmin Pan junmin, Department of Journalism, Renmin University of China)\\n'The issue of socialist democracy. After Lenin's death. The problem has ceased to develop for 30 years. We believe that Stalin Gong's seven or three, the Soviet Union did not agree. The Soviet Union knows much more about Stalin than we do. We are so far away from the Soviet Union, and we don't know anything about Stalin. The thinking level of the Soviet Union is not lower than us. The Communist Party of China simply does not have to appear with an old attitude of peace, arrogance and self-esteem level is very high. \\nStalin's failure is not three or seven. A person who has a prominent genius, with a contribution can get people's worship, and this social phenomenon will also exist to communism. It is mentalism to bring down Stalin's problems to personal worship. \\nSince Stalin can take advantage of the Soviet system Hu (China's system is also possible, but Mao Zedong's quality is better than Stalin), it is clear that the system is problematic. \\nThe reason why the issue of socialist democracy stopped developing was the stumbling block of Stalin, and there was little logic in the 37-point statement. \\nDemocracy is not a means but an end, and it can only be said that it is a means when it has been struggled. Now democracy is not enough, it is incomplete. For the entire socialist camp, democracy is therefore an end, and there is no means. We want democracy for all, not that of that President, several members of the Politburo. They have a little bad to harm 600 million people. What is it called democracy?' (Junmin Pan junmin, Department of Journalism, Renmin University of China)\\n'Since Lenin's death, the issue of socialist democracy has ceased to develop in theory and in practice...\\nIn that country, democracy was not a means but should be the object of the struggle of the working people. Today we do not have democracy, democracy belongs only to a few people in the CPC Central Committee. All issues are up to them. The heads of organs of power at all levels are members of the Communist Party, and the Standing Committee of the People's Congress is a formalistic organ. \\nThe people's democratic dictatorship is actually a communist one-party dictatorship. This kind of dictatorship is contradictory to a country composed of industrial and agricultural intellectuals, and a joint dictatorship of workers, farmers and intellectuals should be established.' (Junmin Pan junmin, Department of Journalism, Renmin University of China)\\n'The deviation in our political system is to equate the proletarian dictatorship with the Communist one-party dictatorship.' Advocate for the establishment of a 'joint dictatorship of the working class, peasants and labour intellectuals.' (Material from Pan junmin Junmin, Journalism Department, Renmin University of China)\\n'All trials shall be held in public for the last time, and secret executions are prohibited. All criminals are given the right to appeal. Judges and jurors must be elected. They cannot be convicted on the basis of confessions and material evidence. (Junmin Pan junmin, Department of Journalism, Renmin University of China)\\n'A kind of class polarization based on the private ownership of communist political information is being formed.' (Junmin Pan junmin, Department of Journalism, Renmin University of China)\\n'Diplomatic work: Do not look at the face of the Soviet Union, to be fully equal to the Soviet Union. 'The socialist family headed by the Soviet Union,' this formulation should not be changed to 'with the Soviet Union as a pioneer... 'Viet Nam proposed 'headed by the Soviet Union, China...' We do not agree with, nor do we oppose, in fact, we should oppose this inequality.' (Junmin Pan junmin, Department of Journalism, Renmin University of China)\\n'Some departments and units... are forming a class polarization based on the possession of the political material of the Communist Party.' \\n'Organs, schools, groups, because party members are in the leading position, complex origin, more intellectual style and problems, science, culture, business level is low... so the relationship is tense, and heavy.' 'As long as they are organized into the party, whether or not they really join the party in ideology, such people enjoy the privileges of rapid promotion, high social reputation, and even getting married.' (Junmin Pan junmin, Department of Journalism, Renmin University of China)\\n'Chairman Mao's dialectical law is world-famous, but the verbal dialectics need to be consistent with actual practice.' (Junmin Pan junmin, Department of Journalism, Renmin University of China)\\n'To improve the inspection and inspection bodies, not the Communist Party ruling or the Communist Party inspection, so there is a great possibility of sheltering and involving the working masses to the Inspectorate.'

Who expected that Pan mou Yuliang, who had been recognized in Europe, was still questioned by many people after returning home, and forced her to leave again after 'fake paintings' and stigmatized art exhibitions. 'Culture China' moderator this wave came together with Tang Zhesheng, professor of the Faculty of Arts of Soochow University. \\nThe three things entrusted to Wang Shouyi before Pan mou Yuliang's death, why did Wang Shouyi complete only two? Finally, how did Pan mou Yuliang's work return to the motherland? \\nPan mou Yuliang's greatest wish when he was in France was to return to the motherland, but until her death, this wish could not be fulfilled. Fortunately, her paintings eventually returned to the motherland and, in a sense, her soul of painting returned. \\nReturning to the country to teach false paintings\\nModerator: Pan mou Yuliang sent her delightful 'Wine Fairy' and another nude painting to attend the Italian International Art Exhibition. Although there was no prize, it was distinctive, so it was striking. Shortly after that exhibition, her work was awarded at other exhibitions. \\nGuest: Yeah, got five thousand lira, for a while, the problem of hungry belly was solved at least temporarily. \\nModerator: A man who pursues art has supported himself by art. \\nGuest: Reaching this realm, we say she can be called the painter. \\nModerator: Sadly, when she returned home, she was said to be a liar, what happened? \\nGuest: In 1927, Liu Haisu went to Europe to meet Pan mou Yuliang, and invited her to say, 'Go home and go to my school to teach. Pan mou Yuliang was very happy, so in 1928, she came back to Shanghai. \\nModerator: I went abroad in 1921 and returned home in 1928. I thought that a controversial figure in the school had returned to his alma mater this time, changed her status, was a professor. Can she be accepted smoothly? \\nGuest: At the time she was on board to Shanghai, many of the teachers of Shanghai Meijie were to pick up at the pier, including Mr. Wang Jiyuan and Mr. Hong Ye. In the beauty school, it was a teacher at the beginning, and later became the head of the Western Painting Department. It was not only the teachers who welcomed her, but the teachers also held her first exhibition. The name of the exhibition was very loud, called 'China's First Female Western Painter Exhibition'. She became the Western painting industry at the time, it can be said not to be a leader, at least one of the eye-catching vanguards. \\nModerator: It seems that Pan mou Yuliang's return to his alma mater is also a hometown. But then how did those incidents arise? \\nGuest: There is a problem in this area. Some people in society, he always do not believe, saying that a prostitute, a concubine, actually can draw such a good painting. There is a lot of style in society. Some people also put forward an evidence that this painting must have been painted by Mr. Hongye. The reason is that Pan mou Yuliang gives Mr. Hung Ye money every month. In fact, Mr. Hung Ye had a relatively serious lung disease at that time, and the child had no job, so Pan mou Yuliang was giving grace. She took half her salary every month and sent to Mr. Hung Ye's home on time, so Mr. Hung Ye is very grateful to her. \\nModerator: Faced with such doubts, what should Pan mou Yuliang do? \\nGuest: This broke out. What happened? When she was about to hold her fourth exhibition in Shanghai, she took out some of her more beautiful works. At the press conference held before the painting exhibition, she had a problem, and a reporter actually stood up and asked her a question, 'Ms. Pan mou, these paintings are said to have been painted by others. You will give that person money every month.' The whole time was quiet, listen to her answer. Pan mou Yuliang did one thing at this time. She smiled, and then walked to a student who had mastered her paintings, borrowed his artboard, borrowed the color, in front of the reporter, in the face of the reporter, painted her own self-portrait, and she drew her own self-portrait. The face is a piece of applause. \\nModerator: Facts are better than eloquent. \\nGuest: But a cathedral professor was forced to paint on the spot to prove his innocence and humiliation. So Pan mou Yuliang's heart is really depressed. \\nModerator: This is the past. I think that those people who do not understand the painting have raised questions, Pan mou Yuliang endured the past. I'm afraid that what makes Pan mou Yuliang the most sad thing is that some of the insiders, especially her peers questioned her. \\nGuest: Yes, at this time, the Shanghai American College has come to many teachers. You Pan mou Yuliang, a woman from a prostitute, was also the head of the western painting department, how high are you? \\nModerator: No. \\nGuest: There was an opening session, and as a director she said, 'What are the opinions of the predecessors?' Some of our predecessors said: 'Our predecessors are no longer useful. Now all come from the outside, with foreign ink.' Pan mou Yuliang still endured, after all, she was a student. But one person actually stood up and said, 'What are you amazing? What are you doing as an official here, but our school is called 'Phoenix dead light, pheasant dominance. '' It's still ordering her prostitute. Pan mou Yuliang stood there without saying that he was slapped in a single note. This note slapped up, so to speak, she and the Shanghai American album broke. \\nModerator: This slapped very convincing, but he left the Shanghai Fine Arts College. The first shows that Pan mou Yuliang's personality is very strong. However, the second brings us a concern, ah, she left the Shanghai Meijiao, where should she go? \\nGuest: She wrote three letters. A letter to President Liu, who was far from Venice, resigned. The second letter, she was given to Mr. Wang Jiyuan, who presided over the work of Shanghai Meihua, said she wanted to go. The third letter was to Mr. Xu Beihong of Central University, promising to apply full-time at Central University. What do you mean, that is, I'm not going to cross two schools anymore. I came to you to work. \\nModerator: She is ready to go to Nanjing. Shanghai can't tolerate her, but can everything be peaceful when it comes to Nanjing? \\nArt exhibition stigmatized, family repression, jade helpless to go abroad again\\nModerator: Although Pan mou Yuliang is emotionally difficult to cut off the Shanghai US dictatorship, secular bias forced her to choose to leave, so she arrived in Nanjing. In fact, Pan mou Yuliang returned home and received an invitation from Xu Beihong, who was then the head of the Art Department of Central University, and hired her as a professor at the Faculty of Arts at CUHK. On school, Central University was one of the top national key comprehensive universities at that time, to be a professor was a dream for many people; on personal feelings, Xu Beihong was her brother in law and had trouble. On the family, Pan mouzanhua worked in the industrial department of the Nanjing government and could go to Nanjing for family groups. Round. Since there were so many benefits, why didn't she move to Nanjing at once. What was it hidden? \\nGuest: At that time, she couldn't leave her alma mater. There were Mr. Hung Ye, Mr. Wang Jiyuan, and many of her colleagues, especially where passion was burning years, so she couldn't do it. Another, very important reason, that is the contradiction between Xu Beihong and Liu Haisu. \\nModerator: Pan mou Yuliang is caught between the two of them. \\nGuest: Yeah, one is her teacher, one is her brother. \\nModerator: The gracious resentment between Liu Haisu and Xu Beihong, in the 1930s of the last century, was a major event in the country. The debate between the two people affected their loved ones, friends or paintings, and the impact was very far-reaching. Until after liberation, Premier Zhou Enlai specifically gave them two people. Make mediation between. \\nGuest: The problem was actually given to Pan mou Yuliang. Because one is my teacher, the other is my classmate, so how do they deal with their relationship? Both sides ask her to come. So she was just a bit hard on her own, running on both sides. However, the rush was over and she left Shanghai. \\nModerator: Nanjing is a new world for Pan mou Yuliang, so how did she live here? \\nGuest: In my opinion it is not a new heaven, it's her sad place. \\nModerator: Why do you say that? \\nGuest: She didn't think of her own. She thought she had come home. There were also CUHK, but the leading national colleges at that time, and her classmates were there, was also the center of politics and culture at that time, and there could be some heaven and earth to show herself, but Nanjing became a sad place for her. \\nModerator: How did this twists happen? \\nGuest: On January 28, 1936, she held a large-scale exhibition of paintings in Nanjing, which should be said to be a summary of her years. \\nModerator: What is her best work in this exhibition. \\nGuests: Two of the most striking paintings, one called Manpower Warrior, and one called 'Dazhong Bridge.' 'Manpower' this painting, its whole picture can be said to be a naked man, carrying a large stone, under the stone is a small grass, please pay attention to this time, 1936, just after the 9.18 incident, the Japanese began to invade China, so you can see, she is putting Japanese This aggression is seen as a stone, and the Chinese have to move this stone down as one of her wishes. \\nPresenter: This painting is very symbolic, so its shock is naturally extraordinary. Moreover, those who saw the original painting at the time said that the painting, the muscles and lines were drawn very carefully in place. Even Liu Haisu evaluated that this painting, giving people the feeling that it was very powerful. Guest: Yeah, so she was happy too. \\nModerator: This is one. What about Ochadashi Bridge? \\nGuest: 'Dazhong Bridge' painted the Dazhong Bridge here in Nanjing's Qinhuai River. In fact, Dazhong Bridge was built to commemorate the Zodiac Week at the end of the Ming Ming Dynasty. \\nHost: Because Zodiac was in the late Ming period, that was also a generation of Confucianism master. He then led the villagers to fight Qing and finally died in the Dazhong Bridge in Nanjing. \\nGuest: This painting, which was painted on the days before the 1.28 of her exhibition in 1936, was clear to her purpose. She told us that there was a national spirit, to have such a spirit of resistance. After reading the painting, the then Minister of Education of the National Government gave a thousand oceans, the Manpower Warrior, to set it off. \\nModerator: The so-called high price to buy. \\nGuest: Yes, in fact, not only do you buy this painting, I want to buy this spirit. \\nModerator: All this is a good thing for Pan mou Yuliang. \\nGuest: But the next day, she was stunned by opening the door of the exhibition. The man man, which has been set a thousand oceans, is not only broken by people with a knife, it also wrote a few words. \\nModerator: What? \\nGuest: It's called a prostitute's singing to the client. Why, because he was a male naked painting, so Pan mou Yuliang saw all stay. The entire exhibition was a mess, and some people also stole her paintings. (Wuyi three press: Chinese people's vicious, downstream, visible here.), \\nModerator: So what about the painting of 'Ochadu Bridge'? \\nGuest: 'Dazhong Bridge' is not there, so he said, Pan mou Yuliang was greatly stimulated. Pan mou Yuliang's life, there was one thing that always kept her off, and in the middle of the eyes of some people, she carried the cross of shame of a prostitute in the middle of her life. \\nModerator: The less you want to raise things, the more they want to keep up, that is to make you hurt at a time. This is a blow from the social side. \\nGuest: But one thing in the house just came out. Pan mouzanhua's big wife came. \\nModerator: It is the big wife, this is the main wife, this is in ancient and old society, for the concubine, this is a way to get rid of the bondage. There's this plot in the movie. \\nGuest: Although such a kneeling completed this etiquette, but the humiliation and pain in her heart are imaginable. \\nModerator: At this time, Pan mou Yu's conscience was uncomfortable, not to be understood in art, and returned home, I'm afraid to be subject to some repression. Under this double pressure, ordinary people can't really feel it.\\nGuest: At this time, France invited her to send paintings and open a painting exhibition. She left the country for the second time. Comes to France. \\nModerator: That time was in 1937, and a direct opportunity at that time was her participation in the art fair of nations to present her work. Unfortunately, 40 years after this time, she never returned. \\nModerator: In 1937, Pan mou Yuliang embarked on a cruise ship to France on the banks of Huangpu River and Pan mou Zanhua. In France, she is referred to as 'three no women', that is, not in love, foreign nationality, and no contract with a gallery. The first two good understanding,That is her loyalty to love and sincerity to the motherland,But this third point does not sign with the gallery means that there may be no fixed economic source,Because signing with the gallery is like now a star to find a broker,This is a fame thing,Why does she insist on not doing it? \\nGuest: It can be said that because of the independence of personality, it can also be said of the independence of art, but I think the main thing is that she does not value her own life, money is not so important, so she has lived in poverty in the middle of her life. \\nWhen she first went to France, she basically relied on selling a little painting, and then receiving social benefits. In 1960, she actually moved to a small town in France called Montparas. She herself lives in a small loft in the town, economically distressed. She doesn't have a separate studio, she treats her bedroom as a studio, and she almost doesn't go downstairs in that place for a day, painting. \\nModerator: Where is this like a big painter who has become fame, it's like an artist who continues to start a business in the bucket room. Let's look at the second article, there is a firm non-admission to foreign nationality. This is also a kind of stick ah. \\nGuest: Yeah, China and Europe were very different at that time. There is certainly no big problem with welfare above. But she just couldn't fit, why, had a Chinese heart. Since Pan mou Yuliang arrived in France, she always took her return to the country as a belief. This belief until her 80s, she still saw people who said I wanted to return home. \\nHost: Not only did she want to go back, Liu Haisu has always invited her back. Her former student, famous diplomat, Mr. Huang Zhen, also invited her back, but she never came back. Why? \\nGuest: The student who drifts abroad, he does not return home, how to return home, in addition to his beliefs, has a great relationship with some of our domestic political atmosphere. So, Pan mou Yuliang, from 1949 to 1951, she said to return home many times, but her belief was not very strong at that time because she felt she had not been so special. In 1958, she had a successful exhibition of art by a Chinese painter, Mrs. Pan mou Yuliang, in France, and she was ready to return home. \\nAt that time, someone showed her a newspaper. The newspaper said that China is engaged in a large-scale anti-right struggle, and the newspaper also named above that Liu Haisu has become a great right. Pan mou Yuliang in France first did not understand what the right was. Second, she simply did not know what concept Liu Haisu became a big right, so she wrote to Pan mou Zanhua. \\nIn her reply, Pan mou Zanhua told her that the right is the enemy, and said that now Liu Haisu is the right, so Liu Haisu is the enemy. Here is another sentence, he said, now Pan mou Mou is also a right-wing. So, Pan mou Mou is also an enemy. \\nModerator: This Pan mou Mou should be the son of Pan mouzanhua and Grandwife, the eldest son. \\nGuest: Yes. Seeing such a letter, Pan mou Yuliang thought in his heart, how Pan mou Mou also became an enemy. Liu Haisu later developed into what she would not dare to say, but Pan mou Mu she knew that they had lived in Nanjing for a while, at that time, they had a very good feeling. \\nModerator: It should be said that the period of life with Pan mou Mou was the most family atmosphere of Pan mou Yuliang's life. For that reason she had also painted paintings such as 'Father and Son', 'My Family' and so on, so looking at such a Pan mou Mou who grew up since childhood, has also become an enemy. \\nGuest: Yeah, look at the letter below, Pan mou Zanhua can speak. Say you are an old lady now, if the trek is very Lawton, the weather is cold, so say, don't return home for the time being. \\nModerator: This is cold weather is not pun ah? It seems that Pan mou Zanhua is still supporting and supporting Pan mou Yuliang with his own love. This may be a driving force for Pan mou Yuliang's subsequent climbing to the peak of art. Because in 1959 the Mayor of Paris awarded the 'Dore Prize' to Pan mou Yuliang, and announced that her statue of Daqian was collected by the Museum of Modern Art in Paris, which was the first collection of oriental women, an honour that was very important for her. \\nGuest: This is a very high honor, and Pan mou Yuliang is also very happy. She took a photo to Pan mou Zanhua that day, which says, 'Today, he won the Dole Prize from the University of Paris. Praise brotherhood deposit. Yuliang, April 27, 1959\\. At this time, Pan mou Yuliang, on the one hand, wants to get the praise from Pan mou Zanhua, on the other hand, she really wants to return home. But there was no return. \\nBecause in 1960 she got the news of Pan mouzanhua's death. This hit her a lot, and for quite a while, she never returned to her country again. \\nModerator: So, some people say that women like Pan mou Yuliang are often lucky and lucky enough for her artistic path and her emotional journey. Today, the most important man in his life, Pan mou Zanhua has gone. At this time we are afraid to turn a topic, that is, in her most classic, most delightful two sculptures, in addition to a Daqian statue, there is also one of Wang Shouyi statue. Some people say that Wang Shouyi is Pan mou Yuliang's lover in Paris, is it? \\nGuest: I can't say that, but one thing is certain that Wang Shouyi was an important figure during Pan mou Yuliang's life in France. You can also say so, a man who broke into her second half of her life. \\nWang Shouyi went to France in 1919 to study hard work, and later opened a Chinese restaurant. He was married and had a child before leaving the country. When Pan mou Yuliang came to France again in 1937, they met. At that time, Pan mou Yuliang's life was extremely distressed. One time Wang Shouyi went to visit her, found her hungry face difficult to see, so she quietly stuck $20 in Pan mou Yuliang's door seam. At that time, $20 was a large amount. For this reason Pan mou Yuliang was very moved, since the relationship between the two people became closer. \\nBut for so many years, Pan mou Yuliang has been thinking about Pan mou Zanhua. Because of this, she (Pan mou Yuliang), has a sense of guilt in her heart, she began to shape his avatar, and after Wang Shouyi was shaped like it, she was not sent to the museum, she did not send it to the outside for exhibition, but in her bedroom. \\nLater, Pan mou Yuliang was the object of Wang Shouyi as a kind of emotional interrogation. Any internal distress and he said that his life difficulties also asked him to help. Wang Shouyi also remained with her side until her death in 1977. \\nModerator: After Pan mou Yuliang's death in 1977, Wang Shouyi paid for a cemetery in Montparnasse in Paris. Wang Shouyi wrote the gravestone written by Wang Shouyi himself: Tomb of Artist Pan mou Yuliang. In fact, Pan mou Yuliang's body did not come back, but then her paintings actually came back. What happened? \\nGuest: Before Pan mou Yuliang's death, handed over to the beside Wang Shouyi, can be said to be the death of the death, she has three requirements. First, put her on a set of cheongsam after her death, and I think that she would have to be a Chinese woman, this is one. Second, she left two relics, one with a necklace hanging a chicken box. The box opened inside a photo, a small photo when Pan mouzanhua and Pan mou Yuliang were married. Have been hanging around their neck, how many years ah. The other is a pocket watch. Pan mouzanhua sent her to the river when she went to France for the second time. These two things, she handed over to Wang Shouyi, she has to transfer these two things again to the offspring of Pan moujia. The third thing, her desire, be sure to bring her work back to her homeland. \\nModerator: Very touching death words, entrusted to Wang Shouyi. Did Wang Shouyi finally do it? \\nGuest: In 1978, when Wang Shouyi returned home, of course, he wanted to look for Pan moujia's descendants after returning home. As a result, Pan mou Mou was gone at this time. On the eve of the National Day, he handed over Pan mou Yuliang's two relics to Pan mou's daughter-in-law. \\nModerator: At this time, Wang Shouyi should say that only two pieces have been completed. So is Pan mou Yuliang's work back? \\nGuest: After Wang Shouyi returned to China in 1978, he could not go, but he still returned to France in order to bring Pan mou Yuliang's work back home. But after he went back, he found that there seemed to be a lump behind his ears, went to the hospital to check it out, and it was a malignant tumor, so he died very quickly in the hospital for more than ten days. \\nHe went too suddenly, and his family was mainly in mainland China, and his aftermath was helped by his friends. Since he had not had time to buy the cemetery, Wang Shouyi was later buried in Pan mou Yuliang's tomb, and the tombstone was added to the tombstone with the king's name and the month of death. Wang Shouyi really has been accompanied by Pan mou Yuliang in the last years, and in the years after. \\nModerator: It is very emotional, but Wang Shouyi left. How should Pan mou Yuliang's work go home? \\nGuest: It is still up to the state and the government, and after the government of China and France, by 1984, Pan mou Yuliang's works began to return successively, a total of more than 4,000 copies, all returned to the motherland, and most are hidden in the current Anhui Museum. \\nModerator: Later, Pan mou Yuliang's work was recognized by the world. At the 2005 Christie Hong Kong autumn auction, a self-portrait of Pan mou Yuliang in 1949 was traded at a very high price. Some say Pan mou Yuliang is China's female Van Gogh. What do you think about this review. \\nGuest: One of the important reasons why Van Gogh's portraits are so high is that Van Gogh's life is very twisty and surprising, as does Pan mou Yuliang. \\nModerator: Now in the history of fine art, studying Pan mou Yuliang, I think there are no more than two things. One point, Pan mou Yuliang's art does have her characteristics, because she is a representative of the process of combining the art of this kind called Xixue Dongjian. But I think the more important point is that Pan mou Yuliang's unyielding spirit of struggle, this is more worthy of people's study. (Wenhui Reading Weekly)"}

In 1963, Pan shilin Shiyi was born in this kitchen. \\nAt an early age, the family was poor, because of poor nutrition, Pan shilin Shiyi's mother was paralyzed, and two sisters sent people (later picked up again). But unlike the village people, although the village's poorest, parents still bite teeth for Pan shilin Shiyi to read. When the little sister sent a person, the only condition that parents put to the adopter was to grow up to let her read. \\nWhen Mao Zedong died in 1976, a man from the same landlord came and told Pan shilin Shilin, who was working on his own land, and told him, 'This time your doll and my doll have hope.' \\nAfter Mao Zedong's death, Pan shilin Shiyi's father kept writing letters, hoping to get a rehabilitation. There was also an episode before the rehabilitation. A slogan 'Down Mao Zedong' appeared on the wall of the village. The Public Security Bureau had been unable to resolve the case. The method of voting by villagers was 'electing' the perpetrator. The father of Pan shilin Shiyi won the second number of votes because he would write. Knowing that he may be arrested, he handed over to Pan shilin Shiyi two articles. First, as a man in the family, to live with his mother and sister. Second, the slogan was not written by him, to help him cry out. \\nLater the case broke down, Pan shilin Shiyi's father escaped his suspicion, and the right-wing identity was repudiated. Pan shilin Shiyi's father once said optimism that the county has drawn more than 100 right-wing, many people sent to the sandwich ditch, only 6 people survived, and he returned to his home and felt 'very good'. \\nIn 1977, after his father was settled, Pan shilin Shiyi also became a city account, studying excellent in school. In 1987, Pan shilin Shiyi 'under the sea'. He recalled that the decision to 'go to the sea' was opposed by his mother, because at that time Pan shilin Shiyi's salary was higher than his father (monthly salary of 101 yuan in 1987), 'What are you doing in the sea?' But the father's mouth opposes, the heart wants to go out exercise. \\nAt that time, China built the Special Administrative Region, and the social atmosphere also encouraged young people not to settle in with the status quo. Pan shilin Shiyi soon succeeded, but did not think he had a business DNA. \\nPan shilin Shiyi attributed his success to 'good at, with people of different personalities, people of different backgrounds, people of different ages, can be good friends', and this is influenced by the mother, 'a kind of humility in the body of the mother, can be friends with people around.' He told a story where his mother was in danger, stayed in a hospital for 10 days, and finally his mother and three patients in the ward became good friends. \\nPan shilin Shiyi said that whether a person can unite, can unite the people around it, can make friends, this is a particularly important ability. \\nThe following is the interview recorded:\\nReporter: Why do you like this flower so much, is this what you asked for? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: This season of flowers is particularly true, you see this sun, then it is gone, there are shadows and flowers in this place, soon it is gone, you see this is almost impossible. \\nReporter: Flowering period is short, flowers are the kind of particularly valuable, and glamorous one, like a beautiful woman. \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Oh, yes, my mother was very beautiful, my mother was particularly beautiful, and the result was to go to the countryside. My dad was particularly rough at a glance. \\nReporter: So you have to get rough up and adapt to life? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Right. \\nReporter: Why is that mother paralyzed? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Malnutrition, there is no treatment for all kinds of reasons, and eventually do not know what causes paralysis. After that disease, paralyzed, came to Xiehe Hospital to see it, said that the disease occurred 30 years ago, what the cause is, I don't know. \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Because our family is not good, so a large number of houses in our family have been distributed to villagers, to our home (that is my grandmother, my aunt, my uncle), left little house, and when my mom and dad return to the countryside, we live in a kitchen, that kitchen Is a temporary house, living in the kitchen. \\nReporter: There is a stove over there? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: There is a stove, there is a pot or something. \\nReporter: How is the bed placed? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Kang, we do not have beds, are all a kang. \\nReporter: It's the kind of fire? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Fire, I was born in this house, was born in this kitchen, I was born in November. My mother said that when I was born a few days, I suddenly found a leaf flowing over this kang, and actually the house was built from someone else's house, and this place was leaky. \\nReporter: And November is particularly cold? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Yes, the northwest is very cold. \\nReporter: How old are you at home? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Boss. \\nReporter: The boss will have to be the eldest son of the family, such as the father, then you are the first child in your family, so you sure you have eaten any bitterness? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Yes, anything bitter has eaten. However, the parents also put all their hopes on me, because they feel that there is no hope anymore. \\nReporter: So do you think, in the impression of your childhood, what is the hope of Dad like, that is, when Dad had he ever been young and wise? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Yes, young and intelligent. At first, in my blisty first impression, I thought he was very optimistic, very strong, and everything he did was different from the people in the village, was all kinds of things. \\nReporter: For example? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: For example, I don't let me speak dirty words, and brush my teeth when I'm small. And one of the biggest differences is the conflict with the villagers, he does not believe in ghosts, so this yard, digging for a moment, and digging for a while, this is particularly taboo for farmers, must not easily move this soil ah. \\nReporter: Because of what? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: If you want to dig earth, if you move earth, this will destroy Feng Shui, my dad does not pay attention to this. Neighbors in the village continue to come to my mother to tell my mother, saying that your family will have a lot of evil, can not be so disrespectful of the ghosts. \\nReporter: But your dad doesn't care? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: He doesn't care. \\nReporter: What about your mother? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Mom is a little more weak personality. Unlike Dad is very firm, that is, I am an atheist, I have to be different from those uneducated people in the village. (Dad), like this, often with my aunts, my uncle, ah, big man, ah, village neighbours, that is, conflicts of all kinds. \\nReporter: Your father's name contains a poetry, which was rare in the local area at the time. Pan shilin Shilin, a very literal name? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: His name is poetry, is Kirin's 'Lin', this Kirin's 'Lin' written very complicated, is to write a whole lot to write it out, peasants remember when they think it is a 'forest' on the line. My mother's name is Chao Qin. 'Chao' is this one trillion under a Japanese word. The piano is the 'piano' of playing the piano. As a result, when the peasant registrar, he said, 'Chao' was too difficult to write. He wrote a hello, 'piano', uh, he wrote the 'celery' of celery, that is, these words that you are many strokes, he doesn't need to pronounce the same. \\nReporter: But do you think your father still does not agree with one, and can use this kind of great knowledge of dragon ah, Kirin ah ah, young people, at once changed to 'Lin', mother (name), was changed to 'cress' of celery, then they admit it? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: They do not admit. I think they have been in the village for more than a decade. In my opinion, in the years ahead, they didn't agree, they thought they would go out sooner or later. From the first day, they didn't think about staying in the countryside for a lifetime, especially let us go to the countryside for a lifetime, but to the last is 1975, 1976, when I was a little older, but I was also able to see it, I think they were desperate, is...\\nReporter: Are you finding their changes, what did you find from? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: At the beginning, he was walking the way, sitting posture, eating, and having to be different from the peasants. At the end, it may be a little older, and then about 10 years, I think they are slowly getting closer to the peasants, they also look like, sitting. It's like, lying down, the way to eat is also slowly like. But the things in the mind, he does not change, and every day he's heart. They are all the hearts of China, the heart of the world, uh, are doing it. \\nReporter: Look at some newspapers, or radio at that time? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Yes, when broadcasting, our village was nine (Phoenix net editor note: Nine National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in 1969), it was after China opened the Nine National Congress, and I remember that it was...\\nReporter: There was no semiconductor at that time? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: There is no semiconductor, there are no big horns in the village. I remember opening nine victories closing when the villagers knocked out, saying it was the end of the nine victories. I said what it meant, I asked my dad, he said that one would be open. I said that the closing was open. What did we not know when we opened? How did we not know when we opened? At that time when you don't know, closed to know, so after the nine big, only have the horn, just have the horn, we do not understand, that is, Putonghua does not understand. \\nReporter: Then what? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: listen, slowly familiar with a few years, to be able to understand. \\nReporter: You just said that some of the behaviors of parents are becoming more and more like peasants, but in fact, their flames of hope are not extinct, they transform this idea into you? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Yes, that is the last word. When I was a teenager, ah, talk to me every day, saying that our hopes are all placed on you. Constantly strengthen this, saying it is the hope of the whole family. I remember one year when I worked on my own land with my dad. As a result, a person suddenly ran down from the mountain and ran very quickly. After coming, I quietly said to my father that Chairman Mao was dead. And then my dad said, Oh, how did you know that? Said it was said in the horn opposite, he heard in the mountain and ran down. I just look at my dad's special expression. I heard the villager saying to my dad, 'Yo, this time your doll and my doll have hope!' Because his house is also the landlord. This is my most impressed. \\nOh, I said such a big thing happened, I had to look at their expressions, look at their reactions, and talk about something. These two words, uh, are the most impressed by my impression. \\nPan shilin Shiyi: As a child often starved, my parents bite my teeth, let me go to read. \\nReporter: When you mentioned the landlord, I remembered that when we were young, we heard that the landlord, you were the talent of the landlord. \\nPan shilin Shiyi: That was before liberation. \\nReporter: Yes, what kind of day did you live as a child, your landlord's talent? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: I've never crossed my shoes after I went to junior high school. \\nReporter: So you're not the boss of your home, you don't wear your own shoes. Who do you wear? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: I wear my aunt's shoes, my grandma's shoes, the shoes they wear. I remember when I wear shoes, I always had a big piece behind it. And my aunt's shoes, mainly wearing a few of their shoes, a few of them finished, and I put them on. \\nReporter: Have you been hungry? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: mainly starving, so at that time, Chairman Mao had a quote, whether to give Wang Jie an inscription or to whom, was an inscription for the heroes, called 'One is not afraid of bitterness, two are not afraid of death.' (Note by the editor of Phoenix Network: 'One is not afraid of suffering, two are not afraid of death', from Wang Jie's diary of Wang Jie, a soldier of the PLA Wang Jie. is one of the 80 slogan in the history of the CPC. In April 1969, Mao Zedong said in a speech at the First Plenary Session of the Ninth Central Committee: 'I agree with such a slogan called 'One is not afraid of suffering, two are not afraid of death. '' This statement was published in the form of 'Chairman Mao's teaching' after the 'Ninth Congress'. ('One is not afraid of suffering, two are not afraid of death' then popularized in the form of slogans throughout the country, becoming a popular discourse for political mobilization, inspiring morale.), \\nReporter: Zhang Side, is it? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Zhang Side or who, anyway, is a hero character, the hero character inscription called 'one is not afraid of bitter, two not afraid of death', at that time, the child is not afraid of death, bitter words, where can you suffer? Not afraid, I'm afraid of hungry, this hungry is really hard to suffer. \\nWhen we were young (in the village), 27 families, in this age of famine, more than half of the people went out to flee for food during these months of famine. I remember one time, my dad numbered under the locust tree, 27 families in the village, and 17 families who went out to escape for food. Others, the food they eat is relief food. The relief food is not food, it is a very thick sweet potato chip, that is, dried sweet potato chips in the ground. Therefore, Henan people saved our lives. For a few months, it was time to eat this sweet potato chips constantly, eat this sweet potato chips, and each sweet potato chips. All kinds of ways to eat, grind into noodles to eat, then cook it, stir into cakes to eat, how to eat is difficult to eat. \\nReporter: Yes? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: And you are like drying in the ground, sometimes there are mildew spots above, eat very not delicious. \\nReporter: In the toughest times, in your impression, that tough years, what did the mother do, how did she think of ways to make you better, a little longer a little stronger? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Basically in my impression, my mother was paralyzed, so this...\\nReporter: No ability to take care of you? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Because this just returned to the countryside, this kind of cold ah, this disease, ah, did not eat, quickly paralyzed, so after this paralysis basically did not help the home. \\nReporter: So at this time, you are the main labor in your home? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Right, the main labor in the home. In fact, in this situation at home, a natural choice is not to let me go to study ah, my brother and sister can't go to study anymore. I remember the most words I heard in this village, 'Your home is one of the poorest in our village, and what do you do? You see two of you, pointing at my father and my mother, reading so many books, not still suffer this sin?' So, I think that one of the greatest decisions my dad and my mom made was to bite our teeth and let us go to study, and finally we didn't eat, and I remember when I gave my little sister to someone else, the only condition mentioned was that growing up to let her go to study. In fact, given to this family, parents are illiterate, they don't know a word, and finally they still follow the promise given to our family, let my sister go to study. \\nReporter: Isn't it that your little sister came back to her back? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: sent two sisters, this is a little sister. \\nReporter: Your family sent two sisters? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Yes, two sisters sent away, this little sister sent out earlier, another sister is more than 3 years old sent out, 4 years old back back. \\nReporter: Is your sister in someone else's home? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: He came back after he went to high school. \\nReporter: So that back was the sister, how did it come back? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: She first took a train, that is, she took a train. \\nReporter: You first tell me that sister, that sister was sent out first. \\nPan shilin Shiyi: First sent my sister out, because my mother did not have milk, the child is about to starve, so I want to send out ah. In a few villages, whoever has a milk sheep, gave it out, so we found a farmer house with milk sheep and sent it. \\nReporter: What does the mother feel after sending her sister out? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: When this sister sent out, because it was relatively small, only a few months, two months and three months, it was sent out, so the parents...\\nReporter: How old were you at that time? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Should I be 10 years old, 7, 8 years old? 10 years old like that. Because this sister is small, sent out, parents must be uncomfortable. But in order to survive, it is also an inevitable choice. \\nI remember the family, when I came to hold my sister away, brought us a couple of biscuits over. When sending my sister, we had a total of two quilts. As a result, my mother put our family a quilt, wrapped this sister, and left after the package. I also told my mother that you gave it all the quilt, and we didn't cover it tonight, and there was a quilt left in our house. My mother said, Oops, the children have sent people, so let this quilt accompany your sister. After delivery, we eat cookies. My other sister and I eat cookies there, and gave it to my mother, and my mother said they didn't eat. \\nReporter: Later, why did you send another sister out? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: The second sister is particularly miserable, because more than 3 years old sent out ah. My mother did not cry either. Every morning, I had a nightmare and told me that I had a nightmare and told me about this nightmare, and the people of our family are particularly bad. Communication is not very convenient, write a letter for a long time to be able to arrive. What I'm most impressed is that my mother said, 'I dreamed of your sister last night. He was feeding the pig, the pigs were big. Your sister was all pig food on a cotton jacket, it was dirty. That's how to tell me that the last thought, I can't stand it, this psychology, ah, it's hard to bear, it's probably less than a year. The time, just took my sister back. \\nThen, my dad was watched by the production brigade's backbone militia and prevented him from coming out on the site of an agronomy contest. And he said to me, When the morning is lit, you will go to another village and go back to your sister, and I said, OK. Our village was originally called Pan shilin Jizhai. Another village, uh, is a village that has turned over several mountains, called North Ocean (Yin). In fact, the road is still relatively far away, about 20 Hua Li Road, 20 Hua Li Road is 10 km, but walking in the mountains is very far away. Am I not bright away? My dad said, in case there were wolves outside, that is, we often had wolves in that mountain, he said it was dawn, let's go, I said, OK, I would go dawn. \\nWhen I went to this house, I saw my sister, and my sister would also speak, but when speaking, with the Shaanxi cavity, it changed for a year. The first thing I felt was that it was not my sister who spoke. The family feared that she was hungry on the road, and brought her some cakes. This cake was made by the Shaanxi people. It was called a stone, and the stone was put some stone in the pot, and after the stone was hot, bake the cake out. Especially hard, especially dry, so that, this is not easy to be bad, and eat her. Then the family gave us two bowls of rice, and then I came back with my sister. \\nReporter: Do you remember how your mother met her sister after your sister came back? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: carry over, back words are particularly tired, I say you also walk, are mountain roads, we go along the farmer's terraces, section down, so it is faster, I remember to go to a village called Nanyang, from our village is still separated from our village, I found that in front of the road is me Dad, I said you didn't let that Giganming look. He said I ran out quietly. too. \\nReporter: On the one hand, he was worried about whether you would encounter wolves on your way, on the one hand, he wanted to see your sister earlier, what kind of when he met her sister? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: I have no impression of seeing my sister, I remember the only one, is my sole fell, is the only shoe clamp of cloth shoes, the sole fell. \\nReporter: Isn't that equal to a barefoot mountain? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Yes, of course, we are all earthy over there, and it doesn't matter. One has a sole, one has no soles. My dad asked the soles. I said the soles were lost. My dad read and said, I have to buy you a pair of liberation cards shoes and make a promise. Oops, broke me happy, maybe a few months later, really bought me a pair of liberation cards shoes. \\nPan shilin Shiyi: At that time, my dad was thin as firewood, especially thin. My dad then often said, 'If I spent more than a year in the countryside, and a year later, my body would certainly not support.' And now he said that to me again. I was told again two days ago, saying that these days are fast drying up, boiled for more than a decade. You want a man in a difficult environment for more than a decade, but my dad is a particularly optimistic person, he told me, you see I also divided into the right, this county has drawn more than 100 right, many people have been sent to (sandwich ditch), a total of 6 people, the others are all dead. So he said, 'Look, I'm pretty good, drawn a right, come back to my home, feel very good, but in the end it really can't boil. \\nReporter: After the pundling, are there better days at home? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: One thing happened before the rebellion, that is, our village ah, a reactionary slogan appeared on the wall, do not know who, wrote a 'knocking down Mao Zedong'. \\nReporter: Yo, that's a big thing! \\nPan shilin Shiyi: After writing, the Public Security Bureau came over, people in the village could not go to work, they stopped together to solve the case. The Public Security Bureau is solving the case every day. All villagers are not allowed out. This is the biggest thing in our village. As a result, it was closed for a few days. This case could not be broken. The public security bureau used a stupid method, saying that the case could not be broken, and whoever voted, who was a lot of votes, my dad wrote a word, and the peasant certainly thought he wrote it, so he voted for him, and after voting, he got the second vote. First name. \\nMy dad stole and ran. At that time I was asleep, about seven and eight years old. He suddenly woke me up, and then told my mother that now the Public Security Bureau wants to solve the case. He is the second place. He may have been caught up immediately. If he said he got caught up, he told me two things, the first thing, you are A man in the house, be sure to bring your mother and sister to live; The second thing, this slogan was not written by me, must go and cry for me, I said good, to shout for you. \\nReporter: What about the end result? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: The final result was broken again. It was written by a teacher at our school. Finally he was caught up, I remember as if I had been sentenced to three years. \\nReporter: So you see, your father is not easy on this kind of historical node? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Escaped the disaster. \\nReporter: So he wants to keep nagging today to see his son prominently, so prominent? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Yes. After Mao Zedong died, my dad wrote to all people saying that I was a grievance, and then sent out the letter continuously. I think he does not do anything else every day, writing letters there, and I don't know how many letters are sent out. \\nReporter: For our fathers, um, reputation, ah, this reputation is more important, so may this shouting for grievances really become one of their most important things? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Right. A colleague from my dad, who was working at the county reform committee at that time, called him a phone call, and he said you were flat. Oops, my dad did not know how happy it was, and then the uncle who called said that the punitive document allowed an uncle named Hu to bring over. This was the phone call to our production brigade. That is, on the phone at the team site, the brigade conveyed to my dad, that is, my dad flattened, and written documents let Uncle Hu bring over. Uncle Hu is probably separated by four villages with us. When my dad got this news, I told me, 'You hurry on a bicycle and go to get this document of the recuperation. I was riding a bike all the way up and down the hill, the result was particularly fast when a big downhill, I suddenly intuitively, I felt that the roadside person, was uncle Hu, but this downhill was particularly fast, I rode, to their home, I introduced who I am, I heard of Uncle Hu My dad took the documents, and I came to get it. Then this aunt said, Uncle Hu came back and quickly sent this document to your dad, and did not dare to delay sending it. Then I thought, the person he met on the road must be Uncle Hu. Then she said, 'Let's eat a meal. I said, OK, I took two bowls of noodles at their home, and came back on a bicycle, and when we came back, our home was flat. \\nReporter: That man is Uncle Hu, should? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: It should be Uncle Hu. \\nReporter: Later, you went to Tianshui to school? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Later, he went to clear water. There is a Tianshui city in Tianshui area, there is a Tianshui County, and there is a Qingshui County. We are Tianshui County. We called here in Qingshui County. \\nReporter: You left home to school, go to school outside? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Our family, uh, has just settled for a few months, a month or two, a month or two. \\nReporter: How far is the place where you went to school from your later home? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: 400 km road. \\nReporter: 400 km road? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: 400 km. \\nReporter: How to get? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Lanzhou, to Lanzhou. \\nReporter: Is it going by train? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: There is a train to go. \\nReporter: When you went to school, what did your mom and dad bring you something, that is, something in your luggage? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: First of all, when you talk about the rebellion, the biggest thing to say. \\nProduction team rations, delivered to the food shop, the food shop will give us food invoices. How many pounds of wheat, corn, sorghum, beans and oil have to be handed over, but when it comes to our home, we don't have any oil, how to do it, then I pulled a car, pulled a shelf, put all the food rations in our house, I was alone, I took it, I took it and handed over. At that time, I told him that our family was all coarse grains, no fine grain. In addition, we did not have oil when we split our house. He looked at the documents of rehabilitation and looked at these things and said, 'We know that there is no fine grain in your village, so let's give you, give it to you, how many points give you how much. Giving me more than 100 yuan yuan, gave a lot of food tickets, a thick grain ticket. This is the future of our family, half a year of food, and I took this out. \\nReporter: With food stamps, your family should have improved a lot at once? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: became a city account, but long looks like this farmer. When I go to school, others say this child is not a city person, I say yes, just two months into a city account. \\nReporter: Why is there a difference at a glance, black? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Face tanning ah, then hairstyles, clothes, ah, say nothing like people in town. \\nReporter: If you want to go to school, will you be discriminated against by other classmates? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Maybe they think how our class came to such a classmate, they all felt strange at first, and there was no discrimination. However, in the end, it is not discriminatory. Because my studies are good, I always have the first place in my class, so if I learn well, there is a little advantage. \\nReporter: You learn well, surely it is also forced by your father. In such a harsh environment, I want you to study. He just wants you to rely on a book to come to the forefront, right? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Yes, when I want to go to school, quilt, bedding, these things, ah, have to have a bag of cloth, my dad said to buy a bag of cloth, and bought me one. I remember it was a dark green special thick cloth bag, and then the luggage was ready, and he looked at my hat, especially that hat, and he said there was no way to wear this hat in town, and said to give me my hat to you. In that era, everyone had to wear a hat, so, he changed that hat. I thought it was very good, just put it on. \\nReporter: Actually, one thing I don't understand is that after you learned that year, you originally went to the state unit, very good, job security, but later you decided to go to the sea. I think it's important to come out of a family like you, do a very common unit work, and this is a particularly big affiliation for parents, right? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Right. \\nReporter: You wanted to go to the sea at that time. Have you discussed with your parents? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Negotiated. My mom is very opposed, and she says your salary is higher than your father's salary. Your dad has done so many years of work, and your wages are not high, what are you doing under the sea? \\nReporter: How much was the salary at that time? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: My last salary strip under the sea is 101 yuan, in 1987 101 yuan, is a relatively high salary. I remember washing fee 1.5 pieces, bike maintenance fee 1.5 blocks, field allowance 20 blocks, which is the highest, sitting in the office every day, there are 20 yuan in the field allowance for a month, somehow. \\nMy dad, the inside of his mouth was opposed. In fact, I knew his heart still felt, went out to exercise, and not be afraid of suffering. So it went down to the sea. The atmosphere at that time under the sea, and the current atmosphere, I think there is a little different. Now it is to solve the employment problem and start a business success, it is this atmosphere. At that time, the mental state and atmosphere of the whole person were actually particularly influenced by the China Youth Daily and the China Youth magazine. That is, to do some things that promote social progress. Then, China is establishing the Special Zones, Shenzhen and Hainan Special Regions, and our young people could not be safe. In the status quo, to be able to make a difference, it is"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": " such an atmosphere. \\nReporter: Yes, that is called passion. \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Yes, all people have the same state, and all people in this age are the same state. Not only my parents, but also our villages, our hometown, my parents' words and deeds, give me a lot of strength. \\nIn the early 90's, it was already very successful, then, we made a lot of money, at that time in the city, in this familiar environment was a little numb. But every time I met my parents and talked about the hardships we suffered when we were young, went to the village to see, suddenly sober. A lot of things, see a little more clearly. So I feel that my background of experience is still very helpful to my growth, step by step development. \\nReporter: So you often talk about DNA, do you have business DNA over your house, do you think? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: I don't think there's no DNA in business. \\nReporter: In the end, that is to say, what kind of atmosphere influence, let you later in the mall like a fish? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: You just mentioned, that is, talent. In fact, I think in this society, do anything, these things don't matter. Many people think that this is very important, including you just asked, saying you have a business DNA on your body. I don't think these things matter. \\nReporter: Not important? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: The most important thing is this era, who can't do without anyone, you have to work with others, if it is a, feel that you are a genius, talented people, often despise the people around, this is his biggest enemy, he does anything bad. Doing business, working in politics, or engaging in academia, it is not good to do it. So in this era, you have to rely closely on the people around you, and if you leave the people around you to help, you will have nothing to do. You alone, and the people around you are broken, you can't even live for yourself. \\nI think I'm more good at being with people of different personalities, people from different backgrounds, people of different ages, can be good friends. I think this kind of humility with my mom-being able to be friends with all around us-has a great impact. I remember my mother was ill once, living in a military hospital, the army's hospital called that 133, stayed for 10 days, and then it was a little better, I could come out of this ward, a total of 3 people in this ward, all three people were best friends with my mother. You think, at the time of illness, to this line of life and death, she can make such a good friend, so I think that is, can a person unite, can unite the people around, can make friends, this is a particularly important ability. \\nReporter: Make friends, even turn enemies into friends. \\nPan shilin Shiyi: turn enemies into friends. When will you turn your enemies into friends? When will you make friends? You must be a humble person, who respects others. If you're a proud person, friends become enemies, huh? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: From the first money I earned, I said, I must take my mother over, go to her to treat her disease, and then did not go back, just lived in Beijing for 20 years. \\nReporter: I've always taken her to see a doctor. \\nPan shilin Shiyi: has been with her, not promising. \\nReporter: So, what do you think is the happiest thing about Mom and your life on this day, does she usually nagger something with you like dad? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: She is actually a very optimistic person, that is, interested in a lot of things. I think she is still an intellectuals. She is constantly reading, all kinds of books are read, constantly listening to music, reading books. But she is not the same as my dad. She reads more books than my dad, but she doesn't write how to write, my dad often writes, has journals every day, and writes articles, and all kinds of articles are writing. In my mom that was, constantly reading, enjoying music, she didn't write. When the original letter was written, 80% and 90% of the letters were written by my dad. So I think my mom has a spiritual world of her own, and she's a very delicate kind of person. \\nReporter: We may have to live with our parents to have such an experience. That is the parents of the generation, they are too frugal. The biggest contradiction between me and my mother is that I often criticize my mother, I say you see, what kind of thing, good time to eat, finally broke it, throw it, and always eat is rotten, every time I look at her like this, I will fire. \\nPan shilin Shiyi: At first I also had this contradiction with them. Finally, I think, as long as they live well. I remember leaving my original refrigerator to them when we moved, and I looked at it a month later, there was nothing in the refrigerator, I remember a bottle of vinegar, a pack of chili noodles, this big refrigerator. \\nPan shilin Shiyi: I said you don't buy a la carte, buy meat, my dad and my mother said we don't love to eat. I said you can buy some water, buy juice, he said, drink tea, drink tea, drink it, there is nothing, and finally I think, as long as they live happy In order to drink this juice, mess things don't necessarily be good, right? \\nReporter: Ah, this kind of encounter with you, especially easygoing personality, is it who follows them? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: With my dad, with Dad. My mother, despite all these years of paralysis, is very careful, my mother is a big beauty, and you have to look at her pictures, very beautiful. But I'm more like my dad. \\nReporter: People say that his son should be like his mother? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: But I look more like my dad. \\nReporter: More like dad, that character is also genetic dad? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Personality, I think it's my dad and my mother's integration. \\nReporter: You just said, Mom will be stronger, isn't it? Is she more demanding about things? \\nPan shilin Shiyi: Finally paralyzed, that is, there is no way, no way. \\n[Editor: Geng Xia Santan 'Consensus Network']\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"}

He said: Pan Pan shizhao is the old lawyer who is most persecuted by the Cultural Revolution. I am the character he dares to tell the truth. When I met Mr. Pan, I was immediately infected by his kindness. \\nI am a very radical person, and at the age of 17, I participated in the 'Fight Against Hunger,' 'Civil War,' 'Anti-Persecution' student movement. The following summer, I was admitted to the Chinese Department of Normal University and participated in the 'Democratic Youth Alliance', which was a communist clandestine organization at that time. After the liberation of Beijing, I was still in the first year of college, and I was transferred to work in the central working area of the Communist Party Committee. Until the second half of 1949, China University of Political Science and Law (not the current Chinese University of Political Science and Law), was established. I secretly went to apply and was admitted. In the second half of 1950, Renmin University of China was established, and the former China University of Political Science and Law was merged to Renmin University. After merging with the University of Political Science and Law, the NPC established the Faculty of Law, and I went to the first year of law, and I finished four years this time. When I graduated in 1954, I was catching up with the restoration of the law department at Peking University, so I came to Peking University to teach. At that time, Chen Shouyi, the head of the department was familiar to everyone. I was classified as 'right' in 1958 and started three years of labor. It may really be the saying that people often say: I am 28 years old I was classified as the right, 32 years old I became 'counter-revolutionary' in Qinghe Farm, 34, I went from Qinghe Farm to Heilongjiang Farm, and then the Cultural Revolution began, and I was working in remote rural areas for more than a decade. When I returned to Peking University at the end of 1978, many of my students have been teaching for years. Chen Shouyi, my old leader, who was also a teacher, found me, and eventually I chose the Law Association. I have worked at the Law Association for 12 years, and I have a deep feelings about the lawyer's cause. Lawyers strive for the legitimate rights and interests of clients, based on facts, based on the law, dare to speak and speak the truth, this spirit is always worthy of admiration. I have reservations about the professional ethics of individual lawyers at present. It is they who have affected the overall image of lawyers, which have significantly reduced the trust of the public in lawyers. This is not conducive to the development of the lawyer's career. Therefore, the lawyers are in urgent need of education and upbringing. I am very concerned about the development of the lawyer career, and I am particularly pleased to see the achievements of Beijing law profession in recent years. As the most persecuted by the Cultural Revolution by many people, Pershone does not reveal a slightest sense of grievance, he has a very positive attitude to life, and has not given up his faith in truth even in the most difficult times."}

It is proposed that a body be set up to deal with these opinions: I have the following three points on dealing with internal conflicts among the people and carrying out a hundred contention. First, Chairman Mao has once again proposed a liberal approach at the Supreme State Council, and everyone is very excited. But there are such doubts: I say anything today, after a period, a year or two years, is what I said is to count? Not only do I have this idea alone, but some of the people I have been in contact with. Some friends talk about the wind and don't know if we're going to get inside? Others doubt that the whole party is now the whole party, will it be our turn over a period of time? Second, I hope that one hundred people argue is not a 'gust of wind.' Emphasis on organizational discipline in the past, not good speech; now one hundred people struggle, what can be said. This atmosphere should continue forever, do not go through a period of military recruitment. If it is released and closed, it will not have a good effect and will not help academically. Third, it has recently been seen from the newspaper that the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of China and the relevant departments have held many meetings, and people made many opinions at the meeting. What are these opinions below, everyone is very concerned. Whether it is possible to set up an organizational body to study and analyse these comments. Any immediate implementation that can be adopted, rectifies it immediately in accordance with the facts. This way, it must have a great role in regulating the internal relations of the people. More recent seminars have been held in intellectual circles, and they seem not to have been held among the workers. As far as I understand, workers also have a lot of opinions, and leaders should also open seminars with workers. I feel that some leaders do not know much about folk suffering. There will certainly be a certain improvement after the liberation of people's lives, but what exactly has been the improvement? Is there a general improvement? Leadership has not considered enough in this regard. I am commuting from work every day and I can hear the opinions of some masses in the car. I feel that leaders need to take a way to listen to the opinions of the masses. Beaten as right-wing elements; subjected to downgraded salary reductions.

I moved from the Catholic Church in France to the Department of Chinese Language at Fudan University, and Mr. Pensz was transferred from St. John's University as Professor of Foreign Language and Librarian of Fudan University. His wife Chen Yongjuan also followed Fudan Foreign Language Department as a lecturer. \\nBefore the Cultural Revolution, I was sentenced by the Shanghai Intermediate Court for 12 years on charges of 'Hu Feng anti-revolutionaries', in prison for 11 years. In 1966, I was imprisoned to reply, and was assigned by the Defense Section to supervise labor at the printing plant, which was told that Mr. Pan was beaten into the right in 1957 and was punished by a downgraded salary reduction. On the eve of the Cultural Revolution, a false accusation was made against Mr. Pan and two famous professors, Wang Zaoshi and Sun Dayu, who were beaten as the right-wing history department in 1957, to organize the so-called 'Chinese Socialist Party'. After the incident of the 'Chinese Socialist Party', Mr. Sun Jiuli Committee imposed strict control and sweeped the land at the Chenghuang Temple in the south city. Wang Zaoshi and Pensz were caught in jail. Mr. Wang died in jail. Mr. Pan was held for seven years, and after release, was also assigned to the printing factory 'labor transformation', so we became a hard friend. At that time, Mrs. Pan was still teaching in the Foreign Language Department. The Shanghai Public Prosecution and Law Office gave his family a paper of judgment, and ruled Mr. Pan 'wearing a counter-revolutionary hat and handed over to the public supervision and reform.' She did not understand her, holding the verdict and asked people everywhere. \\nDuring the period under control of the printing plant, I did some heavy work, such as sweeping the ground, cleaning public toilets, gutters, carrying heavy loads, pulling labor cars, etc., in short, the most dirty and even the most dangerous. Mr. Pan is older than me, and he does something relatively light. Such as large sheets of paper folded neatly, then cut out. When he was criticized by the dictatorship group, he could not bow his head, nod his head, say, 'I am a foreign slave, buy it,' and so on, or write censorship and thought report below. \\nHe originally lived in a very large garden house in West West, and the morning of the 'Cultural Revolution' was captured, he had time to eat breakfast in the future, he was rushed into a critic meeting, and announced the arrest on the spot. At that time, four police officers suddenly rushed out of the kitchen and immediately handcuffed him. It turns out that these people were ambushed there the night before. \\nThe house is big, Mr. Pan's family does not know that there are still strangers at home. After the sentence, the house was confiscated, and the police committee in the security area moved in, and Mrs. Pan and her children were forced into a house in a common building to live together. Because they are so-called 'counter-revolutionary families', they are despised by the surrounding tenants and subjected to stigmatization and discrimination. After Mr. Pan was released from prison, their clothes were washed out from their homes, because some of them were foreign goods, often taken away by others, and they did not dare to say anything. However, Mr. Pan did have money, bringing lunch at the printing factory, often grilled suckling pig, fried steak, chatyaki, kefir, and jam and cheese in bread. This kind of Western food was very new to the workers at the time, I don't know what that was. He blows a whistle when he's okay, he's a brute sex interesting person. \\nIn 1979, Mr. Pan was rehabilitated. At that time, I had not yet settled, but lifted the supervision and returned to the Chinese Department of Information Office. Mr. Pan asked me if I still went to the printing house, and he said that he went to the foreign language department every day, and he brought the meal to the printing factory at noon, and then took a break. The workers there are now good for him, and at the time of the birth of his grandson, he gave each one piece of chocolate. He said that it was our grandmother's house. We can't forget, oh, I want to go. \\nLater in the 'Cultural Revolution', Nixon visited China, Mrs. Pan's sister was working at the United Nations, when the two families began to resume communications. My sister wrote to her sister, saying that you never had Mr. Tipan on the letter, was he over, or were you divorced? The sister wanted to return home to visit them, and there was nothing else in the family but a table and bed. Mr. Pan contended for the face of the Chinese people, so he went to Long Wenpei, director of the Foreign Language Reform Commission at the time. He said that relatives came from the United States and had no chairs at home. Although there were beds to sit, according to the habits of Westerners, it was very unpolite to allow guests to sit in bed, and it was bad for the country to influence them. I hope that the leaders would lend them temporarily. A hotel room to entertain guests. The director of the dragon said: 'You are a counter-revolution, the counter-revolution is this treatment. You talk to your relatives about your political identity and do not have to hide it. Reception at your home!' Of course, my sister came, there was no law to live in Mr. Pan's home, but had to go to the hotel. \\n'Cultural Revolution' was over, Mr. Pan's son in Baoshan first went to the United States to study, then Mrs. Pan also followed, and settled there, Mr. Pan also went after his retirement. But two years later he came back again. After the new library was completed, I invited Mr. Pan, as the current curator, to attend the opening ceremony and had lunch together. Later Mr. Pan translated the 'Three Words', wrote to me, with a paper letterhead, with a brush small letter very solemnly wrote: Jia Zhifang big brother both Jian, translated the 'three words', wanted to check the relevant version, my brother greatly assist Yunyun. \\nMr. Pan's 'Three Words' was later published in Singapore. \\nMr. Pan, a patriotic intellectualist, left behind in liberation and wanted to do something for the country. He donated books, praised by the Government and joined the Democratic League. However, in 1957 he was beaten to the right, and the Cultural Revolution was framed and sat in prison for seven years. It was so bumpy and half a life. Later, there was no disease, older, and it passed, at the age of 84. \\nI learned about the sad news of his death in the newspaper, always wanted to write an article to commemorate him, but he was too old, a little hard to heart, but his face was spit in my mind. We get along in a special period of years, Mr. Pan is a friend worth remembering. (Essays 2000 Issue 4)"}

They have moral talents, literary and warriors, red an era, their fathers and folks as an example to educate future generations, school teachers as oral teaching materials to inspire students to learn, play the strong melody of civilization culture! \\nOn March 22, I walked back to the hometown of talents-Gao Tang Town, visit the first talent 'spawn Pan wanlin' of his people's affairs, Duan Superman's memory and other stories filled with joy, deep admiration! \\nThere is a 5,000 acre dam in Gaoang Town, with a village on both sides, home to a generation of hard-working farmhouse and daughters. The reporter went along Tian Da to Fengbao village, in the middle of a wooden house in the middle of a wooden house in the middle of a wooden house, exactly, 74-year-old Pannianqu (Pan wanlin's nephew), at home, the elderly took the bench to let us sit, understand our meaning, then he talked with us with the pleasure of Pan Pan Wonderful story of Wan Lin. \\nnot forget to expose\\nPan wanlin was born in August 1901, reading books at a young age, superman memory, unforgettable. Originally enrolled in Gao Brewery 'Marigold Cottage' and read books such as 'Qionglin', he only read it again, the text and content of the whole book can not only be back but can be reversed as stream, the comments in the book are also clearly remembered. Mr. Lo Yat Fu, who taught him at that time, was admired with his amazing memory, and gave his daughter Luo Cui-Chu Hsu to his wife. \\nFive years of the Republic \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), Pan wanlin admitted to Tianzhu High School. All subjects, can only listen to the teacher talk once and again can be used, the language lesson 'the battle of Chibi', before and after 'out of the table', the teacher read it again, he can back, explain again, he even the words of the teacher do not leak out. He earnestly listened to, heard and heard, and never studied at class, but the teacher asked questions, could answer the flow, and every exam, he spent only one-third of the required time, and the grades were always the first place in the class. Teachers and classmates shouted: 'Generated Pan wanlin!' \\nPan wanlin likes the exposition group of books, after school time to 'Fengshan College' (1877, the former reading room of Tianzhu people in the Qing Dynasty Guangxu three years), to read books, he never went home on weekends, opened books in the college, is one day, often forgot to eat and drink water, send him money every week to send him rice without touching him, always put in his store, write a leave and go back. \\nPan wanlin in the college read books without buying books. Once, the admin looked at his love book so much and advised him, 'Wan Lin, such a good book? You buy a book and see it.' \\n'I don't need to buy books, I read books, I can back.' \\n'Is it?' The administrator does not believe that from the bookshelf with Pan wanlin read a book open read: 'Low trees can hide rain, suspension comes with wind.' On the page? \\nPan wanlin does not hesitate to think: 'This sentence is in the third penultimate line of a page. This page starts with: 'South from Qinggui old, Xijiang few white apples new... '' Pan wanlin Lang back, more than 10 pages back in one breath, and back back from behind. \\nThe administrator marveled Wanhou: 'Ouch yo yo yo yo-, Pan wanlin, Pan wanlin, said you do not forget the name of the name, the name is not known!

In 1931, the Tianzhu County Government conducted a armor training course in Guanyin Dong, and then County Governor Li Linshu invited Pan wanlin to teach, the wizards, the county governor on the spot to test its depth of poetry. The two people turned 11, the county governor defeated, did not want to do it. Pan wanlin again gave the county governor a first:\\n'I used to be more than twenty, not bad. Whip the eyebrow water, East flow injection big. Miss Gu laughing, Peng Lang Xinying. Years have been, running across leeches. A few empty decisions, Ca Mau surprised is missing. No heavenly, the Yellow River cracked.' \\nSee Pan wanlin without thinking about the export, mayor surprised: 'Which university did you graduate?' \\n'Ruiren Poolside Graduation!'

He gave poetry to the cloud: 'What is the life of a boy? He wants to waving a sword, when the lady fox.' In 1926, Wang Tianpei was promoted to the tenth army chief of the National Revolutionary Army and appointed Pan wanlin as the First Secretary of the Military Department. From the army several years, Pan wanlin returned home once, he rode a big red horse, behind a few followers, very majestic, and also very platoon, his father met dislike, because he did not want his son to talk about the pitch, Pan wanlin put the horses at the edge of pear trees in front of the door, his father cut the horses off the horses and ran, and read the words nagging Pan wanlin listened to his father's teachings, accepted humbly, and went door-to-door to visit the elderly, and reported to the family grandpa. ; when he went back, went door-to-door to the house clan and quit. \\nAfter the disarmament of Pan wanlin, he sought employment in various counties. When he returned home, Xianya sent a man to lift him with a car, walk to 3 kilometers away from home, he sent people back, walk home himself, not let his father find him sitting in the car and get angry. When seeking a job in Jinping County, thinking that after the death of his family mother, his father had no companion and lived alone, he introduced Liu Bao-zhu from Maoping Town, Jinping County, the unit worker, to his father as his wife. The father thinks this is an inverse thing: 'Since the beginning of heaven and earth, it has only been heard that the father marries his wife for his son. It's going to leave a joke, no!' \\nPan Wan Linshun and his father enlightened the idea: 'I am the person on the scene. People often come home with me, I come home, no mother comes to shout. How is it a decent thing, no mother's children are like root grass, how do you say I face the official field? You marry my wife, I have a mother, the best of both worlds, the beauty of all times, why not do it?' \\nFor the sake of his son, his father agreed, Pan wanlin personally funded the marriage for his father. Since then, the story of 'son marries a wife for the old man' has spread in the mountains and villages. \\nMagnificent Psalm\\nPan wanlin, a generation of Wenhou, thousands of miles from the army, turned to the north and south; all over, see the wind and dust, throughout his life he wrote a lot of magnificent psalms.

The people of the grass mustard, hated to Kunwu. Blood sprinkle lake can be blue, soul is not alone. Yue tombs a generous, cast iron Ho Koo.' \\nPan wanlin's 'Yizhu Xuan Poetry' has two articles that make people read endless aftertaste:\\n《Haining View Tide》\\nWanma pentium out of the sea East, waves shook empty. And who thunderbolt three thousand times, then a bow to the head. \\n'Dynaus Stone Column Song'\\nLion back to Jinfeng, thirsty drinking Shuangjiang water.

Words seem to have a little appreciation, which is, of course, a feeling in retrospect now. At that time, as a child, I didn't think much, much less what the landlord meant. It was not until a teenage age that I knew that the landlord was an unforgivable sinner, and the public enemy of the people, if it was a great landlord, then evil would be heinous. We are educated to clear the boundaries, so we are afraid to avoid our own history. How dare to inquire about our family? \\n\\tI only remember hearing my uncle and his friends once said that many people in the Northeast are rare, landlords cannot be too bad for permanent workers. Not to mention that many permanent workers are relatives and relatives. How do I mean it is bad for people? I felt that what he said was not in line with the school teacher, but I didn't dare to ask. Plus since the young father was not around, the only five uncles who had been in contact became the right, lost contact, and even more ignorant of their own home. \\n\\tIt was not until this century that I wanted to know the family, but the old people almost all died. So the history of Panjia is always vague. Here is the story to find through the only bit of clues. \\nAccording to the recollection of the only surviving elders five uncle, today's Panjia in Daan (formerly Heilongjiang Daqu), in Northeast Jilin Province (formerly Heilongjiang Daqu), moved from Shandong Longkou (formerly Dengzhou Fuhuang County), through land through now Hebei and Jilin provinces over 150 years ago. Longkou in Shandong peninsula Bohai Bay side, is located in the northwest of Jiaodong Peninsula, affiliated with Hyperlink 'http://baike.baidu.com/view/7309.htm'\\\\ t '_blank' Yantai city, the ancestral city of Linhai ten lai, near Nanshan. So my roots began in Longkou. \\nDengzhou Huangxian ancestral house\\n\\tIn the Qing Dynasty's 'Dengzhou Fuzhi' states: 'Dengzhou Fu east to the sea 400 miles south to Jimo County, Laizhou Fu Ye County, 150 miles west to Laizhou Fuye County boundary, north to sea one hundred miles to Beihuangcheng Island, about 600 miles from the sea to Fengtian Lushun mouth, about 600 miles to Gaizhou Lushun mouth about a thousand miles, from the sea to Fengtian Lvshun mouth. One thousand Fuji to Beijing 860 miles to provincial cities 920 miles, 640 miles from east to west and west, 641 miles from north and south, Penglai County east to Fushan County boundary 90 miles (to county to 1440 miles), west to Huangxian boundary 40 miles (to county governance 60 miles), south to Qixia County boundary 70 miles...'\\nHuangxian is a port to the Bohai Bay, with a population of 1.2 million. In the past, famous for producing fans, is the longkou fan that we all know. According to locals, it is not because of this estate mung beans, but the weather and sunshine here are suitable for fans. In the late Cultural Revolution, Huangxian County, 50 kilometers from Penglai, Shandong, was renamed Longkou, but locals still call Huangxian County or Huangcheng. It's still called the bus station there. \\nThe most famous local is Nanshan Temple, the first stop of my survey trip is here. The Nanshan Temple in Longkou is no smaller than the Nanshan Temple in Hainan Island, but also serves more gods, not just Shakamoni. The temple has Nanshan Zenji Temple, perfume, strange is Nanshan Temple, which in addition to worship Laozi, also dedicated Guan Yunchang. Hainan Island Nanshan Temple later added the Guanseyin Bodhisatta that stands on the sea, the Nanshan Temple would certainly not be comparable to here. The Buddha here is definitely no less than the Big Buddha in Lantau Island, Hong Kong. Nanshan is 10 km from Longkou County, and there are five or six golf courses around the temple and the corresponding real estate industry. There are many Japanese and South Korean people who come to live here on weekends and play golf. \\nNow the most famous here is the 'Nanshan Group Company', which was ranked 163rd among the top 500 Chinese enterprises in 2011, was chaired by Song Zuowen. This person has served as the third team leader, village chief, village secretary, party secretary, general manager and chairman of Nanshan Group. Its industry was founded in 1978, and since 1994 Hu Jintao has visited several times. \\nNanshan Group is engaged in aluminum, worsted, tourism, education, finance, aviation, science and technology industry, elderly health, wine and real estate. The company has more than 20 residential areas and nearly 60 companies. It also set up branches in Australia, the United States, Italy, Hong Kong and other countries and regions. \\nNanshan Group seems to be a family business because Song's two sons are in key positions. However, it is interesting to think about family businesses and party organizations. I also served as party committee secretary, and in June 2011, Nanshan Village Party Committee was awarded the title of advanced grassroots party organization in Shandong Province by Shandong Provincial Committee. This can be said to be a change in my ancestral home for centuries. I am very interested in what origins Mr. Song Zuowen is: Landlord, Rich Farmer, Middle Farmer, Lower Middle Farmer or Poor Farmer? It's a pity that I couldn't find what was vital to me in that year. \\nWang Hongbin's HyperLINK 'http://baike.baidu.com/view/2874.htm\\\\\\ t '_blank' Hyperlink, Luohe City, Henan Province' http://baike.baidu.com/view/437591.htm \\\\\\ t '_blank' South Street Village in South Corner of Linying County, Yuzuomin's Jinghai County, Daqiu Zhuang, Tianjin, and Song Zuowen in Dongjiang Town, Shandong, Yantai City, Shandong, are three typical of the post-reform and opening up rural areas in mainland China. Although these three typical ideologies differ, especially Nanjie Village, ostensibly represent a rather left-leaning revolutionary ideology, their essence is the same, that is, the family group that unites government enterprises. \\nAccording to some local people, this secretary is a local top, and many locals will get jobs of about 1,000 yuan a month, such as Nanshan Temple cleaning workers. But if you are found not due diligence, such as the pipe section of the road is not cleaned, leaving dead leaves, it will be fined to this month's salary, so the Nanshan is very clean. \\nOn the Internet, the remarks cursing their home are a lot that reminds me of the bully landlords I heard when hours of class education. Is he better than them? Unfortunately, these stories and the landlord's evil acts are not proven. \\nAccording to the clues provided by my uncle five, I asked Panjia Village in Nanshan generation. Finally found a woman who was cleaning on the way to the Jade Buddha. She told me there was a place under the mountain called Zhao's Mashan. Panjiacun is right next to it. So I hired a car and asked all the way. Local people say that there are three villages connected together: Zhao Jia Village, Panjia Village and Qijia Village. So finally found Panjiacun five kilometers east of Nanshan Temple. \\nSouth of the village is Nanshan, about two kilometers away, is now an orchard apart; ten kilometers north is the seaside, that is, Longkou County town. Village West is a creek that flows to a reservoir outside the village, it is estimated that it was repaired in the 50s and is unknown. You can imagine that in ancient times this is a mountain and clear water show place, but the rolling gently hilly landscapes make traffic confined, and poverty is inevitable. And this poverty is the root cause of my ancestors emigrated to the Northeast. \\nNowadays, young adults are rarely seen in rural areas, mostly elderly people, women and children. Women are married from outside the village. I don't know the local changes. I can only talk to a few elderly people and understand the situation. It boils down there are a few points:\\nThis is the only Panjiacun in this area. Originally full name Pan, a small number of foreign surnames have moved into recent years. \\nLater, a village of Lower Panjia was separated. They had to come back to take soil when they were buried.\\nZhao's family was later, only a few decades, but the population is large. At present, this area is fully divided administratively as Zhao Jia Village. \\nPanjia's genealogy burned during the Cultural Revolution\\nThe oldest age is 82 years old, but I don't know anything that broke into Kanto 100 years ago, but only know that there was going to Northeast in the 1950s. \\nIt should be said that the old people in the rural areas of Shandong are actually not too old. The old man I met, even though it was full of face, asked down, but there were fewer than 70 years old, apparently related to the hard life in the countryside. This is also an important reason why it is difficult to get to inquire about past things. I estimate that this is related to the Holodomor created by Mao Zedong in the late 1950s, that is, the population also has an age issue. \\nThe houses here are all newly built, built with stones, a row of three or four houses per row, with the old wind preserved at the gate. I turned around in the whole village, estimated to have twenty or thirty families. The foundation of the house is very solid. Compared to the European countryside, though messy, it's all rustic beauty. \\nChinese culture actually originated in Shandong and Henan. It may be premature to exploit, resources are slowly consumed; it may be climate change, the environment is gradually difficult; it may be that ideas are outdated, and the economy is still inland in nature and cannot be developed despite the sea. Perhaps the conservatism of Chinese culture is deeply entrenched in this peninsula, and science and technology has no room for accommodation; perhaps the fall of the dynasty leads to corruption and corruption, and the people are not enchanted. In short, people here are increasingly hardship, coupled with cyclical disaster, so at the end of the Qing Dynasty, described in today's words, is Shandong's immigration activities that have continued for more than a century. \\t\\nNortheastern area is the hometown of Manchu people. After the entry of the Qing soldiers into the border, the Manqing government is not open to the guanchi. In particular, Kangxi seven years \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), implemented a national ban policy, resulting in a large number of areas in the Northeast deserted, known as the North Great Desolation.

Millions of peasants emigrated to the north-east. It can be said that Japan's aggression stopped the immigration activity, which lasted more than a century. \\t\\nThere is a 52-episode TV series called 'Chuangdong' tells the story of the 20th century, from the end of the Qing to 9.18 before the outbreak of the incident, a Shandong people forced to leave their homes for life. According to the clues I learned, my ancestors left Shandong in the 19th century and should have been much earlier than the TV story. \\nOur Panjia is from the land, through Hebei, and has experienced about several generations. It is no longer possible to start this specific activity. Only know that they first went to Nongan near Changchun, and are said to be settled in a deserted village. Nongan is 70 km northwest of Changchun, Nongan County is the site of Golden Dragon Palace. The so-called straight yellow dragon refers to here. \\nThen about two generations, then via Songyuan, finally went to the Nen River, is now Daan, used to be called the Daan (Yin Lai). \\nMy ancestors, like the vast majority of the Kannehan people, went to the northeast for development in the field of land. This is the so-called crossing of Kanto. So call it 'break', in the Northeastern language there is a sense of desperation into strange places. According to the old generation, pioneering the way called 'running horse occupied deserted'. Specifically, reclamation rights are purchased from people who own large tracts of land but are unmanned. According to the agreement, according to the pre-delivered silver, it was agreed to take a few days to ride a plot of land. The condition is to come back at the agreed time, that is, running out is a closed circle. If you can not come back, the deposit will be lost in vain, if it comes back, it will have the right to land land land. After the land is reclaimed, the contracted and the original flag men are divided in half. \\nThis is a very interesting game: if too greedy, riding too far, not coming back at the agreed time, you lose your subscription. If too cautious, come back too early, too little lapse, not cost-effective. The Northeast land theory (sound Shang), the equivalent of 10 mu or 15 acres, the Nen River Basin is 15 acres. It is said that you can circle several thousand. This requires that the brothers of a family cannot separate their families, not only cannot be divided, the next generation can not be divided, and people have a lot of power to cultivate and operate. We call the big ranking, that is, the grandfather's generation does not separate family, the uncle's generation is down in a sequence, so there may be more than thirty uncles and dozen of the names, and there will also be thirty or forty brothers. \\nIt was very hard to go out to reclaim their land for cooked land. They were heard that they were eating on the ground and slept in the open air until winter they moved to the shack. This is made of brick blocks made of clay and wheat straw, also known as dry baskets. Compared with Kannai, there is little pressure on the population, there is room for development, hope, or much better. There are more land reclaimed, you need to hire people to seed, many permanent workers are in fact Shandong's family relatives, well done, the population of the home, can also stand up, slowly developed. To my great-grandfather's generation, the family of Pan's family began to be good, and the children breed more. In the western area of the big river, the village was formed, called Pan Jia-Wai Zi, so far on the map. \\nIn the northeast of that year, in addition to the honest people to open arable land, there are also people who hope to get rich quickly, go to beating homes and homes. The Northeast is called beard, that is, bandits. The source of the mustache is because bandits often do not scratch their faces and leave a beard. Although beard robbery, but also to follow the rules of some black tracks, usually 'rabbits do not eat the nest grass', that is, do not rob their own country; robbery money does not rob, not easy to kill. If the famous Bong leader Zhang Zuolin, was born beard in the early years. \\nIn order to protect themselves, the local large family would have to circle the entire village with a wall, leaving only one main gate for the people to enter, so called the fence. This kind of negative confrontation beard surrounded by the tiger does not go down the hill. Our Panjia is such a siege, so it is called Pan Ka Wai Zi. This wall actually has a mile to see, and so far there is still a remnant earth wall. If further development, the wall will become bigger, you will need to build the side door, not only easy access, if necessary, from the side door out of the mustache. Such a circumference is called a tiger down the hill. From the development of the natural village, so the wall began to have the size of the town, the wall is high. We Panjia have not reached this scale yet. \\n\\tAccording to the memories of my five uncle, he hours, that is, in the 30s of the last century, after entering the autumn, there were people from Shandong's home to ask for his grandfather, bringing some souvenirs from Shandong. Of course, they came to hope that the already developed cousins in the Northeast will receive them. And the grandfather of five uncle, my great-grandfather, would naturally not let them go back empty to the New Year. \\n\\tThe grandfather of five uncle, my great-grandfather is Pan Changyou, and several of his brothers are still pending. Pan Chang has a total of four children: Wan Bao, Wan Jin, Wan Qing and IWC. Because several brothers in my grandfather's generation are not separated from home, according to the big ranking, my grandfather Pan Wanqing was old eight, later called the eight grandfather. \\n\\tChinese culture mainly originated in Shandong and Henan, a century ago, even in poor rural areas, preserved many traditional cultural practices. In accordance with the ancient customs of Shandong, almost every family has rules on the names of future generations. When a family comes up or changes, new name rules are laid down for future generations to continue into a prominent family. Unfortunately, in China's property inheritance system bets 1, it is unlikely that the family can last for a long time. We can find that Panjia has such ten words of name rule (double name):\\n\\tWen Ke Hong Changwan, Samurai Yingyong Dry\\n\\tIf you're 20 years old as a generation, from the literary to my father Wu, it's about a hundred years. And China and Russia's 'Love Pact' was signed in 1860, and Panjia emigrants to Northeast China should be after this analysis, the literary generation may still live in Shandong. These ten words are not like the two sentences of a poem, how did I still not test out, just want to have some lectures. \\n\\tBorn in 1881, my grandfather Pan Wanqing first married Shaw, had two men and two women. My father was the old two, and their first generation ranks. After the death of my grandmother, my grandfather married Wang, and had four men and two women. The only surviving thing now is my five uncle, Vivu, born in 1927. \\n\\tPan Wanbao, a brother of Pan Wanqing, and his children are still in the great hug, and their two veins are still relatives. Another brother Pan Wanjin is the old four in the big ranking. He has four sons: Zhao Wu, Jingwu (my Panjia's nine grandfather), Xianwu, Wen Wu (later renamed Hong Tao). I heard that other descendants of Wanjin are more in Lindian, Heilongjiang. There is also a brother Wenwu. He has a son in Jilin city, a woman in Baicheng city, and more with my grandfather's grandchildren. \\n\\tAt that time, Pan Jia-Wai's son had a lot of population, and my father had dozens of people, my cousin, the greatest of his age as my father. In addition to Grandpa eating small stoves, so these people have to be together. When the people heard the bell, they came to eat, and the size of the family was visible. It is said that some homes are better, they secretly open small stoves, do not eat the large cafeteria. Of course Grandpa occasionally came to eat guys, then no one dare to come. \\n\\tMy grandfather had some commercial head, and he went to the county town to open the noodles to buy nearby wheat noodles to sell flour. Later, he opened the pot shop. This is Northeastern, which is Shochu. The raw materials used are locally-produced sorghum and yellow rice. Because the business was done well, my grandfather left Panjiawizi and lived to a big spot. It can be said that he was on the road of a market economy to really develop. Now the storefront, the factory has long been dismantled, in front of it became a school called Daan city experimental school, is estimated to be the local key school. Behind became a commodity room. Although you can't see any traces here, you can still feel the scale of the year. \\n\\tMy father was born in Daqu in 1909, 17 years old, that is, when he went to Tianjin Nankai middle school in 1926, when his uncle brother Pan Jingwu ranked Lao Jiu, and Zhou Enlai were the first students enrolled in Nankai University in 1919.

My nine-grandfather was the famous basketball team captain of that year. And my father was a good player in tennis, especially because he was a left-handed and a great advantage. \\nNine Uncle Pan Jingwu has been an active member of the school's social activities. In Nankai, he was president of the Student Union and opposed the 21 agreement between Yuan Shikai's government and Japan, he was the organizer of student marches and was very good at speaking in front of the public. It can be said that he was famous than Zhou Enlai at that time. Pan Jingwu participated in the establishment of party organizations in the Northeast of the KMT in 1931 and served as a Party Affairs Steering Committee of Heilongjiang Province. When Pan Jingwu was the director of Heilongjiang Construction Department, the vast majority of important civil servants were Nankai alumni. Later, he was promoted to Heilongjiang Province President, and key officials under the provincial government were Nankai students. \\n\\tTo 49 years later, the first party member congress of Minkor Heilongjiang Province was held at Heilongjiang Hotel in Harbin from October 9 to 10, 1958, with Pan Jingwu serving as Secretary-General. On September 2, 1963, Harbin, Harbin, the third party congress of Heilongjiang Province, also has the name of Pan Jingwu. After the start of the Cultural Revolution, the Nine Grandfather disappeared. Until the 1990s, I asked the CPC United Front Department, and responded to 'No such person.' So that today we have not made contact with his descendants, my cousins and sisters and their descendants. \\n\\tThe decline of Panjia began with Japan's invasion of China. Eight people were killed in our family, mainly by Japan's forced cholera vaccination. A little sister, only 3 years old, died after a needle, threw it in the lime pit, came alive, called Dad. Saved by Grandpa. But the Japanese knew they came to the needle again, and finally killed. I heard that my big Burpan Zombu couple died of Japanese bacterial weapons. \\n\\tThe anti-Japanese coalition forces in the northeast have lived in Panjiawei. As if Pan Wanqing understood the political direction after his resistance to Japan, he said to Uncle Four at once, pointing to the land outside, 'These are not yours in the future.' Perhaps because of this insight, my grandfather offered to donate half of his family assets to the anti-Japanese coalition forces in the Northeast. At that time there was a receipt, written on a small piece of paper and many stamps and stamps. This receipt was kept in the hands of my old aunt, my father's little sister, Pan Shuya. To the Cultural Revolution, the old aunt is a rural man, no culture, only see the article on the list are property, afraid to say it is the landlord's change account, quietly burned. \\nMy father Pan Jiwu left Tianjin by steamboat in 1923 from Nenjiang to go to high school. My father is my grandfather's favorite son, and it is said that the brush is written well, and his father's word is hanging in his house. More than 100 years have passed, Pan Jia who is working in agriculture has finally gone out to school, except Pan Jingwu, that is he. In that year, farmers went out to large cities to go to secondary school, probably much bigger than they were going abroad today. Uncle Five said that that day grandfather riding a yellow horse, standing on the Nen River, looking at the boat far away, for a long time refused to leave. \\nHis father graduated from Nankai High School in 1929. In that year, when he was 20 years old, he was studying in Belgium on public fees and travelling by train to Belgium via Siberia. He received his degree in Mining Engineer from the University of Bikin in 1936 and returned to his country in the same year. The father said: 'Never thought that he graduated not to return home, studying abroad is to serve the country.' \\nHis father knew Han Suyin, a writer who was later known in mainland China. Her father was Zhou Wei, a pioneer in Belgium studying HyperLINK 'http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E5%88%A9%E6%97%B6\\\\\\ o 'Belgium' and engineer of Sichuan Railway Bureau.

Such an exotic marriage was very rare in that year. His father met many students from Nankai high school and were classmates in Belgium. They all returned to the country after learning. In the late days of the CPC War, many people went to Taiwan, and later went to work abroad and maintained contacts with each other. Until today, there is still a grandwife of a father classmate. We call her mother Liu, 98 years old. \\nI heard that their father studied French only in Belgium, a year later enrolled in the University of Leuven, outside the Belgian capital of Brussels, to study mining, one of the best universities in Belgium. I didn't understand how they had mastered French in such a short period of time. According to my father told my mother, there were very strict requirements for studying in Europe that year, as long as one of the grade examinations had not been taken, all the courses that were taken in that year had to be re-examined, and the pressure was very high. \\nAfter returning home, his father worked as an engineer in Kailuan coal mine. The predecessor of Kailuan coal mine is the Kaiping coal mine established by Li Hongzhang Ocean Affairs Movement. Grandpa later went to Kailuan, where his father worked for some time, and that was the only year when their father and son had gathered together alone. The father also attempted to return home to visit his loved ones. When he took the train to Changchun, he found that the area had been fully controlled by the Japanese, and if he returned to the Nenjiang countryside, he would probably not be out again. His father came back to Kannai immediately. However, he left his homeland since the age of 17 and never embarked on his homeland. After the war of resistance began, his father resigned to Sichuan, and his father and son never met again. \\nWhen he was an engineer in Chongqing Sancaisheng coal mine during the war of resistance, met my mother, married and lived in Huangguoya. Born to my brother in 1945. My brother and I were born when they settled home after the victory of the resistance. His father went to the Northeast Xi'an Coal Mine as chief engineer. Because of the Communist Party War, siege there for a year, unable to work, had to come back Note 2. . Hope to go to Shanghai in 1948, because the PLA encircled Beiping and arrived in Taiwan in early 1949, and since then my brother and my brother were separated from my parents. \\nFather teaches mathematics at a university in Taiwan. Work at UNESCO in the early 1960s, in Africa belongs to the Congo, today the University of Zaire. The father died abruptly in 1969 at the time of nursing care in Belgium, as a direct result of low blood pressure, and the sanatorium never coped with a crippling patient. At that time, China was undergoing a cultural revolution, and my contacts with my parents were completely disrupted and I didn't know that I had lost my father. When my father left me, I was two years old and had no impression of him. I haven't seen my father. It's my lifetime regret. It was because of him, the three of our brothers and the sister born in Taiwan, left China for decades and finally emigrated to North America. This is similar to the migration of ancestors from Shandong to the Northeast. \\n\\tMy grandfather Pan Wanqing died of illness in 1943, and this could be a good thing for him. After the victory of the resistance, the PLA, assisted by the Soviet Union and the United States, quickly moved to the northeast. In order to raise salaries, the 'Land Reform' campaign was launched. As a landlord's family, Pan's family is of course the brunt. Because the relationship between landowners and tenants (permanent workers), in the Northeast is usually better, there is little 'class feud', so the Communist Party has used land change for land reform. This is to exchange land reform from Tunli to the nearby Tun Li, to avoid disturbances in the country, the name of which is called the big net. The Land Reform Task Force first used forced information to solicit money, which is to ask for currency, gold and silver and jewelry that can be cash immediately. \\n\\tMy grandma, Wang, was caught and tortured all day long, forced her to surrender her hidden money, but after the destruction of Japanese aggression, grandfather died again, and the family business has been withered. How much money has been? But the team did not let her go, and she decided to commit suicide. Tell the children before their death, 'Go to tenants without food, and they will not disadvantage you.' She also managed to hide some corn and soy to the child. Then when people don't pay attention, plug a hairpin into the ears, hit the wall and die. \\n\\tGrandpa's youngest bro"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "ther Pan Wanguo was beaten all day, he kneeling there a day was criticized, and the original grandfather bodyguard Han Lao Gada suddenly rushed over, beating him with a wooden stick to death on the spot. Han Lao Gada is said to explain that he can't stand to see him guilty anymore, sooner or later die, it is better to leave early. My seven grandfather Pan Chengwu was also killed. He should be my uncle, the child of Pan Wanbo. Pan Shirong, the son of the seven grandfather, was more able to say, was also killed. The people who listened to him said, 'He can say so, it is still after release.' \\n\\tAt that time, if the landlords who had been battered were not squeezed, they were divided into fields, and I was often sentenced to death immediately on the spot. Because in the fighting conference, the task force has provoked the masses beast and killed landlords, people have no way back, and only revolutionized with the Communist Party. But there was not enough bullets to kill the landlords. The usual way was to kill a stick, and it was heard that there were buried alive. This is an hour when I listened to the words of my adult. I can't remember who said it. But then adults were afraid that their children listened to the backwardness, and the real news about their hometown was avoiding the children from talking about. \\nMy four uncle, Pan Xuwu, born in 1922, came out of the northeast after the victory of the resistance, 1948 was the last (26), trainees in the mainland, 1949 with the army uprising, joined the PLA, and continued to study at the Southwest Military and Political University West Branch. In 1951, it was incorporated into the 60 military teaching team, in the name of the volunteer army into the North Korean war, becoming the 'cutest person'. I saw him when he returned home after the war and felt proud to have such an uncle. \\nDespite his death, he was still not trusted, demobilized in 1955 and returned to his hometown as a secondary school teacher. When the Cultural Revolution was born as a landlord, as an anti-revolutionary soldier, was battered. On September 7, 1968 unknowingly died in the Northeast wetlands, commonly known as bubbles. On that day, the country celebrated the 'red mountains and rivers throughout the country'. That is, all provinces and cities set up revolutionary committees with three combinations of parties, politics and military forces. Uncle four became another stepping stone of the revolution. \\nFive Uncle Pan Vivu, born in 1927. He was a graduate of Beijing Railway Institute. He lost contact with us after being beaten as the right, until Mao Zedong died, and I did not find him from the United States by writing to the United Front War Department. The great reason he became the right is the landlord's origin. After removing the hat to wear sin remains in the original unit, Tianjin Railway Design Institute work. At the time of retirement, he was an important engineering staff of the hospital. He hasn't dare to contact us for fear of right-wing identity. Even so, I was outward during the Cultural Revolution, saying that there was a right-wing uncle, which became a crime for me. But it is this revelation that confirms our speculation about the five uncles for many years. \\nUncle Five also helped many loved ones in his country during his most difficult times. It can be said that if it wasn't him, I would not be able to find my loved ones at this time. He was the only old man in my previous generation who was alive, and now his memory had decreased significantly, and could not ask him about Pan's past. \\nIn the 1960s, when Mao Zedong engaged in opposing Soviet revisionism, we heard reports explaining why Eastern Europe had also changed: because they did not engage in bloodshed Revision 3. From this point of view, mistreatment of landowners and slaughter of landowners is not the following left fault, but rather an established strategy to force the people to revolt. How could the people involved in the killing of landlords not be resolutely revolutionized in the KMT and the Communist Party at that time? But after the CCP's national victory, why not let the landlord be left behind? Is the revolution of inertia? Or the rule to control the countryside? Moazedong came up with the slogan 'Don't forget class struggle' after the failure of his great leap forward, at a time when the prestige of the party's senior leadership weakened. This has brought about a catastrophe for the remaining landowners, rich farmers and their families over the next decade. \\n\\tI've been asking myself why Panjia can be big landlords and where does their money come from? Even in the light of the productive capacity of rural China today, it is impossible to grow rich unless a large agricultural machine is used. The use of large machinery in the early 20th century was impossible. So are they really exploitative wealth? If tenants and permanent workers are poor, how much wealth can they get? Rent is nothing more than collecting food, how much can I sell? How to ship to Kannai to sell? How can they develop sustainably for many years? This is not a moral issue, but a mathematical or economic problem that can not be enriched by the exploitation of the poor. Of course, the rich people in China in history and because of their origins in the eunuch, may take pride. But Panjia has no one ever been an official, they are farmers. \\n\\tOnly when I was in the center of Da'an today and saw the scale of Panjia's original pot and noodle factory, I suddenly realized that Panjia's rich step-by-step step-by-step approach to market operation. In the words of yesterday's official words, it is to go to the path of capitalism; in folk words, it is only business to get rich; in the words of Deng Xiaoping, some people became rich first. It is reminiscent of my visit to the royal compound and Qiaojia compound in Shanxi, and the ancient village of Xishuinan Village, Nanchang, Jiangxi, have similar historical footsteps. This is where China began to move towards capitalism at the end of the 19th century, and the business society is taking shape. By the 1930s, the national economy had developed considerably. Unfortunately, the process was interrupted by Japanese aggression. The private sector in Shanxi, Jiangxi and Northeast have gone downhill in this way. I think other parts of China may have suffered the same setback. \\n\\tLooking back in history, while Japan's aggression caused the loss of lives of the Chinese people, including our Panjia, all of which suffered greatly, this was not the characteristic of the Japanese war of aggression that year. All wars have died, and even people died of starvation caused by Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward than the Japanese killed directly and indirectly in China. The biggest feature of the Japanese war against China was the disruption of China's development path to modern society, which was Japan's greatest harm to the Chinese nation. \\n\\tI also have to say that the 'business' that the Japanese invasion did not complete was completed in Mao Zedong's socialist revolution. Shanxi everyone's final defeat was land reform, and our northeast Panjia completely collapsed in the land reform. The development of township commercial activities in the 1940s had to be closely linked to agriculture. The confiscation of land is tantamount to breaking the roots of national industries; public-private partnerships put private enterprises on death row, and China's development has stagnated for at least half a century. This is the revelation I got from thinking about the history of Panjia. \\n\\tNow history has turned over another page. Panjia also gradually gained respite. In 2008 under the leadership of five uncle, I first went to my home, to visit the loved ones that never seen, even heard, but also worship the ancestors with you. \\n\\tIn fact, we all believe that Panjia is a Heilongjiang people, because in history, the big Chinese belong to Heilongjiang. After the victory of the resistance war, the national government does not know why it divided the northeast into nine provinces. Because his family is on the banks of the Nenjiang River, it was transferred to Nenjiang From the map, Daan is the big one in the lower left corner of Heilongjiang. There is Da'an Port, located at the junction of Jilin Province and Heilongjiang Province. It is the only river port in Jilin province. As an amphibious pier for more than 80 years, commonly known as the old Kanzi Pier.

But international flights have long been closed. \\nIn Songyuan, Jilin, I saw numerous cousins and sisters for the first time. They all have peasant faces and manners, and they look all too young, I would almost call them uncle and aunt, but ask, it turned out to be my cousin and cousin. The vicissitudes of years are portrayed on their faces. I am most lamented by the unanimous pride of saying: We are descendants of landowners, and our children have all gone to college. From the silhouette of a niece, I see the look of my elder daughter. They have the temperament of the city. \\nCome to the old home, the former Panjiabei Zi is scarce remnants, just a mile of the square wall has become a near-desolated township government compound. It is estimated that this was a good place in the past, of course, the township government's preferred choice. Now the government became rich first and moved away. Unfortunately, the government Yu Weishang was, the door was locked and could not go in. Of course, it is not absolutely impossible to go around the back, but I think about it, or don't take it, after all, this is no longer Pan's home. \\nAfter visiting nearby residents, learned that the original old house did not have one left, change greatly. The original residents have long left, and my four uncle family has long moved to Daan City (Daqu). They are probably the last family of Pan's ancestral land, now just one of my cousins and her husband are half unemployed, and their daughter is already home in Tianjin. Many relatives went to Daqing in Heilongjiang to work. They are no longer farmers. \\nIn the 80s, a famous sociologist Feng Youlan invented a statement on farmers entering the city, saying that they cannot leave their homeland. On the surface, it seems to be his defiance of ideology. In fact, this is the essence of Mao Zedong Thought, which limits the development of the market economy from the demographic distribution and structure. Even according to Marxist class point of view Note 3, this is reactionary theory and policy. This policy has blocked rural-to-urban development, and the already closed rural economy towards an open market economy. This is the root cause of China's stagnation for nearly half a century after the victory of the war against Japan. \\nInto the hometown, I and five uncles and cousins and my nephew took a gao incense, and the coins knocked in front of Grandpa's tomb. Before the Cultural Revolution, every Spring Festival, thirty nights, the family was to sacrifice the fathers. Close to midnight, led by my grandmother, first sprinkle wine at the table full of offers, and then burn red paper written ancestors cards, finally, by generation to the ancestor cards on the table kow ceremony. Stand up and then courtesy to the elders, the new year is good. The next is our child's most desirable moment: take some of the supplies for food, while burning firecrackers. The ceremony until 1966, when the Cultural Revolution swept down, stopped for more than 40 years. But that was a sacrifice to my mother's Zhang family. \\nBecause the father was not in the country, the five uncle lost his whereabouts, and I never participated in the sacrifice of my father's Panjia. This is the first time in my life and probably the only one in my life. In the moment I kneel, I was thinking not of grandpa who did not know nothing but felt the power of cultural heritage. The so-called patriotism, the so-called love of Chinese culture, in the end is not the feelings that the customs, habits, morals, life, marriage, farming and earning a living have been deposited in the hearts of living people? There are many things that seem unreasonable today or that year, how many ignorance rules, there are countless blood and tears of life, but that makes up our culture. \\nI did not understand the resurgence of the model play in the Cultural Revolution in the past, because it was a piece of a nightmare. But I then found out that when I heard the revolutionary songs of that year, I felt indiscreetly cordial, because those singing and my youth were inseparable, albeit bitter youth. Now, in front of the tomb of my predecessors, I understand that we cannot be indifferent to the past, whether good or bad, are part of our limited lives. If the past is obliterated, patriotism is nothing more than a ruler a spell that enslaves people and fuses the angry cottage Viagra. \\nIn the past I didn't think it was a superstition, because it had no effect on the dead. Now, in front of the tomb of the foreigner, I understand that this is a ritual that the living man cannot lack. Wouldn't today's memorial service, the oath before the so-called martyrs, use the feelings of those who have passed away to us to inspire those who live? In fact, human beings have instinctive religious emotions, and we always treat dead relatives and friends as they are in another place, can tell them beyond time and space, report to them, promise them, assure them, confess and pray for their forgiveness. This is often unconscious, is not spoken to others, is a very instinctive consciousness activity. It is impossible to ban it, just do not overdo it. \\nThe old four decades ago can not be said to be miserable, not complete. But the so-called four old came back almost overnight in a more exaggerated form. In fact, at the time of the Cultural Revolution, there was no interruption to the sacrifice of the dead, but the change was just to sweeper who \\nPan Wanbo is Grandpa's cousin. Pan Changyou was his father, and my grandfather's uncle. This is the oldest foreman I can go after. If you count from Pan Chang, to my generation, Pan's family has been in Dahuang for four generations. Since my generation, there may be four generations now. Because my dad's age is similar to my father, if I live, it's a hundred years old. \\nMy old aunt Pan Shuya married Zhang Mengfei, died in 1998. I haven't seen her, so far there are no pictures of her. She has nine children, my four cousins and five cousins. Zhang Yunjie is still a farmer, fishing on Lake Chagan is his agricultural work. I went to Lake Chagan to experience his fishing career. Both Yun Jie and his sister-in-law wore rubber pants and shake me and some of his brothers working in town back to the boat one by one. In the middle of the lake there were no nets they placed, but there were not many fish, we only caught a few carps, others were small, and I thought it should be dropped. But he all collapsed and became our dinner. \\nThe so-called Chagan Lake is a reservoir that can not have people, but the area is very large. This is the northeast wetland, commonly known as bubbles. Change with season. It is an important topography of the local ecological balance. My four uncle was found in such blisters. The official conclusion is suicide. But four aunts said it might have been killed and thrown into the bubble, because there was no clay in the fingernails of the remains, it is unreasonable. \\nYunjie fishing shack is very simple, is the northeast dry basement. But their home was good, the floor also had tiles, much better than I lived in Beijing. \\nIn the evening, out of Yunjie's house, looking at a glance, as if in celebration of the sun fell down, Yu Xia lingered in the dark clouds, the red water. The lake is beautiful. This is my hometown. \\nAs the saying goes, three years Hedong, three years Hexi The peasants of Shandong, who have passed on from generation to generation, silently work, cross the Kanto, break the world, through war and turmoil, through brutal movements and famine, nine dead lives, finally reached the 21st century. Looking back, I just want to ask myself, is Hadong better than Hasai? Is that really the choice of our predecessors? (20130725)\\nNote 1: At the time of the death of the elderly, China is usually divided equally. Only sons have the right to inherit, the eldest son has two copies, and one is for the eldest grandson. The daughter has no inheritance because she gave a dowry at the time of her marriage. Such a system makes the accumulated household property dispersed, so there is a claim that three generations are rich. When starting a business, it is impossible to keep up for generations. \\nNote 2: At the end of Qing Han Lin Jiang Kong Yin is Kang Youyou as a disciple. His two grandchildren-Jiang Teng and Jiang Yang, were once an underground worker of the CCP. \\nZhou Enlai instructed Jiang Teng to join the 55th KMT Division 325 regiment as a student during the war of resistance. Later, he went to the industrial and mining areas to carry out labor operations according to the Jiang Teng has been clerk in Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, Limin coal mine and Chongqing Sancaisheng coal mine. In the 1939 Incident in Anhui Province, under the direction of the Party, he launched a strike struggle for the Sancai coal miners. After Japan surrendered, the CCP instructed Jiang Teng to go to Northeast to open up an activity base. In November 1945, through social relations, sent to the Northeast Xi'an Coal Mine (later changed to Liaoyuan Mining Bureau), to receive the secretary of Pan Jiwu. Using this post, he provided many important military information for his entry into the northeast. However, because of the Panhannian case, Jiang Teng was in a difficult situation later. \\nIt seems that Jiang Teng took advantage of my father's relationship. Unfortunately, both parents have passed away and there is no way to check. However, it should be pointed out that my father was a technician throughout his life, and had nothing to do with politics and had not participated in the Kuomintang.

The article says, 'Suppose a shoemaker opened a small shoe shop, because the competition was not the big owner, and the result had to close the door and went to Adrihanov, owner of the ladder Friesskin shoe factory as a hired worker. He went to Adrihanov's factory and did not want to be a hired worker forever, but wanted to accumulate money, make a capital, and then open his shoe shop. This shoemaker's status is already proletarian, but his consciousness is not proletarian consciousness, but a small bourgeoisie consciousness. This proletarian shoemaker felt that it was difficult to accumulate money for a period of time, because the wages received were barely enough to survive. And he saw that opening a shop was not so attractive: paying rent, difficult customers, lack of money on hand, competition, and such troubles. And the proletant can exercise less of this heart. The dream of our shoemaker's little bourgeois was hit for the first time here, creating a sense of proletarian in his heart for the first time.' \\n'After some time, our shoemaker realized that receiving money was not enough to buy what was needed, and an increase in wages was extremely important for him. At the same time, he found out that workers were talking about what union strikes. We, the shoemaker, realized here: to improve his position, we must fight the factory owner rather than open its own footbed. He joined the union, took part in a strike movement, and soon began to embrace socialist ideas.' \\n\\tIt is said that Stalin beautifies his father. According to Stalin, his father was a child of a conscious proletant. And in fact, the shoemaker did not become a conscious proletant, but an irresponsible for his wife and children, who only knew drinking alcohol, Stalin was shamed to mention him throughout his life. But Stalin's claim is at least in line with the dialectical materialism of the existence of a sense of decisionism, and with Mao Zedong's policy of class for sweeping landlords and capitalists. This policy states that 'those who own more than the local average land in the three years before liberation are landowners'. But landowners who have lost their land for decades are not only landowners, but their children actually 'enjoy' landowners. And farmers have been working in cities for decades, and have not yet been recognized as members of the proletarian class, and today they are still known as 'migrant workers'. \\nFrom 'Two Leisure Hall'\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 11"}

When I came back, I started turning the box and looking for information about 'Eight O'clock Poetry House' 25 years ago. It happened to see a letter from Mr. Pan wu. At this time, sir is still. A few days later, when I was surprised that Mr. died, I thought: What is the sign of this letter? \\nIn short, uncomfortable!!! \\nRemembrance of Mr. Shang Kwun Ying (SONG Chi-kang)\\nPhoto as proof! I can't say anything...\\nBrowse the web, come to Hongming blog. Hongming has written 'Miss Shang Guan Ying'. \\nThere is such a paragraph in Hongming Wen: 'Remember 1987 'Ginseng Flower' to engage in poetry community in Jilin Province. Song Zhigang, Jiao Hongxue, etc. sent the manuscript of the 'eight o'clock poetry house', and finally did not see publication. In the first year of the new century, some people said that in front of the Ningjiang District People's Mall found the 'Jilin Poetry Community Special Number' edited by the editorial department of 'Ginseng Flower'. I went to go and disappointed to find this issue or book. \\nThis paragraph coincides with the letter addressed to me by Mr. Pan wu. \\nPhoto attached to the letter from Mr.; it reads as follows:\\nComrade Shigang\\nThe letter and poetry were received early (already), because I was seriously ill, delayed the reply, forgiveness. \\nYour poetry is waiting to be compiled into the Literary Society Works Collection, do not want to remember. \\nPan wu/Saluing/Five, 17 (After receiving the letter, I rushed to see Mr. Longliu, finally because Mr. went to the field I did not depress and return.), \\nMr. Shang Guanying's letter should be dated 17 May 1986. \\nTo raise this matter, it must be said of teacher Wang Xun; because Mr. Shang Guanying letter and Wang Xun teacher supporting the healthy growth of 'eight o'clock poetry society'. That was during the 1986 Spring Festival, I received a letter from Mr. Wang Xun; it reads as follows:\\nZhigang:\\nGood Spring Festival. Spring Festival is busy with the fortieth period (refers to 'Guerrose' literary art. (Song Zhigang Note), concluded his work, and held a meeting in the province, and did not visit the door. A few days ago, three meetings were held: folk literature, the Kanto Sanbao Prize, the Folk Research Council, and the Folk Research Theory Planning Conference, which only returned last night. \\nFor a long time, I spoke with the provincial culture department, the Cultural Union, the Art Museum, the Ginseng flower editorial department, and introduced the situation of 'eight o'clock' and asked them for their support. Ginseng Editor-in-chief has promised to send a special page. I would also like to use the various available gardens to publicize it, because in 1986 there may be a mass creation that will create good public opinion for us, and then took the initiative. \\nTo this end I think: first, immediately set a draft, two, as soon as possible write a bit of various (types), of introduction text: experience type, communication type, introduction type, etc. The faster the better. {Guan Ying, editor of Ginseng Flower may be before and after the Lantern Festival (Guo)}\\nWang Xun/New Year 11th (Here, Song Zhigang on behalf of 'Eight O'clock Poetry Society' salute teacher Wang Xun!! (Also hope that 'eight o'clock poetry society' memoirs have written by Wang Xun!), \\nIn memory of Mr. Shang Guanying, he cannot fail to mention his editor-in-chief, Ginseng Flower Literary Monthly. In August 1981, I suddenly began to create an unsuppressed impulse for Chinese characters. Practice the pen and write some poems of 'self-righteous'. In 1982, the first small tofu block (folk song: 'A way to improve life'), was made in 'Ginseng Flower'. At that time, I had more contact with Xu Jingya and Xu Xiaozhe of Ginseng Flower. Especially at the point of Xu Jingya, my poetry has made a qualitative breakthrough; after that, in 'Ginseng Flower' and 'hometown love', 'flaming sorghum'. About this piece, later on another text. \\nMr. Shangguanying, formerly known as Pan wu, Binxian people in Heilongjiang. CCP member. Since 1946, he has served as Northeast Literary Works Group, Northeast People's Art Theatre, Northeast Writers Association, Jilin Province Literary Union professional writer, editor-in-chief of 'Ginseng Flower' literary monthly magazine. Published works since 1949. Author of literary and art episodes of 'arts and art bullets', book set 'Shadow of the Book', 'Xu Erzao,' 'Han Qingkuan', 'Shangguan-Ying', 'Literary History of the Northeast Occupied Area', etc. \\nMr. Pan wu participated in the Fourth Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army during his teenage period and worked in the Second Cultural Corps. Although only primary school culture, I love reading, collecting books and entering the creations studio. Mr. Pan wu is honest, dare to dare to do. 1958 was beaten as the 'right', delegated to Qian'an for 20 years, the implementation of the policy was returned to the provincial literary work. \\nMr. Pan Lao's life, Tao Li full of the world, disciples all over all walks of life, some people think Mr. Pan Lao likes to receive his adventures, but Mr. Pan wu said: 'I am not good as a teacher, just love, like my children.' Noble mind is admirable. Mr. Pan wu is one of the top ten collectors in Jilin province, love books in his life, tens of thousands of books in their homes, suffer too many people who borrow books, have to put the books by white paper on the cover, and instruct those who borrow books to cherish books, old Mr. love book heart can be seen. \\nI remember Mr. Shang Guanying, in addition to his influence in the literature, but also contains the deep love that Mr. Shang Guanying has poured into 'Eight O'clock Poems House'!!!"}

Through these struggles, the right-wing elements were isolated, the masses polished their eyes and their awareness increased. In the early days of the anti-right struggle, some people were burdened by misstatements or sympathizing with the right, while others were unequivocal or skeptical about anti-right struggles, so they often did not speak out at meetings. Now, the masses in the middle have recognized the ugly face of the right-wing elements, discerning the big deal, taking the initiative to find ways, collecting materials and participating in the anti-right struggle. If Wu Xuecheng made some wrong remarks during the big magnification period, he took a wait-and-see attitude after the anti-right began. Later, with the help of organizational education, especially when others criticized the fallacy of the right with the contrast of old and new societies, he recalled the pain of his life as a wandering life in the old society, recognized the good life of today, and therefore unloaded the burden and actively engaged in the fight.

On the contrary, years later, I will occasionally return to the Mao era of 'carrying a heavy cross, but thirst for the day to enjoy freedom from fear', waking up and rejoicing that is nothing more than A nightmare. But to be sure, it is not only our 'untouchables' that have been scored by previous movements, or ordinary people who are still 'inside the people'. Why did we taste not under the ubiquitous sword of Damoclis? \\nIn 1979, I went back to Peking University to receive my graduation certificate, and met with the Department's office for many years. He remembered me and asked about me, and after I briefly reported on his post-school experience, he said a brief phrase that made me memorable for life: 'Actually, not just you, we are similar to you.' Indeed, teacher Ding has also undergone the 'standard procedure' of 'battered fight-dismissal of party (regiment), nationality (if any)-'downhill (factory), labor'. It is true that little Tolstoy in the title page of 'Two Sisters' reproduced from the Bible 'in clear water three times, bath three times in blood, three times in alkaline water', but most people in New China, especially the stinky old nine people feel personally. \\nIn steel mills, except that I and the Shouyi brothers are the right of students, mostly writers, actors, journalists, editors, painters, announcers, party school teachers, etc., that is, to discipline our decentralized cadres. Later I knew that they also mostly had other problems (including the middle right), or were reluctant to draw boundaries with their right-wing husbands. Decentralized, compared to them, we can only be small right, good for everyone. There are hats, dysentery is not too bright bald, not to say who abandons. Maybe it's sick and pity! I quickly mixed up with the old right. So, except for some, the disciplines are not so hard. \\nTwo agricultural and agricultural workers\\nWorkers have not been a few months, they are going to become farmers. Originally, officials in the province felt that the food basket had become lighter. To let the food basket sink again, they had to have their own farm. Land works well, it is not difficult to allocate a little, but where does the labor force come from? After all, leadership, visionary, immediately reminds us of our very obedient cheap labor. I was honored to be selected back to Wuhan Daiman station, beginning to Wuchang East Lake Mill Mountain (now is a five-star tourist scenic spot, but there is still a lot of small desert hills), opened a few acres of wasteland, but because of the wrong season, can only plant red potato (potato). It is also strange that in the summer of 1959, Wuhan was hot, the land was dry and fire, we pick water and drought every day, the red potato did not die, but most of the harvest was thin and small crappy goods, it seems that crops are also fooled. About the early war is not fast, seeing the right-wing big team will be back immediately, the mill land is too little to be used. In the winter of 1959, we were instructed to turn to the east of a large wilderness mountain, the Shouyi brothers stayed in the East Lake Laohu, and I was divided into the carpentry class of the infrastructure team, and since then I started my new life as well as agricultural workers. \\nAt the beginning of the construction, always three links, the first is to repair the road, we use pickaxe, shovel, flat burden, of course, sledgehammer and steel brazing, hard in a week on the ridge out of a car lane. I do not want to mention how tired, anyway is not bright out of work, with the stars back, three meals are eaten on the site, back to the farmhouse (not time to take a shed, borrow the old hometown), wash does not want to wash, fall to sleep. After the road repair, a large number of building materials were shipped, and the infrastructure team officially started construction. Because they are raw hands, invited two masters, one for each clay. With bamboo, reed mat, linoleum on the hillside to take a shed, after skillful ride quickly, not long took a large piece. In the early spring of 1960, the large forces entered, officially hanging out the brand of 'Xuannong Ranch in Hubei Province', has set up agricultural, pig raising, infrastructure and other professional teams, big fist, deserted houses, a hot leap into the new weather. \\nIn the first half of 1960 to the wind and rain, the slope wasteland also turned into a row of vegetable fields. It seems that there's probably a good harvest this time. But I didn't expect that after summer, a rare tornado completely shattered this dream. Remember that day was very hot, the evening began to lightning thunder, into the night more thunderstorm, undirected winds blow our reishi mat shed straight shaking, bowl mouth thick bamboo columns, beige ring. The capital team captain asked us to hold a pillar and want to go over. But the wind is more scratched, the shed finally fell. Thanks to the Ashiki roof has long been rolled 780 fall, everywhere, everyone drilled out the roof, risking downward rain, deserted road, wet running down the mountain, heavy rain, water flow on the slope like a river, we are rolling, tough water rushed to the foothills of the site. After the rain stopped the next day, go out for a look, alas! It was really devastated. Although the collapsed bamboo shed was expected, but the mud and gravel rushed down on the mountain were also washed down by mud and gravel (a few years later, I joined the Dongchuan Mud Flow Control Team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and I realized that this should be called 'mudslides'), rushed to 780, and months of hard work went into. East flow,Fortunately we still eat the emperor food,Non-farm households with wages (living expenses),Or really want to have dinner。 \\nWe are anxious, the public servants who want food basket aggravated also hurry, it seems that the wasteland on the slopes do not expect much, or change it again! Exactly, when the Great Leap Forward in 1958, Wuhan launched the majority of the military and civilian population to build land in the East West Lake Wai Lake on the northern suburbs of Hankou, with a view of the infinite bottom of the lake that is rich So the provincial party party propaganda department in there plotted a large plot, late autumn 1960, the former station of the infrastructure team was maneuver, across the Yangtze River, straight to the East Lake also. \\nThree, turn to East West Lake\\nJust to the new battlefield, looking at the sight of the wilderness (reed), reed wasteland, think of the failure of the first two business, can really be a bit confused, I do not know how luck this time? Because there is no farmer, there is no room for accommodation, ten dozen mae station (two masters have already left, full master!), Just squeezed in a tent and started a third business. \\nHere is a horse Hirakawa, and just in Han (mouth), Xiao (Gan), highway, convenient transportation. But what is easy to talk about a silt like black soil, repair a car path to the proposed site department? Well, but half a mile, count, the roadside is the yard, a trip to move! It is still a bamboo shed, a light car, soon erected a row of work shed, and started to build the brick and wood site. Then the large troops entered, and the production began. \\nIn order to improve the quality of the food basket, the pavement of farm pastures is large, in addition to the original professional teams, adding cattle and sheep, beekeeping duck, side-industry (winemaking), teams. East Lake is a good place, a spade down, turned out black soil bright, said to have no fertilizer for three years. Lake grass is not fishing (and nowhere to fish), Shouyi brothers from plants (lake grass), learn to animals (cattle and sheep), soon practiced a good craft of sheep, also many times for cattle and sheep delivery, end is a young veterinarian, I listened to him imitating the cows and sheep, male, mother and bulb lamb, the tone Each is different, but beautiful, is for one. \\nThe infrastructure team is not just a worker, it is also a farmer, and we have not done much of our other work. Because the other teams are working, we are left in the field dance (mud), knife axe, so loading and unloading live is not allowed. At the beginning I was just a small labor, red brick a piece of more than 5 pounds, others once pick 24 pieces, still run fast, I shake and shake can only pick 16 pieces, good guys are very handout, not laughing at me. But soon I caught up, after moving bricks in the Han River, can also 24 blocks of brick a few miles (left and right shoulder change). Recently saw the strong brother sent 'memories of past events', said that he was then down to Sichuan Ziyang, known as the kingdom of Tianfu, to eat in the commune hall, Dun is red potato with sweet potato (red potato alias), cranberry belly, but also to carry stones on the mountain road, I don't know how he got over. Compared to him, I was lucky, and the amount of labor was large, but unflattened. Field leadership is really good, according to the actual type of work instead of according to the old five (land, rich, anti, bad, right), reported, for the 'field staff' to get quantitative according to the type of work, clay carpentry is 38 pg/month, vegetable farmers is 35 pg/month. Of course, the food tickets cannot reach their own hands, but at least they will not eat food. In addition to the abundant supply of farm vegetables, in addition to half a kilogram of meat prescribed by Wuhan, the animal husbandry team occasionally contribute some meat and tooth sacrifice, so we can really not be hungry to the stomach, epidemic diseases (puffiness, hepatitis), are not much. \\nEast Lake low-lying terrain, afraid of flooding is not afraid of drought, in addition to deepening the drainage gutter, pumping pump is particularly important. Since we are a loading and unloading team, the pump is naturally alive. A pump, along with diesel engine and sleeper rack, there are thousands of pounds, eight people carry, each person stalls more than a hundred pounds, shouting slowly walk, seems OK. But Tanabe trail muddy, sometimes flooded, simply invisible, we are often a deep and shallow touch, shoulder weight is also time and light. If you feel that bamboo bars are not weight, then don't be happy, will immediately double back, there are several times hard to press my beans big sweat beads a straight down, but bite tooth to hold, really can't eat, will find a flat place to rest. \\nOnce to the farm busy, it must be the whole mobilization, especially in the midsummer double grab season, cut (early), valley planting (late), seedling, but that is two unseen days, four meals (Tim a night supper), are solved in the field. Transplanting to the end we all feel like a broken waist, hate to kneel. Wari valley is a light saving, must be left to the old and weak women and children dry, but we are rod labor, responsible for picking 'straw' (rice with spike), on (valley), duo. The rice field is far from the valley, there are several miles, the road is far from light burden ah, every time the work is tired like a scattered frame, legs can not lift up. With a punch (two sides with iron tip flat burden), pick the grass is also very careful, must be two ends almost double, plug the grass head, first aim a bundle of straw, strenuous insertion, still high up, with the other head to insert another bundle of similar size. In order to avoid the spike down will sprinkle down, the shoulder can not be put down, after a gas pick up the valley, stacking the wooden ladder is steep, ladder has to rush a handful of escalators, lest fall down. Remember a few times it has rained, but the head of the grass has not been picked up, the wet grass is poured more and more dull, it is not easy to put on the top of the stack, suddenly unloaded the load of the kilo, deeply spit a breath, ah! It's easy but memorable for a lifetime. \\nFourth, 'be transformed' the life phase\\nSince we are not part of the people, labor is naturally not an end, but a means to transform us. But speaking of conscience, until now I still don't understand, how can I unlock 'Hu Feng is a counter-revolution?' 'Is democracy a means or an end?' 'Is bad effect is impure motivation?' Wait, what about the 'Sphinx Mystery' that drove me into 'masculine' Every day from working in the morning to the evening, there is little time to think except for three meals. In addition to weekly studies scheduled in the evening (reading or criticizing each other), most people prefer to put the gantry or coveted on the pave (sleep time is prescribed), and do not want to reveal scars. Recently read some of the memoirs of 'former (or 'original', can't remember), right-wing (but this is the new crown for us in a red head file in Yunnan Zhaotong, never fabricated under), lamenting his (her), misfortunes, but also deeply rejoicing the transformation environment in which he (her), suffered. \\nIn relative terms, the leadership of Xuannong Ranch in Hubei Province is still good. The main director is named Xiao, the guerrilla captain was born, and it seems that ink does not eat much, words and deeds, and still keep the habit of the year. For the first time, they felt that these leaders were meticulous and laughing, the strings of class struggle seemed to be very tight, but after maturing, they found that they were still relatively moderate privately. Chang Xiao often revealed some of his regret for the talents of the old and right, and two things changed my view of him. In the spring of 1960, we also fought on the deserted hillside of Wuchang. Several new intellectuals came to work and exercise, divided into the cafeteria to help chefs. Seeing those of us right, the boundaries are very clear, but it is a little bit eloquent to make the momentum, but it is a different group with me, ignoring them. But one day at the general meeting, when he talked about the right transformation issue, he suddenly made a big thunder, naming criticism of a certain youth knowledge too much like words. It turned out that this monster had asked a pig in the canteen, a few could be the old editor of his grandfather had poured his foot wash water for him. Shaw Chang said that although the right has made mistakes in politics, as long as the transformation is good, there is still a future, and the right is also human, not to be humiliated. This can bring these few young people back to the original shape, and later there is much more honest. \\nJia Jun, an optics professor (researcher), who returned home from Cambridge University, also accidentally entered the shell of 'Yang Mou'. In 1960, the farm organization studied 'Viva Leninism'. He turned out to be 'a great exotic word', openly doubting whether socialism must prevail over capitalism. I pinch the sweat for this old professor, and I didn't expect to say at the whole conference that Jia Jun thought was really reactionary, but he had revealed the real thought, and the capitalist country came back, reactionary thought was not easy to change. Moreover, although he was the largest in the right, he was very labor-intensive. Seriously, never lazy, stronger clouds than some young people, there seems to be a good taste of reviews. So, I didn't do anything about Jia Jun later, a wind wave calmed down. \\nSince labor is only a means to transform us, the transformation of our farm farm will not relax. If you don't work overtime at night, sit in a row on the chase shop with a semi-dark pony lamp, or listen to the supervisor to read important articles (such as the editorial on the Red Flag), or prepare each person's self-criticism (rectification summary), or a weekly, monthly meeting (that is, criticism and self-criticism). In short, daytime labor, night makeover is. As for the rest of the workshop, that can be a casual chat time, listening to them all kinds of anecdotes in the north of the South China Sea, from the secret notes of famous actors to eight dishes, extremely long knowledge. \\nThe behavior of these cultural people when they opened a summary meeting or year-end appraisal meeting (that was a major play), was very interesting. They were actually acting, but I didn't understand it at that time, but afterthought, that really admire home, in one word, mutual protection is better than biting each other! Also in the well, want to rely on someone else's shoulders out of the well will be angry, the consequences will not be better, only mutual help is the best strategy. So, when you talk about their own crimes, we are sad and heartfelt; when criticizing others, digging deep roots are just right, analyzing the motives are well organized and silky; but in the end, when everyone's group comments are to be written (this is the key, the front is only set), but the words are refined and repeatedly modified, Give full play to the rich features of Chinese language, and strive to achieve a satisfaction. The whole process, can be described as a storm and rain suddenly becomes drizzle, raised high, gently down to describe, most relevant. For example, in the autumn of 1959, while still working in Wuchang Mashan, Director Wu suddenly talked to me (then afraid of leading individual conversations, there was a woes), saying that someone picked up a letter with a problem with the content, doubting that I had not sent and lost it, hoping I would be clear. I was unable to touch the mind, I could not remember that I had written and lost a letter full of dissatisfaction. Actually, because when I arrived in Hubei, I was criticized for communicating with right-wing classmates, knowing that we did not enjoy 'freedom of communication', so I was very careful to write a letter on weekdays. How could I write such a letter? What about falling into the hands of leaders? Of course I deny it, but I do not dare openly confronted with the leadership, in case I really lose the letter, and there are some words in them that are overstated to some extent? After the best solution, only ask the leaders to show me the letter to solve the doubts. However, the strange thing is that there has been no echo, everything seems to have passed, but I am bitter, I am like the one in the intersection who dropped the second shoe upstairs, see heaven waiting to open my critical meeting! At the end of the year, I also considered whether to say this, but I did not know how to say it, so finally decided not to mention it. At the summary meeting, we made a lot of comments on my self-summary, but did not mention the deadly 'letter', I thought that the comment would not be good, but surprisingly, the comment really can, in addition to a sentence 'holding their young, unconscious burden', there is no negative thing, of course, There is no need to add a few words of hope and work in the future, and to strengthen transformation, and other classic concluding remarks. Until today, I still didn't know the letter that confused me for months. What exactly is going on? \\nActually, when I was right at school, I really didn't understand why I was an anti-party? I just raised some questions about some issues that I could not understand at the opening of my class. I signed a school number in some big print newspapers, and expressed my disunderstanding of Yang Lu and other delineated right-wing parties! Perhaps the question is my only big print, 'Is Marxinism Constant Equal to Truth?', which believes that Marxism does not embrace all truths, and that there are reasonable cores in idealism philosophy (like Hegel's dialectical law)? (Criticizing me on the platform is high). But after coming to Hubei, especially after listening to these cultural people who criticized their 'anti-party crimes', I was a little obedient. Originally, they can say that most of their problems have nothing to do with party policies. They all have opinions on a leader of this unit. They have different views on a certain job in this unit, and they are wrong (the term 'stand the wrong team' at that time seems to have not been created), the serious point is that understanding the double hundred policy is wrong, propagating The bourgeois decayed thought and so on. It is simply not involved in the policy and policy of the Party Central Committee. Wu Junyuan is the head of the literary group of provincial publishing house (since 1979 was the Director of the Provincial Institute of Literature, President of the Provincial Calligrapher Association), one of its main crimes is to the old martial arts novelist to Kairan (pseudonym Pingjiang not zodiac, Jianghu Fairy fire red Lotus Temple author). Yanan Lu Yi's editor-in-chief, Ms. Jiang, was designated as the head of the right group of provincial publishing houses, followed her editors in a logical way. Ms. Dai on the radio, because she rejected the pursuit of party books, became the right woman of the opposition party. It seems that compared to him (her), I have a lot of words, and I do not count against my right. \\nIn 1959, the 10th anniversary of the 'founding of the nation', the Central Committee decided to amnesty a group of war criminals and remove some of the right-wing hats that performed well. I knew my performance. Naturally, I didn't think about it until the end of 1961, when the third batch of caps was picked up, I did not jump out of the 'right' column, and since then I said goodbye to the living expenses of 2,75 big hairs per month. Can be eligible for a salary (enough to have 530 gross too!), too. Remember, when the list was announced, the vast majority of those on the list were not very excited. Because, after all, we have not been confused to forget our identity, in fact, we are simply going from the 'right' collection to the 'hat-picking right' collection. The leopard head of the Water Margin, the gold mark on the face can not be removed, the most patch plaster, 'pick the cap' is a block of plaster, can be removed at any time, what is called 'hat in the hands of the masses, can be put on you at any time', just like the Indian caste, the untouchables are not able to take off. It is because I never forget my 'untouchables collection', after being transferred back to Wuhan Mechanics Institute, I never dare to forget (I never had to remember), so it was safe to spend the future movements. Of course, all the labor exercises, the descendant, as an old athlete, I have never been forgotten, but I'm still very happy. Because, not to talk about mental stress, that is, its labor intensity, is also far worse than the farm ranch, come to a model play: 'Have you (farm ranch), this bowl of wine mat bottom, what kind of wine I can deal with.' \\nWrite here,Suddenly remembered an episode,In early 1971, I just returned from a railway landslide site in Yibin,Spring Festival returned to Shanghai,Only a few days to Shanghai,I came to the Telegram,I want to return immediately,For this reason my mother was especially nervous,I asked again whether I said what I shouldn't say Words, what mistakes have been made, and so on, I can myself all these years. I was always shrunk with the tail, even in 1967, when the villains were in power and fighting teams, I insisted on being a runaway. In that year, there was a chance that the Botanical Garden had fought in the farm ranch 'hat-picking right' Feng Jun (he was ten years old older than me), and he was a small leader of a rebellion for his positive response to the unprecedented launch of the great leader himself. Perhaps it was hot (in fact, late autumn), he actually said to participate in what 'right-wing screening'. But I was like a water stop, not at the moment. At that time, I also pinch sweat for him, and expected him about bad prospects. Certainly, shortly after, Wuhan's villains flags dispersed, and he was said to have reworked Chu prisoners. In addition, during the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionaries in the country grabbed the revolution in the premises, I mostly promoted production at various sites, from mudslides to landslides, from Yunnan to South Sichuan. Plus participating in many ad hoc exploration missions, what kind of thought and others? With my doubts, I immediately returned to the house around the third year. Just walked into the door, I saw the wall filled with a big red application. The original was to respond to the call of the great leader's 57, and to fight when the 57 fighters went into the country and went into the squad, can these good things be missing me? So busy with a red paper wrote an application that insisted on making a big difference, looking for an empty block sticker out, and gave Shanghai a safe long-distance telephone call. Unfortunately, the application is still late. The first list of the first batch has been announced. The above is written by the leadership (actually the military representative of the left), research, accepting the application of the following comrades as glorious 57 fighters. Of course, I am famous on the list. After all, the military representatives are at a high level. I know me too well. Without having to apply, I know that I will definitely insist on this honor. In a few days, the mighty 57 army departed from Wuhan and went straight to the vast world-Nanzhang, remember that the branch convoy was also equipped with doctors and nurses. The original 57 fighters had a long illness, and even had a disability (not the highest instruction had 'except the old and weak disabled'? How else???), , or the leaders want to be thoughtful ah! \\nidle a lot, plan to collect a pen. As for the experience of joining the 'hat-picking right' collection, do not want to windy, in a word: a lot of miscellaneous work, good. A number of articles, the number of (promotion of the title), is mostly. \\nSmall spotter\\nThe kid's name is Pan yaoxiang, Changzhou ancestral origin; Songhu war, 1937, parents fled, diepei displacement;\\nChangsha raw me, all the way to the west.

It is not appropriate to think that there are not many anti-revolutionaries coming out of Shandao, but many comrades who fought wrong, and therefore doubt the achievements of rebellion. We don't talk about any theory. Just think about it, that is, only one counter-revolutionary will put fire in the mountains. Isn't it possible to burn all of us? Put this 'one' out, the results are also brilliant! \\nIt should also be certain that the mistakes of Mountain's counterproductive work are great. Mistakes become a fact, wrong is wrong. The Party Committee has done the work of 'wrong must be rectified', and we recall every day the grievances suffered, and the hearts are undulating, and he doesn't mean anything. There are a lot of new things every day in the sun, not more worthy of our attention? The problem is: Party leaders are not profoundly aware of mistakes, pacification is not clear, this inevitably everyone has emotions! Now, when the party is going to carry out the wind on the eve, it makes sense to help the Party leadership analyze it. \\n'anti-summary' in the 'fight' object divided into six types, and finally pointed out that 'fighting wrong' was only nine people. That is to say: except nine people are 'fighting right', there is no mistake. I think it should be divided into two categories: there is no mistake. Those who could be said to be counter-revolutionaries at the time, and later did not oppose anti-revolutionary theists because of policy liberalization, fell into this category. Second, are all wrong. In this category, two main items can be divided:\\n1, politically doubtful, or reported by someone;\\n2, without the above situation and the Party Committee decided to fight. The first class, the person who was fought should have nothing to say;\\nItem 2 of the second category is entirely a mistake of the Party Committee, and there is no room for debate. The argument may be the first of the second category. Party committee leaders can say, 'Do you have questionable conditions? How is it wrong?' The one who was fought can say: 'The results of the investigation research, I have no political problems, no historical problems, one out of two white, how is it good?' Finally, I think the party committee leader wants to say, 'Is it not asking to be bold in doubt?' The core of the problem is here. \\nBold skepticism should be combined with research. The bold skepticism without research is the mentalism method of work. This point, the party committee leader comrade was examined afterwards. Comrade Gao Yunchang, secretary of the Party Committee, said in the Chinese department apologized: 'The campaign is running very hastily, preparation work is poor. If you have time to investigate and study it first, you will not apply the fight method.' In this case, there may be more than one person, maybe more than three or five. But why not summarize this deep experience in practice in relation to the facts? Intentions, may be considering written in the summary, you have to admit that the number of people wrong is too many, will affect bad. If this is the idea, it's really 'smart' over fire! You want! The beginning of the method was wrong, and the results proved to be wrong, do not fall into the 'wrong' category, where? Some comrades are said to have asked the party committee, 'Am I fighting wrong?' The party committee said: 'it was wrong.' In this way, he thought it was one of the '9 people' in the 'anti-war summary'. However, according to some statistics, such a number of people is already the number of '9' can not be opened. The inexplicable saying is good: 'water is not smooth, words do not work', say it out to admit mistakes, 'wind calm waves, wide sky'. \\nIt is worth our attention: 'bold suspicions' without considerable research are forced by 'bold assumptions'; serious research after the struggle is the practice of 'careful proof'. Of course, our method of work is fundamentally different from the reactionary 'scholar' Hu Shi called 'bold hypothesis, carefully seeking proof'; however, even if there are similarities at some point, isn't it worth our deep vigilance? Now that some units are still carrying out 'anti-counter', they have accepted this lesson. Why don't we write it in the summary yet? Experience is derived from practice, and nothing begins without mistake (can't be identified), much more. If Party committee leaders can face up to mistakes, admit mistakes, summarize mistakes, and I think the masses can also look at problems from development, they will have less emotions. Otherwise, the leadership of the Party Committee said on the one hand 'good fighting'; on the one hand, 'because of the poor theoretical level, the policy level is low, it has not drawn the boundaries of the enemy', this is a big contradiction! \\n'Counteracting Summary', it is entirely right to affirm that 'rebellion' should launch the masses. But how should the masses be mobilized? How to master the mass movement? The Party Committee did not know when he made a 'summary'. I think there are two things that should be noted at the lowest: First, launching the masses is to participate in the fight on a conscious basis, not to use 'pressure' to let him carry out the subjective intent of leadership. Many comrades said, 'At that time, I don't want to be right, I want to get their head, who is not afraid!' Think about this without great bias and errors? Second, the current regularity in the popular movement should not be overlooked and made the masses tail. Some 'activists', who are the core figures in the movement, have a little bit of selfishness, they will mess up the sport. If some comrades are added to the crime of 'no need' to be determined to fight, the leader decides the fight, the result is 'fight well!' The fight was wrong! Some comrades now ask the party committee what is the reason why I was fighting? Why did the party committee decide to fight? The party committee said: 'At that time confused his mind.' 'confuse your mind.' Why not summarize it yet? Is it like Zheng Banqiao like 'rare confused' four words? \\nIn the 'anti-counter summary', only certain that a group of activists emerged in the movement is a brilliant achievement, it is some one-sided. Activists should be recognized and encouraged. If not, who is still active? But activists can also be divided into several categories, not equal to the same amount. Some activists have done what they should not, that is, 'sure' should also be 'negative', right? For example, the leadership suspected that I had a relationship with Lu Ying, Dou Dou. The search is not yet the scope of doubt. I had the freedom to learn at that time. I have freedom of movement, and I have freedom to march... which proves that I'm not sure I'm a counter-revolutionary. However, Comrade Liu Pan yingshuxi published an article in the Qingdao Daily, saying 'anti-revolutionaries'. May I ask, on what basis does he have such a right? It was the Party Committee instructed to do this, and the Party Committee should review it; it was his own inventions, should he also point out that he should receive some education? Shortly after he published that article, he published the article 'I want to apply to join the party' in the school journal. If we don't have to look at the problem, how should we look at it? One female party comrade once mentioned that in the 'summary' we should talk about educating activists, I think it is more comprehensive than 'veteran cadres' look at the problem. I sincerely hope to check this in the wind, because we give up education of activists has become one of the factors of disunity within the people! \\nIn the Countermeasures Summary, it is a profound lesson to check teachers and classmates for violations of the law. The party leadership confessed this mistake and showed a spirit of pragmatism. However, the party committee leaders ignored this education for all party members of the State University. For example, when the Chinese language union was elected in 1956, after the election of chairman and member, Party member Xing Fuchong worked as an 'organization'. He said: 'This half year has not been a long time, the team leader is still as usual. No need to be re-elected.' We also only call it. This year he went to Shanghai Fudan University to study, and the former trade union chairman asked him: 'What else is there to do in the organization?' He said, 'No'. We nodded over. Will you not be able to change the team leader for 'not long'? This is not the case for trade unions in other sectors. May I ask, after the first half of the year, should I not choose the head of the team in this half? Engage in 'organizing work' even forgot! The election work after the re-election of the trade union is a matter of 'law'. This young comrade of the party member ignores this issue! Here, does not yet reflect the Party leadership's understanding of 'illegal' is not deep enough? Of course, we should also carefully review: in the past understanding of everything the party members did is to carry out everything instructed by the party committee leadership, and the attitude of 'only call' 'nodding past'. Some comrades said humorously: your three presidents are vase presidents, and two are aimed at 'rebelling' aftercare work. Come on, a gentleman from the language group took a chair at the election. It wasn't actually asking you to identify something. ! Is that true? There is no root talk, not enough, but the masses have such a reflection, it is also worth the leadership's thinking! \\nFinally, I would like to talk about the conclusions that have been drawn on the 'anti-counter' target, and the 'conclusion' is generally correct. But there are ambiguous places in the text, 'stand the wind' and 'stand foot' taste is quite strong. Should it be re-checked too? If the word is not right, it will make people who get the 'conclusions' forever upset, or calm their mood and concentrate on working towards the socialist construction cause! Others, such as the clutter of working methods during the 'fight against', and afterwards the responsibility of some leading comrades (once said to someone, we didn't want to fight you, because the masses must fight, only fight!), ... and so on, should not be overlooked as trivial. \\nProblems of this fundamental nature, problems of principle, I hope the party committee leaders agree to conduct serious checks in the process of winding, and to check the side change. If not, it will make our party's soul fade away! I make the above statement with a love calling for 'return of the soul'.

You are invited to attend the symposium on May 18 at 2 p.m. and wish to prepare comments, to attend at that time. \\nI read this 'notice' after the mood, really a little 'spring warm and cold' taste. Feeling 'warm' is that our leadership should also implement the policy of 'all flowers, one hundred family contested' policy; feeling cold, is speculate that there is also concern on the leadership. Look! In this Notice, one of the 'sectarianism' in the middle of the 'three major' was deleted, so I don't reveal some news! Can't the party leaders find out that there is 'sectarian sentiment'? Is it said that the party committee leaders could not find the fact that there was 'sectarian sentiment'? I see not yet loud answer: 'No!' This way to draw a circle let everyone 'sing' 'put', it is no wonder some comrades-\\nWant to 'Ming' also off, want to 'put' also off. \\nHowever, after all, under the leadership of the Party Committee, 'Ming' 'put up'. However, there are still a lot of comrades who have concerns. Look! The non-party leadership cadres of various universities (such as Zhengzheng, Vice Chancellor, Provost, Dean, etc.), openly 'Ming' and 'put' in newspapers are big people. What about us? A 'little morning star' criticism, can not write. Look! In various forms of symposia, many comrades have to wear their boots, before speaking, or to explain that the party leadership is correct, great, or say that my words are 'from the desire for unity'. After the speech, I should say, 'Opinions are not necessarily correct, only for the reference of leaders.' While we listen to the language of 'wind and rain', we also hear the 'heart's abacus' ringing. Look! Some comrades wanted to cite some specific facts about internal contradictions in preparation for their next statement, but also went to the party leader to explain what I would like to speak. Look! Some units have not held talks until today, heh... so, and so on, say that the clouds with concern exist, should not be unfounded. \\nThe key in leadership! \\nI hope that the party committee leader will make a public statement on the May 17 'Notice' in the school journal to break the concerns of the masses, let everyone talk openly and make a sharp revelation against the 'Three Kingdoms'!

Pan yongbao Yongbao, a right-wing member and technician of the Water Supply and Drainage Design Institute, defamed the Communist Party 'not for the ordinary people', but 'for its own interests.' He also hopes that US imperialism will provoke the Third World War and take advantage of the opportunity to push the Communist Party down. Wang, a right-wing member and engineer at the Civil Architectural Design Institute, was originally an anti-revolutionary with blood debt. After being lenient by the government, not only did not repent itself, but instead took advantage of the opportunity of the Party's reckoning, inciting opponents to attack the party, and viciously stigmatizing the anti-movement as 'capturing the wind.' Another right-wing member and engineer of the Water Supply and Drainage Design Institute, Huang Guangde, abused the Communist Party member 'is the worst quality person in the world'. The leading cadres of the design institute are all 'people who do not study without skills'; Ji Yuguang, a right-wing member in the Materials Department of Materials and Materials Department of Materials, inciting Party cadres inside and outside the Party to attack the party, said The party is 'dark and dark'. 'The Communist Party is not as good as the feudal dynasty,' he also distorted the facts that peasants 'lives are fundamentally No improvement. Another right-wing activist, Lee Zongmin, criticized 'there is no truth in the world' and criticized 'communism soon'. He proposed that democratic parties should take turns in power, oppose public-private partnerships against capitalist businesses and businesses, and support the fallacy that the right-wing leader is the so-called 'fixed rate is not exploitation, it is not to gain'. Ma Xiangrui, personnel clerk of the right-wing elements of the company, described the Party's general branch as 'small groups, small sects' in order to separate the relationship between the Party and the masses. Xue Wei, deputy director of the Transportation Department of the Public Utilities Administration and a right-wing activist in the Party, sang a peace with the right elements outside the party, and both sides should join forces to attack the party. He viciously slandered: 'After the national liberation, the Communist Party has done nothing bad.' \\nNow, the majority of the right-wing elements have taken a sense of rhetoric and have to bow to the people to plead guilty."}

This is probably to refer to Mr. Pang's unrestrained nature, unconventional, excitement, success and failure. His best friends in his life talk, suave, both sharp, and ancient hot intestines, even his image is quite uncommon, thin figure, suit leather, mouth often title a Cuban cigar, even in the heap of the foreign people is still a crane flock. However, it seems that there is no shortage of points of reference. Indeed, his life is worth remembering and remembering. \\nTurning over the history of the Chinese Red Cross Society, attentive people will find that, in the early days of the resistance, this thin figure, ran up and down the river, drove in the north and south, in wartime, three-in-one realization, organized ambulance groups, formed wounded soldiers hospital, carried out medical supplies, delivered medical supplies, and spoke on radio Play to publicize the spirit of the Red Cross and other aspects of discouragement, diligent, play Outstanding organizational liaison skills. Taking only the Suiyuan Resistance War as an example, December 2, 8, 12, 17 of December 1936, the 'Declaration' continuously reported the movement and remarks of Dr. Peng Jing Zhou north and south, at a time became the focus of social concern. \\nHis life is 69, his life is not long, but from his 29-year-old head of Tongde Medical College dean affairs, went to Germany to get a doctorate, several times, to serve as vice president of the Shanghai Medical Association, the secretary general of the Chinese Red Cross Society, and responsible for Chongqing air raid and rescue, deep into the area in charge of the Miasma prevention and control... A lifetime seems to have completed the career of some people for several lives. This is what he proudly proudly 'Concentrated Theory of Life': 'Life has the length of life, but I can do more than every day, but I live fifty years old.' The spirit of this 'day as a man' did indeed permeate his life. When we further study the context of his life career, it is not difficult to find that behind this desperate Sanro-like spirit, there is a deep humanistic value orientation as the backbone of concern for people's suffering, humanity and fraternity. In the early 30s, Mr. Pang was regarded as 'sea celebrities', with his skills in medical profession, to his side by the same window, friends, doorman of the upper social circles, to the opportunities he can get... He is not unable to fortune, can not fly yellow, can not rise, and he just choose A lot of ordinary people can do, do not want to do things. Even after liberation, even if beaten as the right still strives to play its power in medical education, research and the dissemination of health knowledge, this clear division of the choice of action reveals a light on the nature of others. \\nIn today's call for social justice and harmony and rebuilding the spirit of the Red Cross, a review of the life and cause of the Suzhou Red Cross predecessors is designed to illuminate people's minds with this light of humanity, especially in the social atmosphere of the rising utilitarian society. That might be the point of writing this article. \\n'Be wise, inspirational and unrestrained'\\nLearn about Dr. Pang jingzhou, can not fail to speak from his early family background. On the one hand, the family environment breeds his unique personality, and on the other hand, he can find out why he chose medicine and specialize in tropical diseases such as diarrhea. Dr. Pang Jing Zhou ancestral residence in Wujiang Tongli. Grandfather Pang Qinglin for the former Qing Jin, known as the small Yagong, has been the director of the criminal His father Pang Yuanqi, the word Jia Sun, only weak crown that made filial lian. Pang Yuanqi married Changzhou Wang Feng's wife. Fung is a unique woman, very open-minded and deeply aware of the situation, and has been respected by the whole family. At the beginning of the last century, she was able to see new learning gradually, not to follow the usual flow, no longer let her sons respect confucianism, but let them accept new ideas and new knowledge. In her warm, open family education atmosphere, all three sons learned to make a difference. The eldest son guojun, the word Hengxiang, has been a man in calligraphy; two children, word Dunmin, has been the first to develop and vaccinate smallpox vaccines to become a famous microbiologist; and three countries pick, the word Jingzhou, is the protagonist of this article. \\nBorn in 1897, Pang jingzhou was born in 1897. He was able to literate at the age of two, can make sentences at the age of three, is regarded as a genius child Thanks to the youngest among the brothers, get a special pampering mother. His mother's approach to education is quite different, and it can be summed up as: 'Be wise and inspirational, inspirational and unrestrained, but make self-regulation and choose what is good.' Pangjing Zhou grew up in this way of teaching, independent consciousness is strong, cool, talented, decisive action. But the favorable family conditions and the open education of his mother also caused him certain contradictory personality, such as: including modesty but exposed, knowledgeable and unwilling, willing to 'give yourself' but do not necessarily know how to 'be human'; in the academic field, although it is able to humility; but often book business angry, contending, but Reason for rope, talk about, not let 'authority', disregard jealousy. \\nDuring his life, friends who knew him particularly appreciated him, while those who were not familiar with him did not understand him, prone to misunderstandings or guilt. \\nWhen Pangjing was five years old, his father suffered from malignant dysentery. This disease, which is common today, was no cure at that time, and saw a very talented and ambitious man running away in the early 30 years of age. The early death of his father gave the young Pangjing Zhou a great shock. He said many times later to the people around him, 'My father should not have died.' It buried the seeds of aspiration to medicine in his heart and became an important factor in determining the trajectory of his life. To that end, he dropped out of school 10 years later from Suzhou's best secondary school, Caoqiao High School, and went to the German-run Tongji Medical College alone; in 1921, he graduated from Tongji University, which was run by the Chinese, and began his career as an independent medical practitioner; in summer of 1925, he and businessman Huang Chujiu rushed to the first aid epidemic Hospital; his PhD thesis in Germany in 1935 was 'Impacts of Dysentery in China and Its 'The Fight Problem' holds the deep sense of remembering his father; in the midst of the war of resistance, he rushed to the Burma railway site where falciparum malaria was endemic, and was responsible for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Until later years, he still struggled to study medical history and published articles such as 'A General History of Malaria in China', 'History of Tuberculosis' and other articles. It can be said that he sublimates the pain of a person's young age into a sense of social responsibility to save life with medical care, and to practice it throughout his life. \\nPangjing was 11 years old, to overdeclare one year old, entered the first middle school of Suzhou Province-Caoqiao middle school at that time. This study life has been a deep mark on the life experience of Pangjing Zhou, which largely determines his interpersonal circles. Like a British school entrance stone engraved: 'What kind of person you are, just see who you are reading with and you can know.' In Caoqiao Middle School, he Wen Li and Sheng, although later practising medicine, has always been a good man, with the same window as Wu Hufan, Gu Jie-gang, Ye Shengtao, Wang Boxiang, Jiang Xiaobi, Fan Yanqiao and other literary arts. In the literary circle to cook a night talk, reading monuments, singing, almost became his habit of life. While dealing with a literary person, he also often appears in the press in short articles or poems. In addition to the medical aspects, most of them are cynical humor. The same window evaluates that he is a literary person in the doctor, a professional among the literary people. The friendship with these friends in the window runs through his life through the last years. \\n'Medicine should serve the civilian population'\\nFrom the beginning of his graduation from Tongji, Pangjing Zhou, 24, opened his own Western medicine clinic on the beach. Opened four or five years, his fame became known for dare to use heavy drugs, high cure rate and is known in the city. As the business became busier, his clinic moved four times over the course of 11 years. By around 1928, monthly income was up to thousands of dollars, with equipment such as the most advanced X-ray machines and ultraviolet therapy devices at the time. \\nOn the beach, he was famous, and in 1930 an 18-book book of Shanghai Celebrity Biography was published in a hardcover color copper edition. For this rendering hype, he is very disgusted and disdain. When someone came to ask for a book, he said with a smile, 'Be sure I'm a corrugated pumpkin.' (Press: this is Wu Yen, describe someone who does not know the routine rules of doing things). He self-numbered [right song next to the left man], meaning that he was just an ordinary person, self-taking as a little bug that could make a big voice. \\n'My father has a simple democratic idea that China is too poor and has always been very sympathetic to the poor,' recalled his daughter Peng Zenghan. He often treats poor people who have no money, including those who do not have money come to see a doctor after opening up. He often said that medicine should serve the civilian population, and the idea has always guided him. \\nIn the 50s, Mr. Pang often used a white cloth hand embroidered red pillow, this is a donated by Ms. Haxiumei. As Mr. Pang learned that her husband had sacrificed on the battlefield, the family was financially constrained. Not only did he waive medical fees and greet the relevant pharmacies, the cost of medicine was low, but also carefully healed her persistent illnesses. She personally embroidered this small cushion to Dr. Pang, who saw it as a patient's mind, very valued and often put it on the desk to motivate himself to better serve those who needed him. \\nHe runs a clinic that is not only satisfied with treating patients for a living, so at the beginning of its opening, he did the following two unique things:\\nOne is to set up 'health care'. This means that the individual or the whole family pay a number of medical expenses per year, and the outpatient clinic is no longer charged. Similar to modern rural cooperative medical care, the aim is to reduce the burden on patients, so as to avoid the patient's mistreatment due to the stinting of medical fees, which is particularly beneficial to the long-term disease. In order to achieve 'health care', he specifically hired an internal and surgeon in the clinic to enable the clinic to attend a full day. \\nThe second thing is to add the words 'veins' to the patient as a Western medicine. In addition to symptoms and initial diagnosis, it also includes a profiling of etiology, expected efficacy and possible changes, so that patients know how to self-care and pay attention to changes. This 'pulse case' differs from medical records only for physicians, but is more considered for patients to meet their needs. \\nAlthough for a variety of reasons, the above measures have not been implemented for a long time, but it can be seen from them that he has every intention to innovate, his consciousness of serving civilians is strong, and there is no unpredictable doctor's shelf. \\n'We Chinese should have their own hospitals and medical schools'\\nAlthough opening a clinic is the main business of Mr. Pang Jingzhou, it is not the main line of his life. He spent the most of his life in medical education. It can be said that he has some kind of teacher's talent. His students were very impressed with him, saying that 'his passion for teaching knowledge and students is not common.' Not only that, he also has a deep sentiment, which is: 'We Chinese should have their own hospitals and medical schools.' To that end, in the 1930s, he paid a lot of effort to run schools and hospitals, especially when Tongde Medical School faced an existential crisis, he reversed the situation. \\nIn 1924, after opening, he taught at Tongde Medical College. Soon, there was a factional struggle at the school until the lawsuit was involved. Although one of the victorious parties was the principal, but because of the deep sectarian consciousness among teachers and students and the lack of clarity about property disputes at the school site and the lack of resources to run the school, the principal was unable to do so for a while. The Tongde Medical College is facing a crisis, and it is almost impossible to do so. Under this situation, school founder Huang Shengbai, Shen Yunfei Shang, invited the young Pangjing Zhou to become the provost, giving him the right to act. \\nSo, he took over the 'mess' when he had not yet established a year. Regardless of his seniority, he tried his best to play his unique social activity ability, with a quick knife to cut off the situation, he first borrowed the building located in Aiwenyi Road (now Beijing West Road), Taixing Road, Pinghu Jufu Liu's building for school premises to resume classes, and then quit German teachers who were abusive pole charge respectively, hired several well-known school directors, hired several well-known school managers to stay The Chinese people from Germany and returning from Germany have been taught, and the teaching lineup has greatly improved in a short period of time, and students are honestly conscientious. The factional strife naturally subsided, and the situation quickly stabilized. At that time, the famous physicians who stayed in Tongde for a long time were Obstetrics and Gynecology Specialist Jin Qian, Internal Medicine Specialist Shen Qian, Wang Jingyang, Dermatologist Yu Pengxi, Physiology Specialist Zhou Zongqi and others. Strong teachers ensure the existence and smooth development of Tongde Medical College. \\nAt the end of 1924, Tongde Medical College officially renamed Medical College. Prior to that, Pang jingzhou had rented a plot of land on Tongfu Road (Jinshimen Road), to a new school manager and businessman Huang Chujiu. He took one year to build a new school building and affiliated hospital for Tongfu Medical College. The college professors work together, starting from scratch, making teaching and internship equipment into scale. Since then, he presided over the Tongde School of Medicine for 11 years until in 1935, Dr. Gu Yuqi succeeded as Dean of Tongde Medical School. He has since been retained as a school manager to take over the Tongde Medical College after the founding of the State. \\nHis students in charge of Tongde school were all over the country and overseas, including experts. Today, Shanghai Second Medical University was merged by Palit, Aurora and St. John's three houses before liberation. Many people remember him at the founding meeting of the Second Medical University. His students, many of whom are already highly respected experts, recalled: 'At Tongde, Mr. Pang gave us an anatomy lesson. 'We particularly like his class, he was eloquent and very enthusiastic'; 'He made a deep impression that we could never forget.' The students also recalled how Mr. Pang brought student internships to the wounded hospital to serve the people at that time. In remembering the history of the school, one cannot forget his efforts to rectify his efforts to rectify the fate of Tongde Medical College. \\nInvolve in charity and social activities\\nHis consistent purpose is: the healer, to improve the health of the whole society as a noble duty. Mr. Pang Jing-Zhou has enthusiastically participated in the charitable undertakings of medical care in Shanghai. \\nIn the summer of 1926, Sunan-With cholera rampant, he recalled the situation at that time: 'At that time, the ordinary people were suffering, sick, no money for cure, no help, and died on the road.' This is what he could not bear as a doctor to see. So he co-sponsored an emergency epidemic hospital with famous business and businessman Huang Chujiu. Mr. Huang made his own donation and implementation of the hospital site. He also went to raise funds and prepare a board of directors. Mr. Pang is responsible for recruiting medical staff, preparing equipment, making regulations and conducting consultations in person. The hospital site was first located in Baike Road (this Fengyang Road), Pike intersection, after only a week of preparation to treat patients, saved a lot of people. The establishment of an emergency emergency emergency hospital was more influential at that time, demonstrating his ability to organize emergency. \\nAfter the cholera peak that year, they built a four-storey permanent hospital site in North Tibet Road, which was built a year later. The hospital admits patients of various epidemics during different seasons, with reduced fees or free of charge for poor patients. Its role has not only prevented the spread of cholera in that year, but also helped to prevent long-term health outbreaks for the population. Mr. Pang is also the director of the Epidemic Hospital for ten years. After liberation, this hospital in North Tibet Road was renamed Hongguang Hospital. With limited seniority and ability to rectify the Tongde Medical School and host the Epidemic Hospital in the short term, Pang jingzhou gained the reputation of 'talented' in the medical community. \\nIn 1932, 'one and 28\\ Songhu war sounded, former General Manager of the Declaration Hall Mr. Shi Liangcai, advocated to organize Shanghai all walks of life against enemy back-up, support 19 road army resistance against Japan. This meeting can be called Shanghai's economic figures, public opinion and representatives of various parties in one. History is the president of the 'back-up committee'. He used to meet with Pang jingzhou often in the 'Declaration' on medical treatment, Mr. Suzhi Pang dared to take on the difficult, patriotic discouragement. So, Mr. Pang and Yan Fuqing became medical leaders of the 'back-up' medical community, taking on the heavy responsibility of the field ambulance. \\nThe 19th Route Army fought hard, and the Nanjing government, instead of not supporting it, has restrained it. Therefore, the wounded and wounded in the battle of Songhu were almost entirely dependent on the ambulance teams organized by the 'back-up society' to be transported to the concession and temporary hospitals in the area of Zhenru and Nanxiang for treatment. The medical community has mobilized all kinds of material and financial resources are unprecedented. Field ambulance has become the main work of the back-up committee, in which Mr. Pang coordinated dispatch, dedicated efforts. At the time of the urgent fighting, Mr. Pang personally drove to Zhenru Military Department and presented the donated telescopes with General Cai Tingkai and Tan Qixiu to pay tribute. On the way back the car was hit by stray bullets, dangerous, other hard work, let alone. \\nThe defenseless movement of Route 19 troops against Japan ended with the signing of a humiliating agreement. After the decision, the 'Support Committee' was changed to a permanent organization, referred to as the Shanghai Municipal Local Association, through which Mr. Pang's subsequent social activities were carried out mainly. \\nAfter the battle of Songhu, Mr. Pang Jingzhou pangjingzhou pains, a sense of confusion about state affairs, in his shadow poems can be seen:\\nShaohua lost water flu year, old dream is faint. Home country slightly chaotic, poetry end of the hot bowel. \\nA lifetime of pride shallow, ten years floating famous not special. The earth struggles for a moment, strong numerical evidence frontier. \\nIn addition to participating in major social emergencies, Mr. Pang Jing-Zhou has been actively participating in medical community activities and advocating for public welfare medicine. Mainly in Shanghai Medical Association, All China Federation of Physicians, Chinese Medical Association, and Medical Education Committee in positions and compulsory work. \\nAccording to his old age, there are two of the most significant things in the early activities of the Shanghai Physicians Association:\\nFirst, with Niu Huisheng, Cai Yumen and others to jointly propose to abolish the practice of practising doctors to receive rebates from formula pharmacies, and take the lead on their own. Second, efforts are made to promote the elimination of factional notions. To this end, a medical practitioner has been advised to cancel the words 'German medicine' and 'Japanese medicine' on the licence. To think that putting such words on one another in their own name is tantamount to emphasizing sectarian division, is not conducive to unity and detrimental to national personality. After this 'positive name', many responders have played the role of relatively diluting the factional concept. \\nThe Chinese Medical Association is an academic group in the medical community. In 1923, it held a national conference at Shanghai East Asia Medical College. At that time, Mr. Pang Jingzhou was a young teacher at the East Asian Medical School, where he became an activist, met with representatives from various areas, which was the beginning of his actual activities. The Chinese Medical Association was originally formed by foreign physicians in China assembled early British and American students to follow the statutes of the foreign society. The journal published in its various disciplines emphasizes international exchange and has been in English for a long time. At that time, Yu Yunxiu's main academics should be eclectic and focused on self-creation to improve the dignity of the nation, and to organize the publication of the Chinese magazine in Shanghai. Yu Yunxiu was the editor of his own editor-in-chief. Mr. Pang admired his eloquent, self-recommended as his assistant, the editor, until the resistance was interrupted. \\nDr. Pang jingzhou always treats social issues as his own business, with great attention and enthusiasm for public health issues. In this regard, he has done both things and written. He wrote 'An Aerial View of Medicine in Shanghai for Ten Years', first published in 'Declaration', and published a single book at his own expense in 1932. The paper analyzes the medical and health situation and problems in Shanghai, and criticizes the government's work. \\nLiu Ruiheng, Director of Health of Nanjing, has drawn the attention of the Director of Health of Nanjing, as the book 'Aerial View of Medicine in Shanghai for Ten Years' makes many suggestions and criticisms on the policy measures of the authorities in the field of medicine and health work. Liu Ruiheng visited him and listened to his opinions every time he went to Shanghai. In 1933, Liu Ruiheng recommended Pang jingzhou to the Ministry of Education as a member of the Medical Education Committee. At that time, there were dozens of medical educators from the Medical Education Committee, who had returned from studying abroad, only Pangjing on Monday who had never gone abroad. During the inspection and discussions at the Medical Education Commission, Mr. Pang strongly stressed that China was poor and lagged behind, people were lacking in medicine, and that it was difficult to adapt to the urgent need to train medical personnel by moving to the eight-year American-style two-part medical education system. This has become the focus of debate on the development of two perspectives on medical education. The opponents, ridiculed him in an unknown affair and a narrow vision; and those who agree, regretted that he was higher than learning, so that his speech was light. \\nUnder this double public opinion, he sprouted the idea of going abroad, and wanted to compare the experience accumulated in medical education over a decade with foreign countries, seeking the stone of his mountains and exhibited his ambitions again. At that time, he was granted a mission from the Ministry of Education to Europe and the United States, which took place in autumn 1935. \\nSuiyuan warfare dispatch touches the hearts\\nA trip to Europe and the United States for more than a year, was unable to warm, and the domestic situation was not far from the total resistance war when it returned. Shanghai Local Association has become an opportunity for Mr. Pang to recommit himself to fighting ambulance work. After some time of brewing, his life trajectory was directed to the most pressing Red Cross field ambulance at the time. \\nIn late autumn 1936, Mr. Pang returned soon from Europe and the United States, General Fu Zuoyi in the Bai Ling Temple to fight the Japanese Jie, people made a great boost. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Local Association and China Red Cross Society three groups jointly set up 'Suiyuan to relieve menace labor and ambulance committee', Pang jingzhou as a standing member. From 23 to 26 November, he flew to Suiyuan (present-day Hohhot), LAO Army in his capacity as Deputy Director-General of the General Assembly of the Red Cross. Mr. Pang and Yan Fuqing representative association and various groups donated medical equipment to Fu Zuoyi's troops. When the condolences were flying south, they stayed in Taiyuan, Xi'an and Luoyang. They met with Yan Xishan, Zhang Xueliang and Chiang Kai-shek Sanshuai, in order to represent the enemies of all walks of life in Shanghai, and 'supervise local chapters to speed up ambulance matters'. \\nAlthough there is a Suiyuan Red Cross branch engaged in field ambulance in front, but the lack of medical and medical care needs to be improved as well. In view of this, on December 1, the Red Cross Society sent Pangjing Zhou to Nanjing, 'Declaration' December 2, 1936 with the title of 'Ponzi Departure', reported that he 'with the Central Prevention Department, and the Department of Health, contact pharmaceutical materials, etc.' Hyperlink' http://www.hszyj.net/editor/eweb_editor/ewebeditor.asp?id=content&style=standard&originalfilename=d_originalfilename&save filename=d_savefilename &savepathfilename=d_savepathfilename'\\\\ l '_ftn4\\ [4], and then 'go to Beiping, and the University of High Schools and Peking University Medical College, organized training teams, after the formation, leading the team members, to Datong Suiyuan, engaged in ambulance. ' \\nAfter Mr. Pang went to Beijing, on December 8, the 'Declaration' reported: 'China Red Cross Federation representative Pang Jing came to Ping on Sunday to prepare the Ambulance Committee of the China Red Cross Association Ambulance Committee North China Branch, is now approaching (North), Ping medical celebrities, established within the day.' Because the preparation of the chapter takes time and the fighting is urgent, a 'North China Interim Branch of the Ambulance Committee of the China Red Cross General Society' was set up in early December to accept the General Committee's mandate to handle the 'subsidy for the temporary rescue and epidemic prevention work in North China'. After the establishment of the temporary branch, quickly team up to the front to open a temporary hospital and ambulance for the wounded. By mid-December, 'Red Cross flags are on the front line'. Pang jingzhou, who will be secretary general of the Red Society, also flew to Suiyuan frontline again to command the dispatch and make great efforts. \\nOn December 10, the 'declaration' to 'Pangjing week in front of the message urgently needed materials', specifically mentioned 'yesterday received Dr. Pangjing Zhou by Sui to the cloud, now the place of wind anger, ice and snow channel, cold (clothes), bedding, should be quickly added, to transport vehicles stretcher, also should be rushed, especially drugs such as cotton, Gauze, bandage... syringe, etc.', 'The war is expected to break out, imminent... ... hope all walks of life to donate, or help to purchase money, Balcock day to forward, in response to emergency needs.' Since late November, he went to Suiyuan to inspect and participate in the command and dispatch of field ambulance work; two trips to Beiping to deal with all aspects of matters, the Red Cross North China temporary chapter immediately strengthened the rescue and epidemic prevention work ahead; he traveled to 'field visits, and planned ambulance equipment. 'Level officers for deep discussion', really play a kind of needle leads, undertakings, planning, coordination of all kinds Power to meet the role of the impending war. His dedication and organization to the cause of ambulance can once again be fully utilized. \\nOn December 17, the 'declaration' to 'Pangjing Zhou return from the frontline talk-rescue Sui battle is very detailed' reported: 'China Red Cross Ambulance Committee, Pangjing Zhou's, since the fighting occurred, repeatedly rushed back and forth the ambulance matter, was established by the Ambulance Committee of the China Red Cross Association, North China temporary division. Will, actively implement the work. He returned to Shanghai in the morning for the collection of medical materials. Pangjing Zhou said his conversation 'all the most important, can be used for all circles of reference.' In his conversation, the layout of the wounded hospital, small to 'gloves made with velvet thread is not very durable, it is best made of leather to be good'; prepared in advance is 'gas masks are now by Tsinghua University Dean of Engineering Gu Yuxiu and Chairman Fu, has been customized 10,000'; meticulous into the 'silk cotton vest Should be reformed silk cotton pants, if it can be made of thick leather, size should be large, especially hardy to use'; strict constraints such as 'ambulance Personnel, not trained, can not serve in the front line, shall be uniformly medicalized'; pile pieces, not all. It would not have been possible to provide such tangible and effective guidance if it were not to be completely in depth, with no meticulous effort and every effort to do everything possible. The relief action during the Suiyuan Resistance War not only sparked the high spirit of war ahead of the generals, but also of great significance to 'awakening the people to rise up in the future' resistance war. The oper"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "ation was also a preview of the total resistance of the Chinese Red Cross Society, in which Mr. Peng Jingzhou worked hard and worked well, laying the foundation for his subsequent organization of field ambulance work when the war broke out. \\nIn early 1937, Pang Jingzhou took over as Secretary General of the Red Society. This arrangement is the result of nearly six months of preparation by Director of Health Lau Sui-hang. In the Suiyuan war, Pang jingzhou first went to Suiyuan to Shanghai, Liu Ruiheng also ordered him to go to Suiyuan again at the end of 1936. Liu in wartime personnel layout has long been intended for Mr. Pang Jingzhou, can be described as bamboo in the chest. When the two people stayed north in Beiping, it coincided with the day of the incident in Xi'an, and the incident was resolved peacefully at the time of return. Liu Ruiheng once indicated to Mr. Pang that it should be a long-term plan for the response. Mr. Pang strongly agreed that both people foresee a war between China and Japan inevitably. Liu had planned with Mr. Pang that once the fighting had come up, health care should be placed under the joint agency of the Red Cross, the Military Medical Department and the Department of Health, in order to use the International Red Cross Convention and integrate the ambulance force. This deployment can be summarized as 'wartime triad'. \\nSoon after Pang Jing-Zhou became Secretary-General, in March, Lau asked for his appointment as a short technical officer of the Department of Health. He was assigned two senior assistants to study response measures and train staff. Lau Sui-hang, Director of Military Medicine and Health, and promoted Kim Po Shin as Deputy Director of Health. This is Liu Ruiheng for the wartime 'three-in-one' architecture in personnel aspects of the work carried out in advance. And Mr. Pang, who was condemned by this fall of distress, based on his past experience and relations with all parties in Shanghai, was also quite confident, and immediately devoted himself and wholeheartedly. \\nOn July 7, 1937, the Lugou Bridge Incident broke out. The ambulance work, like the military preparations at the time, was in a situation that could not cope. Ten days after the Lugou Bridge Incident, Chiang Kai-shek issued a statement in Lushan that 'whoever has the duty to keep the earth to resist the war'. On July 17, the 'Declaration' reported that: 'Shanghai General Secretary General Pang Jing Zhou, is suitable to go to the space on the 9th because of the news on the middle of the way, immediately, all along the way, the North China Ambulance Committee at any time, instruct everything'; 'Because of Nanjing electricity, rushed down on the 15th, the Trent Cheng went eastward, yesterday morning. Japan met with the Health and Military Medical Departments to discuss important cases of ambulance business.' Ponzi in the 1937 Red Cross Monthly magazine issued a section of ambulance cause in the war of resistance: 'This war in North China, Beijing-Zhou ran across the Beijing-Hu Lu Mountains, has made several speeches on the ambulance cause, published three or four texts, and broadcast one or two tones, some reports, some discussion Columns. The urgency of the situation has changed many people holding a wait-and-see attitude, so that his work in the areas of talent collection, fundraising, collection, etc., gradually took the initiative and progress faster. \\nImmediately afterwards, the sound of the 'eight and 13' artillery sounded. Under the situation where the masses of the masses reported to the country, the Red Cross Society, with Shanghai as the center, carried out a vigorous field rescue work along the Beijing-Shanghai line. At that time, Mr. Pang, both as a leader in dealing with meetings and commanding an ambulance team, inspect the treatment situation, must often travel between Beijing and Shanghai. In nervous work, his stomach ulcer bleeding, no treatment, can only barely take medicine to relieve pain, daily by eating some apples and cookies at any time to maintain hunger. In his book 'resistance war and ambulance work', about the 'dispatch of ambulance work' has the following description: 'Somewhere there are wounded soldiers on the front line, sometime wounded soldiers, a hospital has a vacant bed, a hospital has a full bed, a road can be passed, a hospital can be discharged, a hospital can be transferred, a hospital can be set up, a hospital can be set up, after the change of situation, a team can be moved somewhere, how a hospital can be restructured, somewhere should be set up a team yard At some point should be distributed somewhere, whoever such, presiding over the matter, should always investigate the design, contact, adjust the arrangement. Ability to adapt randomly, multi-party planning, striving to be calm, cashier free.' This is exactly the picture of his work at that time, and the pressure and the amount of ideas is by no means comparable to the norm of peace! In late August, Liu Ruiheng said that he was instructed by Song Meiling to use the human, material and financial resources of Shanghai to 'set up a hospital for large-scale serious injuries that could break the world record with 5,000 beds' in Nanjing, with a view to preparing conditions for lasting anti-war ambulance. As Secretary General of the General Association, the hospital was organized under the auspices of Mr. Pang Jingzhou, with financial support from the National Government. \\nAfter taking on the task of setting up the wounded soldier hospital, Mr. Pang fully demonstrated his ability to plan and pioneer the situation, in the absence of a conventional situation to achieve the goal, his dedication spirit and work fanaticism exceeded ordinary people. Every night he drove on Beijing-Shanghai Road and dealt with various matters in both places during the day. Finally, in less than 10 days, he mobilized professors Cui Zhiyi, Shao Youshan and other professors and a group of medical surgeons and a group of nursing staff, with a number of X-ray machines and a large number of devices to be called to Nanjing, and then make the necessary additions in Nanjing. Organized 5,000 beds (one said 3,000 beds), in the former Central University, and received the wounded. Mr. Pang is President and Chen Chongshou is Vice President. Capital Hospital is worthy of 'the crown of the wounded hospital', the size and composition of the speed of the world is rare, cannot but be said to be a major event in the early days of the war of resistance, became the information of international propaganda at that time. The Liangyou Illustrated Newspaper has published a large aerial view of the wounded soldier hospital painted with the Red Cross logo on the top of the Auditorium of CUHK. It was created to provide a strong ambulance protection for the fighting along the Shanghai-Ning line. Unfortunately, due to the sharp turn of the fighting, the large hospital was opened for only one month, and the period of effectiveness was very short. This, from the above decisions, inevitably has a good success component, causing mistakes, and prompting people to realize that 'organizing a medical team of mobility' is more relevant to the changing dynamics of war. But Mr. Pang Jingzhou, who was a concrete performer, had an unforgettable performance in this matter, and could be said to have created a miracle in the field ambulance. \\nThe situation in Nanjing is critical. Mr. Pang used to drive from Shanghai to Nanjing, trying to transfer the wounded soldiers. It had been blocked halfway to Ningbo, and abandoned the ship back to Shanghai, and then rushed to Hong Kong and flew to Wuhan. The wounded and ambulance workers evacuated from Nanjing in Jiangxi had first arrived in Wuhan at that time. Soon, Liu Ruiheng, along with Prof. Lin Kesheng and his party also arrived in Wuhan. So Liu Ruiheng, Lin Ke-sheng and Pang Jing jointly reformed the team on Wednesday, set up a new ambulance team. Lin Ke is the captain of the team. During this period, ICRC supervisors have moved to Hong Kong to discuss the organization of the Red Cross General Association office in Hong Kong in order to receive overseas Chinese and international assistance for domestic demand. Mr. Pang left Wuhan in late 1937 and flew to Hong Kong, where he is still the Secretary-General to preside over the day-to-day business. The ICRC offices and the ambulance brigade were separated from inside and outside, while Mr. Pang left the actual ambulance and handled the ICRC office in Hong Kong until 1939. \\nIn the summer of 1939, the Red Cross received nominations from the Javanese Chinese to donate a large number of medicines and food items from the Eighth Route Army. Mr. Pang Jingzhou was entrusted with the delivery of the goods to Wuhan by Hong Kong, and together with Lin Kesheng on behalf of the Red Cross, formed a convoy to Yan'an. Chairman Mao met with them and made talks about the situation of the war of resistance and a lasting victory. \\nAbout this meeting, Pang jingzhou's daughter recalled, 'My father told me about his visit to Yan'an. He said that Chairman Mao met them in the cave. The main meaning of the conversation was to express gratitude for sending medicine to Yan'an and talked about the situation of resistance at that time. My father clearly remembered that Chairman Mao called Chiang Kai-shek as' Mr. Jiang '. He was very kind and called him 'Mr. Pang'. Chairman Mao pointed to the precarious environment around him, saying, 'Mr. Jiang is too unfair to us. You see, the conditions are poor and there is a lack of physical medicine, and I hope you can appeal and give us a little more help. Also come up with the smoke: 'This is a good smoke from people, please Mr. Pang smoke. '' \\nThey also met in Yan'an with Fu Lianli and Dr. Bethune, who arrived in Yan'an, to learn about the situation of the Eighth Route Army's ambulance work. Since there was no fixed amount of foreign goods and donations raised by the Red Cross Hong Kong office, it was extremely difficult for the office to reconcile supply and demand. Pangjing Zhou deeply tired around, no real work at all, but germination retreat. \\nChongqing air raid ambulance home lost\\nSince October 1938, Japan launched indiscriminate bombardment on Chongqing, the then accompanying capital, and the relief committee chaired by Xu Shiying proposed to organize an air strike ambulance. He understood Mr. Pang's situation and invited him to Chongqing to organize an air strike ambulance committee. Mr. Pang gave up the calm environment in Hong Kong, resigned from the Red Cross and went to Chongqing lightly. \\nFrom winter 1939 to the next spring, he presided over the air raid ambulance committee using Chongqing's fog season voids to attract personnel and form a parade to make Chongqing's airstrike ambulance organizations coarse size. \\nDuring his tenure as the chairman, Chongqing was subjected to the most severe bombing, alerting several times a day. In addition to organizing the civilian population to enter the shelter, the air strike ambulance committee will also go to the bombing site to take stock of the casualties, rescue the wounded and bury the remains. In some cases, the rehabilitation of the previous bombing has not been completed, and the next one is approaching. He always risked his first line of command, despite frequent gastric bleeding at the time, to work with a sick person. During that period, he was not at risk for his family. Even the eldest daughter has no time to participate in marriage, please someone else's main marriage. The granddaughter had a high fever and was in serious condition. He rushed to the work gap, gave some medical guidance, and went to the ambulance scene. He lived with his eldest daughter in Chongqing. This was only the only visit, and he always felt very sorry to mention it afterwards. What made him feel more guilty and sad was that his wife was pregnant at that time, a son, had been four months old, and he decided to take a fetch for fear of affecting the airstrikes. At that time, Chongqing could not find a professional hospital. He was only able to hit the tire by abdominal surgery in a shabby thatched cabin that served as a temporary ambulance operating room, putting his wife's life at great risk. He was not an indifferent person; on the contrary, he was deeply sentimental, but he was decisive and resolute in a career that affected the lives of many people. \\nAfter one and a half years after Mr. Pang Jingzhou undertook the air raid rescue work in Chongqing, he received a new call to join the health cause of the Yunnan and Myanmar railway with his expertise-tropical disease prevention and control. \\nDeep into West Ki, Miasma\\nIn the winter solstice of 1938 in the spring of 1942, the long-planned Burmese railway was finally officially built. Zeng Yangfu, Secretary of State of the Ministry of Transport, is also the supervisor of the Ministry of Transport. Since the remote areas through the railways are malaria-endemic areas, infectious diseases have been ravaged for hundreds of years. In order to ensure the progress of the project, Zeng Youfu almost threw out the country's tropical experts at that time. He learned from Pang jingzhou's classmate Zhu Jiahua that he was good at treating tropical diseases and was good at pioneering the situation. He asked him and Ye Yuanyue, a tropical disease expert from Xiangya Medical College, who had received a medical doctor in Connecticut, United States, to serve as the deputy director of the health department. \\nFrom September to the beginning of the year, Pangjing came to office on Monday to start his work. He has recruited more than 300 medical personnel from around Shanghai and beyond, with more than 70 medical units in size, deep into the area of Miasma in Yunnan, to carry out medical and preventive work for 300,000 migrant workers and engineers along the line. They are a group of desperate and humanitarian-inspired white fighters who have a duty to cure and save people, in total disregard for their possible infection and risk their lives. Their work has not only improved the level of treatment of local medical personnel and their medical ethics, but also developed a set of medical treatment and medication measures that have had a profound impact on the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases in the region. Pang jingzhou is not only responsible for administrative tasks, personally treating disease and epidemic prevention, but also organizes training for young doctors. On the Burmese Railway, he enjoys the support of his staff. He was concerned about the lives of staff members but was extremely harsh when they were not satisfied with their work. The staff members felt very much about him. Some of them worked as ministerial cadres in Beijing after liberation. They always come to Shanghai to see him, even after he was beaten into the right. They believe that 'Director Pang really loves us.' \\nAfter unimaginable hardships, the railway took only two years to lay the track. In December of that year, Pearl Harbor events took place, the war situation turned straight down. The Burmese Railway was forced to stop work in the spring and summer of 1943, and people blew up bridges built with blood and sweat. And all the people involved in the construction of the project turned into those who had no overnight food at home and needed to be accommodated. \\nAt this time, the Central and Burmese Railway Agency was changed to the Military Commission Engineering Committee. Although the health department also nominally changed its affiliation relationship, called the health group, in fact, only a few personnel were actually kept to set up a hospital on the shores of Kunming, so as to deal with the end of the matter. For almost a year. \\nDuring the year, he was responsible for the resettlement and demobilization of personnel. Construction was a 'top priority', with adequate funding and smooth operation. After the project was considered cumbersome, funding was stretched and difficult to do so. He knows that these staff members have suffered hard for the health cause of the Yunnan and Myanmar railway. If you kick off, will they not be too cruel? So he did his best to take responsibility for everyone, not only to arrange a way out of life, but also to find ways to introduce them to work until they were properly settled. Between the autumn and winter of 1944, Guiyang hurried, Mr. Pang drove from Kunming through Guizhou to Chongqing, almost three months on the way. Arriving in Chongqing in early 1945, it was only more than half a year away from the victory of the resistance. \\n'He is full of love for young people!' \\nMr. Peng Jingzhou left Chongqing to return to Shanghai in July 1945. \\nIn the war of resistance, he experienced the most difficult situation, and after not thinking of victory, politics remains unclear. He witnessed a lot of triumphant fortune races, angry in his heart, as he saw and heard, wrote a 'Shanghai January Chronicle' sent to his relatives and friends, in order to depressed his chest. This article was obtained by Chongqing's Xinhua Daily and published inquietly. Hong Lanyou once said to him: 'Brother is rare and strange, self-named straight, really naive, how can he be an official?' A little bit breaking his personality characteristics. After seeing corruption in the official arena a day, Mr. Pang knew himself to catch up with the turbulence, it would be better to earn a living with skills and be alone. \\nIn addition to the opening of the second time, he also took part in running the University and running training courses. Both schools were directed at the problem of a vulnerable part of society, and he had deep sympathy for the fate of that part of the population. \\nAfter the end of the war of resistance, during the fall of Shanghai, the German medical school in Tongji and the medical school run by the government of Wang Jingwei were regarded as 'pseudo-' characters. The students of these two schools lost half the way and did not receive their diploma and faced unemployment. The integration of 'pseudo-' school students is a temporary task, no spiritual ordinary people are unwilling to take over; but without experience and appeal, they are unable to hire professors and cannot take up this task. Mr. Pang felt that the students were unfit and unfair. From 1945 to 1946, he was appointed as a temporary university medical director, with the task of receiving students from the second school and above, organizing the resumption of classes and transferring them to the prescribed institutions after examination. With his original social ties, he hired many well-known professors, many of whom were his classmates, who read lectures on his face. As his daughter said, 'He is full of love for young people! Some of the students were working hard, and he appreciated it. He had a great relationship with students.' By the second year of summer vacation, the students will have their own place, and the Promenade is over. Later, this group of students often came to visit him in hordes. Many people disciples very respectfully, unchanged for decades. Many of them were able to learn more than a year, and were deeply indebted to Mr. Pang, who said that at their most hopeless time, Mr. Pang spent a lot of energy for their future. \\nShortly after the adjournment in 1946, Mr. Pang ran a training course for doctors who practised without a license in Shanghai. At that time he found a problem, he said, 'There are many quacks in Shanghai. A clinic in the downtown area opened and advertised everywhere. They're a bit of medical knowledge, but they're not very complete, very wrong. After all, it's not scientific, unhygienic, without professional training, all half the way out of home!' Those doctors are often banned without a licence, without a guarantee of survival. So this training course is good for both patients and for this group of people. He took advantage of his superior relationships, ran the Health Bureau, the Social Bureau, stamped, and kept running. He borrowed classes at Gezhi Middle School and spent an amateur class at night. The teachers invited were medical celebrities in Shanghai. He also bought teaching supplies in person, prepared his own teaching plan, all according to regular schools. Students learn the basics of medicine and carry out basic training. Many of the students in this class have reached the middle age, re-study, very useful. After passing the screening examination by the Health Bureau, they were qualified to practise the medical profession. The course concluded in 1947 and all those who were licensed to practise medicine praise Mr. Pang Jingzhou. As his daughter said, 'I think he is very visionary, often with a unique vision, finding some social problems, and acting to solve problems.' \\n'I have a share of nation-building, stand up my chest and live a few years'\\nIn 1948, Mr. Pang ceased his clinic business due to retinal stripping. But he still has medical lectures on radio stations. His lectures face the masses, combining everyday habits, deep out, popularizing knowledge of medicine and hygiene, and answering questions for the audience. Due to his knowledgeable, agile thinking, and lively language, answering listener questions like chatting with friends, he was well received by the audience. At that time, it became a 'ringing' radio programme on the beach, almost household known to women and children. So far, some old gentlemen and ladies over 80 years old raised the matter, and also claimed to be a loyal listener of Dr. Pang that year. He insisted that the radio reform was not terminated until 1950. \\nFrom 1955 to 1956, Chen Yi held an intellectuals conference in Shanghai. His daughter recalled: 'My father was excited to come back at the meeting. 'The Communist Party respects intellectuals and intellectuals, and I must respond to the call to contribute to the country,' he said. At that time, he could earn 800 to 1,000 yuan per month. If he went to the national hospital, he could only earn 300 yuan, and only 200 yuan to the primary clinic. He was eager to serve the country. After waiting for the position of director of a major hospital in Hangzhou, he was anxious to work at the Luwan District Clinic in Shanghai. It started three and a half days a week, but he had to work all day. The other person thinks his doctor is too big to use. However, because he did not participate in social activities for many years after liberation, he was anxious to join society. At that time, he worked for the country one by one, saying, regardless of the size of the unit, as long as he could serve the people. \\nSo, Mr. Pang gave up his practice of practising medicine and went to the clinic throughout the day. Regrettably, shortly after the anti-right movement unfolded, he usually had nothing to stop, in this small grass-roots unit, which was not easy to get enough right quotas, he was beaten as the right. The charges are 'anti-Soviet', 'Li Tong foreign', 'opposition to industrial and agricultural cadres', 'committing 'insiders against layers' mistakes' and so on. Forced to sweep the ground, watch the door, do punitive labor. His physical and emotional hardships were hard hit, and what was most painful was not the recuperation of social status and labor, but the lack of access to medical services. \\nThe outpatient department then arranged him to the health section and was responsible for spreading health knowledge at the grass-roots level, and he felt that he had another place to use and work very attentively. He has a great enthusiasm for the popularization of medicine and health education. Even if he is beaten as the right, even if he is sick, he has personally prepared many commonly applicable teaching materials and lectures very seriously to the health staff. As a medical doctor, he speaks about the most basic knowledge, but he is meticulous and highly valued, and has forged forget-years with a general health practitioner, and his friendship continues until his death. \\nOut of a fraternity heart, after liberation he worked outside his job, has always been responsive to all kinds of training within and outside the unit; in terms of participation in the cause of public welfare, it is even more reasonable and consistent. \\nIn 1961, he turned to study medical history because of overwork and inability to work. As early as the 50s, he went to Beijing to attend the annual meeting of the Chinese Medical Association, served as Secretary General of Shanghai Medical History Society, accompanied by President Tang Yuanji to organize conference activities. He has written 'History of Malaria in China' and 'History of Tuberculosis' and so on. By the time of his death, a number of notes and drafts on infectious diseases and the combination of Chinese and Western medicine were left behind. Unfortunately, they were not available in writing. \\nIn his poem to his daughter, he wrote: 'Slightly rickets on both shoulders, nose lines and eyelids increase. I have a share of nation-building, stand up my chest and live for a few years. The words 'I have a share' and 'get up the chest', especially show his character character. \\nMr. Pang Jingzhou has a wide range of contacts, friends all over home and abroad. First of all, as a medical practitioner, he is both progressing, and participating in various community activities, easy to know, and to know others; both he pioneered and run more, working up and down and various collaborators are very wide; three years before and after the door wall, the friendship between teachers and students is enduring. But the main reason is that his knowledge and interests are particularly broad, laughing and everywhere, so many people are willing to meet him. \\nIn the summer of 1965, a year before the death of Mr. Pang Jingzhou, he had come to Beijing's children and daughters to stay in Beijing. At that time, he had been very decayed, gasped, struggling. He was diagnosed with lung cancer, but he had been treated for pulmonary heart disease because he could not diagnose it. He knew that soon the world, sent letters to all his friends to come to the house. The friends are Zhang Xiaoqian, Shen Qian, Zhou Lun, Long Bojian, Ye Shengtao, Gu Jie Gang, Zhu Xuefan, Wang Boxiang, Xun Huisheng and others. Mr. Zhang Shizhao came twice to talk with Mr. Pang in bed for a long time. One day, Mr. Pang also special Mr. Zhang Shizhao and the other three or five old in the apartment for light meals. He personally cooked to cook for all people, knowing that Mr. Zhang Shizhao of Pang Jing Zhou gave him a short sentence:\\nTracked horse cattle wind, for 60 years. \\nBut there is a person who knows, like a stork like a dragon...\\nToday, there is still a shadow, talk about it even more. \\nFrom this poem you can see Mr. Pang's wide interplay and troubled old age. Mr. Pang's body is slender and wasting, 'shaped like a stork like a dragon', was praised by all of you here for the magic pen and recite each other. \\nWhen Mr. Pang died because of the Cultural Revolution, five other children and daughters did not go to the souvenir, nor went to bereft. Only his wife and her little daughter and son-in-law who lived in Shanghai sent him farewell. His old age has always told the little girl, and after his death, his remains must be donated to the cause of medical anatomy. Because he taught anatomy classes for a long time, he knew how rare it was to teach the remains. However, because of the chaos caused by the Cultural Revolution, no one had been asked at that time. At the last moment, he also commanded the little girl: 'Go to the Second Medical University to look for Guo Jingyan, and donate my body to the Second Medical University.' Sadly, the soul of the medical! After life and death, everything belongs to the medical cause. \\nAfter his death, he learned that he died of lung cancer and was unable to check out because the large arteries covered the tumor. \\nDr. Pang jingzhou according to his own philosophy of life, doing more human things, finished his pursuit of 'concentrated life'. This life, enriched by charity and fraternity, is the life of the Red Cross humanism! (30 June 2007)"}

My name is Pan zhengyan Zhengyan. If you ask Zhu Zhenhuan and Dong Yingjia, they certainly remember me, especially Zhu Zhenhuan, we have a very good relationship. Dong Yingjia also slept with me on a shop. \\nWhat I can remember in the tomb study is Chen Hongsheng (he is also my secondary school alumni, about rural origin, good health, we call him a great two, is our deputy leader), Guo Daohong, Zhang Xingtao (Xintao, he is indeed a crooked neck, Haimen man), Wu Zhi (Zhi), Jun Guizhou Province, once participated in the anti-US aid North Korea. According to him, he told me that he was a clerk, stationed. At the Yalu River), Yuan Meikung, Kim Dae-yong (I and I were together at the Hanbobashi Detention Center. According to his own account, he graduated from Waseda University, and later moved to 585 points due to his old age and infirmity, and once I stumbled that he was a propaganda in the squadron), Zhang Shao Hung (I had little contact with him. I remember that he was in a suit leather crawler at the Half Step Bridge Detention Unit. (Personality, later changed to wear a fat and large light blue labor uniform). Bow Qingyuan I also remember, waist board wide, thick arms, talking laughter. Actually, the first one who died at the Qinghe Farm Third Session was left out of the list. His name was Xu Danyan, a Shanghai-city man, perhaps a ningbo. It seemed to be an interpreter. We just arrived at the Qinghe Farm in West Wasteland 584, he loved one, a small and beautiful Shanghai man, specifically came to see him, and was the first family to visit the prison. Around 1958, he was in the bushes. I also want to ask about this. In the article, he said that with Zhang Xintao, there is a Tsinghua University student Liu Xuefeng. I want to know whether it is Liu Xuefeng or Liu Xuepeng? Liu Xuepeng is a third-year student in the Architecture Department of Tsinghua University. I have been with him since I went to Qinghe Farm until 1960, to give the right wing of Xingkai Lake, they went to Jialing, and I stayed in three places, (and Zhu Zhenhuan, until 1968 I was sent back to me. I never heard from Liu Xuepeng again. I hope he is still alive now. And Yang Xiaoping, he wasn't because of his infirmity. He was a mechanical student at Tsinghua University. He invented a seedling-pulling machine, so he left him in three points. Also, Mr. Huang Jizhong, he was very good to me, and I often asked him questions about English. He introduced me to read what he had translated 'Big Brother Bere McKay', 'Olas,' and reread his translation of Tom Big Beard's Cabin. He has a daughter named Huang Mai and a son named Huang Gang, and I am familiar with it. \\nI also saw photos of Han Dajun and Yang Lu with a group of me in Cong Weixi's novel 'Towards Chaos', as well as Zhang Zuanzu, the son of Zhang Ziping, working at Xinhua News Agency, who was missing from the death list. \\nAfter the rest, was rehired by several units, but for health reasons, recently resting at home, since I read 'Tomb Research', I am 'Two Eyes Dragon and Tears', nitroglycerin tablets also contain a lot of mouth, I don't know how much time I have, but I hope someone can understand us at that time 20 Many years old, the suffering suffered. We live now, it is very lucky, I did not ask for him, but very much wanted to communicate with people who were suffering at that time, especially Brother Zhu Zhenhuan, please be sure to tell me his email address.

In terms of 'killing', it was not a good thing, but in order to overthrow In terms of dark rule, building a socialist society in China, then the killing of the Communist Party is not only right but must be killed, although many innocent working people who were pulled by the Kuomintang as cannon fodder have also been killed, this is also the case. \\nThe following on the whole wind felt by little bit, another broken problem to express some thoughts:\\n1. This time the whole wind was proposed by the Party Central Committee, so the whole country came up and down a big magnification, was there no contradiction before? No comments? That is not true, only because the Party Central Committee has not raised it yet, so dare not dare to 'put' on some issues. The so-called 'dare not' is that there is an invisible 'taboo'. Now the ban has been opened, and there is a variety of controversy everywhere. Whether on the 'Ming' 'put' a bit, a hurry for everything? No. The serious question is: how to solve a series of fundamental problems correctly and in a timely manner, it depends on the following, well done below, everyone in the 'long neck prospect'. \\n2. I have the view that the Communist Party is a political party, which is based on its political platform and its practical actions to gain the trust of the people, because the ideas and actions of the Communist Party of China are conducive to the livelihood of the State, so we all embrace it to lead the country's work. It is not surprising, however, that there are inevitably some views on the treatment of certain places and issues. But some comrades have sanctified the Communist Party, creating a culture of idol worship, which is still quite strong. Some people, for example, believe that party members and even senior party members lead comrades are flawed, but the party is absolutely right and there will be no drawbacks. But I doubt: what about the Yugoslav problem, that of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia as a whole? Or is it just 'Tito' a man's problem? What about the Hungarian event, is the party problem? Or a leader's personal question? Why can only give opinions to party members and not to the Communist Party? Many of the issues that are reflected now are issues with national, universal and fundamental nature are not party problems? I think that the truth is relative, there is no absolute truth, and there is only a moment, somewhere, and the right way to deal with something, to obtain temporary absolute truth, which is no exception to political parties. Nor is Marxist Leninism a constant, universal truth for millennia. \\n3. I believe that China's political system is now a one-party dictatorship of the Communist Party, and the People's Congress is only a formal organ. Looking at the discussion of issues at several times in the National Congress, there are unanimous agreement on the proposal proposed by the Party Central Committee. At best, it is a minor revision of the text and sentence, with differences of a fundamental nature. Sexual opinion, I haven't seen, is not no problem I see Nor is it, many of the opinions put forward by people from all walks of life this time are of fundamental nature. I think the current electoral system is also problematic. What else, I don't know, as far as our constituencies are concerned, electing people's deputies is undemocratic, completely arranged instead. When deputies, seven deputies should be elected, and seven people will be appointed by certain organs and groups, and ask our citizens to draw Circle, I am very sorry, and I have no knowledge of each other about the representatives of the people who represent us. I voted for a vote to represent my will. It is very skeptical. It is said that if you do not agree, you can vote all others, which seems to be very democratic, in fact, just say it, do not believe it? You try it. Better yet, some people have made comments, and the party newspaper replied: 'This is the most democratic election method'. You are not satisfied with it, then give up your rights, nor will it work, 'people are afraid of their words'. What if they therefore suspect that they are a counter-revolutionary? So every time an election, I had to endure the mood of 'democracy being damaged', drawing a few circles. It cannot be blamed that in the days of election of people's deputies, people's mood is not rejoicing and encouraging, and it is an artificial illusion to beat the drum outside. \\n4. Some people say that you seem to be asking for bourgeois democracy. I also do not admit that I am a champion of communism. I participated in the revolution because I felt that the Kuomintang is abominable and the Communist Party is good. I call for this way to realize communism, that is: kill as little as possible and fight as narrowly as possible, to carry out revolution and construction from the interests and demands of the greatest majority of people, and require full freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, demonstration, as long as it is not counter-revolutionary. Be highly respectful of human personality and will. Fully democratic politically, economically prosperous and culturally increasing. The Communist Party of China is in line with my wishes, so I support it, but it is not equal to lack of opinion. For example, the 'three anti-counter' and 'rebellious' 'rebellion' to keep people locked up, it is a violation of the Constitution. The publication of newspapers, newspapers and books is entirely controlled by the Communist Party, and the freedom of speech and publication has been restricted. It has not seen an article or a statement of dissent since the founding of the country, and the fact that the life of organs is generally less democratic and sometimes felt. Some of the recent freedom of expression, but it is only the beginning, hoping that it will be maintained and carried out even more. \\n5. The intra-people contradictions are multifaceted, but the most fundamental contradictions are material. Our economic life today is much different and improved considerably than in the past. But it is also undeniable that there are also more and more problems. The basic reason is that material production does not meet the growing needs of the people. It is indeed a difficult question, but is there no mistake in handling the problem? I think there is no, is there any difficulty that can't be solved? I think that's not all. As a result of dogmatic and bureaucratic handling of the national economy, some difficulties have been artificially created. For example, in the second half of 1995, the country introduced a capital saving programme, which has the advantage of saving some investment, but also disadvantages, and, on the contrary, a lot of human, material and time are wasted. As in the development of the national economy in 1956, the pace of the development of the national economy was a little larger, there was no balance in all aspects, and a lot of materials were wasted, causing a lot of losses. Some large-scale projects were not moving on, and had to go down, and caused some waste. There is waste, then it is not possible to do things that might be done. This has caused tension in 1957 and increased internal contradictions among the people. So I think: the question of the proportion of heavy and heavy industries, the rate of growth of agricultural production, the proportion of consumption and accumulation can be studied again and again. If you can make appropriate adjustments in these areas, even a small project, a small proportion, the internal contradictions of the people can be solved quite a lot. \\n6. This year is one of the internal contradictions of the population in terms of education, with many school-age children unable to attend primary school, many primary school graduates cannot go to secondary school, and many secondary school graduates cannot go to university. According to propaganda in the press, saying this is a normal phenomenon, I also do not completely deny that it is a normal phenomenon. The so-called 'normal' is compared with the historical situation, but it is not a good phenomenon for small children to attend primary school. Some farmers say, 'Now they emphasize literacy, older, this can not be literate. It is reasonable to want my child not to be illiterate in the new society'. Besides, universal primary school is also the basic construction of a country. It will take more than a decade after the good and bad consequences to bear fruit. In more than a decade later, China can build socialism. By that time, a large number of young people are illiterate, which is detrimental to the livelihood of the nation's citizens, or now let children become illiterate, and it will become bigger in the future. Literacy, I see it is not doing well. My opinion is that all school-age children should be enrolled in school as far as possible, and those who cannot attend school must also let them read literacy. Even if the state is asked to give some more money to run primary school, that is to dig a little out of heavy industry investment, not to mention that there are many unreasonable investment arrangements now. Not to mention anything else, take a look at the new large opera house in Wuhan City, invest 1.5 million yuan, not to build a bank, I see it. By running primary schools, tens of thousands of primary school children can be financed for one year's education. \\n7. Recently, I do not think that I want to oppose birth control and contraception, from top to bottom, but not to say that I want to oppose birth control and contraception, but rather do not need such a vigorous propaganda, which is necessary for some people, but if it is motivated by the country's population policy, it would be quite doubtful. The country has always been proud of 'many people, rich in assets', remember Chairman Mao Being proud of this, not now, there seems to be a 'human affliction' disaster. Economically speaking, China's national income can grow by about 6-8 per cent per year, while natural population growth averaged about 2 per cent per year. The economic life of the existing population has grown less, saving a little to the new population. Why not? If there are more people in a country like ours to engage in socialism, then Japan and Belgium cannot engage in socialism. In addition to the fact that the child grew up a labor force and increased wealth, I see the problem still lies in the arrangement of economic construction, the opening up of new cultivated land and the speed of agricultural mechanization is worth studying. If it is not possible to mechanize agriculture in a decade later, I think this socialism is not doing much. If agricultural mechanization can be achieved after 10 years and the electrification of agriculture in 20 years, then the population problem will not be a problem. Within that decade, we have experienced little economic growth, industrialization has been made possible, and contraceptive contraception is not addressed as a national policy. Historically speaking, the national economy has grown faster than the rate of population growth. Otherwise, when communism will come, it will happen that people will suffer, and 'demographic revolution.' \\n8. Material dialectic law is the magic of the revolution, but also the magic of bureaucracy, because the dialectical law is used well is the dialectic law, improper use is the most ingenious sophie, can confuse a group of people, and bureaucrats often use dialectical law to cover for themselves, speaking always his Reasonable, examples are everywhere, such as arrangements for career development in 1956 , obviously risked some, caused a lot of losses, but bias said: 'Big development is certainly good, the shortcomings in development are inevitable, the cost of the loss is small, and the experience is rich, so it is a cheap matter.' Is it not costly to lose? In 1956, more than two billion more were used, I see no small. If the billions were to be used less in 1956 and put it in 1957, you can do a lot of things, and the pace of development is normal, and the internal contradictions of the people can be increased relatively less. Moreover, it is clear that this person is a bragging speculator, but prefers to say that the opportunity for the revolution is still good. It is clear that this party member is not enough to talk about it in all aspects, but prefers to say that it is to train cadres. It is clear that this thing should not be done, it is wrong to do it, but to say that it is not only right but necessary in some way. Clearly there are problems in certain things, but bias say that from the historical perspective, it is much better now than in the past, so it is normal, and so on. \\n9. in feudal society, all kinds of products, only reading high, so, cold windows ten years, hard for name, is a good atmosphere of society at that time. There is a tasting In capitalist society, all things are available, only money is good. Therefore, speculation, hurts the situation, as long as wealth becomes rich, is a kind of culture in society at that time. There are plate eyes. What about now? All people come under, only party members are high, party members are promoted before, whether he is competent or not competent, party members can exchange love, so one of the conditions for many lesbians is to party members. The fact that party members can be given priority in their lives, and so on. Therefore, a culture has also been formed. Enlisting the party is a necessary means for some people to achieve the above objectives. Therefore, it is extremely careful to temporarily suppress these unseen personal attempts, openings for progress, closed politics, and use all the time, especially using various movements, 120,000 are very active, and add a little more Blow blow shoot, loaded out a progressive look, so it actually went into the party, and once joined the party, it slowly revealed The tail came. This is not individual, but universal (of course not to say that every party member is the same), so in fact it is formed a style, but better after the discovery of the fox tail, there is also its cover, that is: people are from old society, the residual effects are inevitable, the party did not ask All comrades in the party are proficient in Marxinism. Finally, there is a magic weapon: everyone has its advantages and disadvantages, as a person cannot be without mistakes, and Communist Party members are no exception. This is what Chairman Mao said, so the world is peaceful. \\n10. The last point of hope: this rectification movement was banned by the Party Central Committee, so I dare to voice it, but I do not want to just comrades 'ringing' and let the leaders 'listen', as the director of Ren said: 'Everyone put the opinion 'down', 'down' until the end.' In the future, the basic issue of 'change' will remain unchanged on the branch issue. Even the material is placed in the file and the photograph is kept. May later what sports, can be used to 'the Spear of the Lord, the shield of the Lord'. Indeed, some comrades believe that 'Ming' is 'harmful and unhelpful.' 1957.6.3 [A Selection of Rightist Speech (Continuation)' Propaganda Department of Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Hubei People's Publishing House, 1958)\\nII. Issues concerning equality of people in storage and security\\nA recent period of newspapers, a wide variety of statements, was a fierce class struggle on the ideological front. Many people are angry at the anti-socialist rhetoric of Ge Pei Qi and Chuan An equality. I don't think it is necessary. The problem is rebuttal. With regard to the remarks of Ge, Chu and others, I said very well. Their remarks are credited to the Party, the people and the benefit of socialism. They should be thankful. Their 'credit' is greater than Fu Zuoyi, Chen Mingren and others. If they can accept criticism and turn over, they should be valued. Initially, to engage in the socialist revolution, everyone supports, and there is no group of people to oppose it, that is the naive idea. They are always better than not to talk about their own ideas, not to mention that these ideological emotions are still representative. The party can educate the masses, especially intellectuals and people of small bourgeoisie origin. Without them, the line between socialism and anti-socialism will not be raised, and it is not yet clear that there are still right-wing elements. Well, it will not be so clear in the minds of many people. I was the one, at the beginning, I saw the remarks of Zhu Anping, and did not see any problem, on the contrary how much resonated. After a look, he said that his speech was anti-party, anti-socialist, reactionary, and reactionary speech. This only felt that his level of thought was very poor. \\nI am therefore reminded of the issue of freedom of expression, which I thought in the past should be fully developed, but there should be a line that would only benefit socialist freedom of expression and no anti-socialist freedom of expression. Now I think that there is no need to limit this, just say what you want to say. Socialist speech is certainly good, anti-socialist rhetoric can also be aroused. This can cause controversy, and you can educate people from the debate. Since Marxinism is not a wall grass, then why should I fear attacks. Do not believe in the power of the Party and the people. Non-socialist and anti-socialist ideas exist objectively, especially during the transitional period, without which it would be strange. It is not easy to resolve ideological problems by administrative orders and repression. It can be resolved only by means of controversy and persuade. In the course of debate and persuasion, if the dogmatic approach is also ineffective, it must be argued by the facts. \\n** *\\nThe culmination of the 'private reform' last year, and the publicity in the press is how the bourgeois embrace socialism. It is a fact that some people of the Chinese national bourgeoisies have been educated in history, their minds have changed, abandoned the interests of their current class and supported socialism wholeheartedly. But there is no one objection, I am very strange. Such propaganda is against Marxism. My view is that some people are socialist, some people are out of last resort, and some people are opposed, but they don't dare to say. Now, many capitalists have spoken, reflecting their dissatisfaction with socialism, and some suggest ways to revive capitalism, some even delusional parties will accept their approach, and so on. These demands and emotions are real. These statements are also anti-socialist. But there was no way to be rebutted like Ge Pei Qi and Chuan An equality people. Although Li Kangnian and others have also suffered some rebuttal, the extent of which is far worse than Ge and Chu. Reason: Is it because: Ge, store and others are not bourgeois in themselves, but their remarks represent the interests of the bourgeois. In terms of their position, it is easy to blur a group of people, and to the detriment of capitalists speaking on behalf of his class's interests, it is not surprising that people are very easy to speak on behalf of his class. Look clearly. \\n** *\\nBefore 'liberation', Zhu Anping was the editor of the 'observation' magazine (that is now the predecessor of the new observation), Zhang Naiji is one of the famous 'patriotic seven gentlemen', before the 'liberation' are well-known progressive people, they are championing the Communist Party, but after liberation, it has been more than eight years after liberation, the state built So fast development, and their minds are moving slowly or even changing It was not surprising that it became anti-socialist, anti-Marxinist ideology. With Fu Zuoyi, Chen Mingren and others, before liberation, they used to kill many people for the Kuomintang, but after surrendering, it really 'put down the slaughter and stand up into a Buddha'. Progress is faster than the store, Zhang and other people seem to be faster. In my heart, there are indeed some pity for them, some uneven. This truth, I had not figured out for quite a long time. Remember the October revolution of the Soviet Union, there were such people who had championed socialism before the revolution, but after the revolution, socialism really came, and they were shaken and even opposed to socialism. Why? Although the Soviet Union at the beginning of the revolution was successful, there was a period of turmoil, extremely difficult, coupled with a 'left' rebellion, which left these people away from socialism and even against socialism. But there is a basic reason that they always stand on individualistic positions, short vision, lack of vision, and bourgeois thinking and views, so their views and demands on things are different. Storage, chapter and other people have this similar. \\n** *\\nI don't think that the two people have common ground in recent newspapers 'denouncing Ge Pei Qi and Chu Anping's anti-communist remarks', 'refuting the anti-socialist fallacy of Ge Pei Qi and Chu Anping.' I don't think that the two people have their common denominator, that is, anti-socialism and opposition to the Communist Party leadership. But there are also some differences. My opinion is: Ge's remarks are full of counter-revolutionary speech, distorted, slandered, vicious, and a bit like the KMT's reactionary landlords. However, Chu's speech is the leader of the opposition party and demands bourgeois democracy. If this is the case, then it should also be treated differently. Perhaps some people want to say, since Chuanping is the leader of the opposition party and demands bourgeois democracy, is it not anti-socialist or counter-revolutionary? I think that there is a right place to think that, but it's not entirely true. If you look at the problem in a dogmatic and mechanical way, it is not difficult to draw the above conclusions. However, the minds of people are very complex. Human minds are not all developed according to the Marxinist formula. Especially in the transitional period, it is more complex. Some people are 100 percent proletarian thought, some people are outright bourgeoisie thought, and others have both proletarian thinking, there is also a bourgeois thought, and even a little landlord thought. Thus, some people have emerged: socialism is championed but not satisfied with the approach to the armed revolution. It is better not to kill a person, not to confiscate the property of landlords and capitalists, and to enter socialism peacefully, and to embrace the leadership of the Communist Party, but are not satisfied with the Communist Party's decision not to do anything. Satisfied with the proletarian dictatorship, asked to engage in parliamentary politics in socialism, is satisfied with the construction of the nation, but myself now The treatment was less than the old society would be dissatisfied. It is in favour of prioritizing the development of the electric industry, but it is not satisfied with the restrictions on their daily necessities, hate the KMT reactionaries, but somewhat unhappy with the killing of counter-revolutionaries, etc. Logically, this doesn't make sense, but that's what these people think and emotions. Transforming these people is indeed a long-term process. \\n** *\\nThe statements made by people such as Zhu Anping, Zhang Naiji and others can capture some people in society. Therefore, there is his bad influence. These anti-socialist and anti-Marxist-Leninist rhetoric must be fought relentlessly to defend socialism and Marxinism, and only to clear the line between socialism and anti-socialism, in order to further better carry out the wind. Through the struggle of two routes, we can better educate the masses, and through the struggle against the trialism, we can improve the level of Marxinism, consolidate the party's leadership, and the two routes and three are different in nature, but in broad terms, in addition to hidden counter-revolutionaries, these are all Contradictions on the ideological front of the people. Their approach is to 'unite-criticize-unite'. Some may ask whether they are also seen as contradictions within the people? Well, I would like to ask, since the bourgeois is listed as an internal issue within the people, and many of them in the bourgeois are also anti-socialist and opposition leaders (please see the Yangtze River Daily, 'Discussions between business and business people in the Riverbank District' on June 12), can they be listed in the enemy? I see that the bourgeois is inherently anti-socialist, but through the Party's education, it is possible to transform it. Of course, some people still do not completely give up his position. My understanding of such people is still counted as problems within the people. Then, their representative figures, such as Zhu Anping, Zhang Naijiu, etc., can still be counted as 'within the people', but they are the right elements within the people, who pass through Criticism and education can also be transformed into leftist elements. If the right-wing are listed as an enemy of the counter-revolution, it would be beneficial to the enemy and to the party and the people. (1957.6.00), [Propaganda Department of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Hubei People's Publishing House, 1958)\\nThird, 'Relativism'-and all comrades who criticize me\\nIf someone asks:\\nRelativism is fragrant flowers or poisons? \\nI would answer this way:\\nYou think it is fragrant flowers,\\nHe thought it was poisonous grass. \\nAnd I-\\nThink both fragrant flowers and poisons. \\nEven for you,\\nThere are also toxic grass in fragrant flowers. \\nEven for him,\\nThere are also fragrant flowers in poisons. \\nA. In 1905, Einstein published a paper on 'Theory of Relativism,' which led to a revolution in science and thought. The relativism believes that not only the phenomena used to observe nature can be relatively correct, but also to observe the activities of human society. \\nB, then, you have to Einstein's relativism truth, must be very proficient, right? \\nA, not right, but also right. There is no absolute concept of 'mastery' in the theory of relativity, only more comprehension, general, or more proficient. Due to the limited level of human knowledge, only a handful of people in the world can understand Einstein's relativism until now. At the same time, there are limits to the understanding of these people. This is because the existence of things is infinite and limited, as do humans know things. Knowledge is limited to one person or some; it is infinite for the entire history of humanity, past, present and future. I am also, because to understand Einstein's relativism, it has to have a rather deep knowledge of mathematics and physics, and because of my limited level of knowledge, I can only grasp some of its spirits, it is still very incomplete. So it may also be correct, it may be incorrect, or it may be both correct and incorrect. But at the moment for me, my relativism has a degree of correctness. \\nB, then, as you say so, is Einstein's relativism the absolute truth? \\nA、Yes, but not. Einstein himself was also subject to various conditions. Thus, the principle of relativism he understood was only relatively correct, and what he realized was only part of the treasure of human knowledge. So it's also limited. At the same time, what he has already realized, will be enriched and developed by someone else, or in the future. However, what he has already recognized now, when no one has come to enrich it, his relativism is absolutely correct for the time being. You know, if relativism is always absolutely correct, it doesn't become relativism. \\nB. Since it is right now, then, now it should be rebuttable. \\nA、Yes, but not. For now, it should be indisputable. However, the current relativism is only in its embryonic period. It is not yet perfect and not very consolidated. At the same time, the people who use it are also subject to various conditions and can sometimes be dismissed. But the so-called refuted, also only temporary, local, partial, so far, in the realm of nature. No one has denied Einstein's theory of relativity. However, relativism believes that at some point in the future, his theory may be temporarily negated. This is denied, nor can it be absolutely, forever, completely negated. Just a part of it was negated. The part of the negation, which will draw from the other side's negation, becomes relativism of one's own thing, will be supplemented by a more correct, updated understanding, and will be further developed. In the realm of human society, relativism has been temporarily denied the idealistic, incorrect part of it, but it still exists in the philosophy of materialism, and in the materialist, they believe that relativity has been denied, in fact, the materialists don't. Can leave the principle of relativity, if, Marxists' rejection of this part of the principle of relativity, Marxism Leninism it could not exist. But Marxinism is not yet relativism, and relativism have a common place, and there are different places. \\nB, then, what is relativity? \\nRelativism is a science that people use to understand the world-both natural and human society, the objective world and the subjective world. It is to analyze, synthesize, affirm, and negate the phenomena in the objective material world through human thinking activities, drawing on its more basic rules of activity, and then used to observe anything in order to achieve a more comprehensive and correct understanding of things, it is philosophical ideological A pie. \\nB, relativistic how to know the world? \\nA, relativism believes that the objective material wor"},

These exist and perceptions are interrelated and independent; mutually negative and affirmative; mutually exclusive and attractive. Relativistics know them from the process of combining them. \\nB, please give you a few specific examples. \\nA, for example: my personal presence is on June 21, 1957 at 3:30pm in Wuchang Hubei Provincial Cultural Bureau. 'June 21, 1957 at 3:30pm' is a certain time, 'Wuchang Hubei Provincial Cultural Bureau' is a certain space. Time and space are inseparable. Without 'time' it doesn't matter space, there is no time and space, anything is non-existent. We can not say: 'I exist within the Hubei Provincial Cultural Bureau'. Well, five years ago, I was not in the Hubei Provincial Cultural Bureau, and after a hundred years, I may not exist personally. Nor can I say, 'I personally exist on 21 June 1957 at 3.30 p.m.' So where do I go? Nor will anyone find my presence. But my presence, there are other conditions, just relative, temporary. With you, I, without you, there is no me, I am your objective existence, but also for what you feel, I am because I have you, but also for what I feel your existence, can realize your existence, this is only in the 'subjective and objective' 'consciousness and existence' Only exist during the binding process of'. Now the philosophers, some embrace subjective, meticulous, consciousness determines the existence of idealism, and some embrace objectivity, materialism, the existence of a materialistic ideology that determines the consciousness, and they all regard what they espoused as absolute and never denied truths, which are one-sided. They always try to deny each other, but they can't deny each other, and if they really completely deny each other, they cannot exist themselves. There is no idealism, there is no materialism theory; there is no materialism theory, no materialism; there is no objective material existence, there is no subjective consciousness; without subjective consciousness, there is nothing to do with the objective existence of material. They are mutually exclusive and attracted to each other, they are independent but interdependent, they are relatively static, essentially constant, but moving relatively, constantly changing, developing and even transforming each other. The so-called stationary or movement, cessation or development, existence or non-existence are temporary affirmations based on certain conditions, time and place. For example: stationary and motion, motion is present for stationary, motion also exists for motion, and things in motion can also be relatively stationary, stationary things can also get relative motion. Neither can be seen as absolute. All the moving substances that we are aware of and studied are the movements of an object to another object. For example, you stand on the bank and see a ship in the river, and when you're still on the bank, what you get in your consciousness is the steamboat movement, but the people on the ship, in their consciousness, get the feeling that you're also moving, or you say, it's their illusion, you do. It's still standing on the banks of the river, but the relativism believes that you are relatively stationary, but in relative terms Sporty. Because you think you're still still, it's your illusion. You know, the Earth is moving against the sun, and the space you occupy is different one minute ago or after a minute, so you're moving relatively. If you stand still on the bank of the river forever, you can also enter from the morning to noon and into the evening. Not to mention all kinds of cells, nerves and blood in your body are moving. \\nAnother example: you and me each take a ship to the same speed. Observing your ship from my ship is stationary, and only by comparing from other relatively stationary things, such as riverbanks, trees, houses, etc., can you observe that both of you and me are moving. \\nTherefore, movement and stationery are relatively simultaneous, there is no relative stationary, there is no relative movement. Now philosophers, some think things are static forever, some think movement is absolute, stationary is relative, all out of a one-sided understanding of things. \\nB, what you explained above, are mostly natural phenomena, how do relatists understand human social activities? \\nA, first of all, let me explain your problem. The so-called nature and human society are also relatively present in the process of combining each other. Without nature, human society is unthinkable, without human society, nature is meaningless. Thus, the phenomenon of human social activity cannot be observed without taking into account the relationship between humans and the natural world, and if viewed in isolation, the phenomenon of human social activity would be less correct. \\nAnyone who, from birth, is in pursuit of survival, but also in pursuit of death, when you are struggling for survival, also near death, anyone is pursuing 'good', 'beauty', 'good' and 'good' and 'good' and so on, so he also opposes 'bad' 'Ugly' 'evil' and 'harmful' things. But 'life, death' 'good, bad', 'good, evil' 'beauty, ugly' 'good, ugly' 'good, bad' are all relatively present in the process of combining each other, are relative, there is no life, it does not matter to die, life is for death. It doesn't matter good without bad, good is for the bad. It doesn't matter beauty without ugly. Beauty is for ugly. It doesn't matter good if there is no harm, and good is for harm. Everything positive is something that can be turned into the opposite, all the opposite is something positive, both sides are mutually exclusive, attractive, independent and interdependent, so everything is negating and affirming each other. There are neither absolutely positive things such as 'good', 'beauty', 'profit' and so on, nor absolutely 'bad', 'ugly', 'non-harm' and so on. Therefore, relativism believes that any person or problem is also: there must be good or bad, there must be beauty and ugly, whether it is wrong, and good will be harmful. Is good and bad, is beautiful and not beautiful, is right and not right, beneficial and unfavorable. Therefore, treating anyone or issue is neither sure nor negates everything. However, it can also be in certain conditions, time, place, for certain people or problems only to make relative affirmation, or a relative negation, so called relative, is in certain occasions there are certain conditions, there is a certain degree, that is to some people or problems think is: 'better' and 'more beautiful' 'is more favorable for' or 'worse' 'ugly' 'less correct' 'more harmful' And so on. \\nB, can you give a few specific examples to illustrate it? \\nA. Let's talk about recent domestic current events. Socialism and anti-socialism, the left and the right are fighting quite fierce. This also reflects the relativism of human social activity. Without socialism, no one will oppose socialism, if there is no anti-socialist existence, society. There would be no activists, and if there were no right-wing elements, It doesn't matter the left, not the left. Anti-socialism is detrimental to socialism, but it is also beneficial. Socialists rush back against anti-socialists is detrimental to anti-socialists, but it is also advantageous. What you think of as advocates of socialism is not always socialist. Similarly, you think of anti-socialist people, not all anti-socialist, the left can be transformed into the right, and the right can be transformed into the left. \\nB. Why do anti-socialists not benefit socialism, but also socialism? \\nA. Anti-socialists have taken advantage of the shortcomings and mistakes of the Communist Party to oppose socialism and to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party. This is not conducive to socialism and the Communist Party. At the same time, the public offensive by a minority right is a call to other right-wing elements to lead them and organize them to attack the Communist Party. At the same time, it is possible that some of the masses, especially those who in the past have caused some loss or dissatisfaction due to shortcomings and mistakes in the work of some Communist Party members or cadres, to the right, which has weakened the party's mass base relatively. \\nBut for the Communist Party, the right is now appearing, making it easier to fight against them, which is easier than to deal with hidden right-wing elements, while also allowing most of the masses to see the right-wing anti-socialist face and get education from it. Thus, at the same time, it also consolidated the party's mass base and enabled the Party and the people to exercise. That's what is good for socialism. \\nB, why say, the struggle between the two routes is also beneficial and unfavorable for the right-wing elements? \\nA, two lines of struggle revealed a number of right-wing elements, who erroneously estimated the power and situation on both sides. From the contrast between the forces of the left and right, they were clearly against them, and as a result, they were going to fail. So it's bad for the right-wing elements. But at the same time it is a good lesson for the right to correct their mistakes for the time being, and a rather valuable practical experience for those who have not yet been exposed, allowing them to remain more covert and stand by. This is in favor of the right-wing. \\nB. Why do you say that advocates of socialists are not always socialists, and anti-socialists are not always anti-socialists? \\nA, as already mentioned above, in addition to the revealed right-wing elements, there are hidden right-wing elements. At this time, the most advantageous way for them is to rise up against the right, to show that they are the left, adopt this strategy, on the one hand to save themselves, and to be able to temporarily acquire the party and The trust of the masses. There is also a kind of people, two lines of struggle, for them, is a better opportunity to behave themselves, deceive trust, in order to achieve personal purposes. This category of people, though superficially makes you think of socialism, is not in essence socialism. But when you don't perceive it, they always think they are socialist. \\nWhy don't anti-socialists necessarily be anti-socialists? This is to look at this problem in terms of the development of awareness, there is a group of people who are more socialist, but in old societies they are fammed by the idea of bourgeois democracy, not consciously, and think that this idea is socialist, so that they may to varying degrees of anti-socialist rhetoric, a person who is the right or may be the center, but after criticism , education, and struggle, can be transformed into the left. \\nB, then do you think that the struggle between the two lines is an internal contradiction among the people? Or the enemy contradiction? \\nA, it is both a contradiction within the people, and a contradiction against me. The struggle of two routes is the ideological class struggle. As socialist and anti-socialist, pro-party and anti-party, are confrontational contradictions and contradictions of an enemy nature. But as an ideological struggle, the struggle between Marxinism and anti-Marxism is an internal contradiction among the people. The right-wing elements are still the people and their internal contradictions. But if there might be hidden anti-revolutionaries, or those right-wing elements went to the counter-revolution, when they were discovered, after they ran over, it would be an enemy contradiction. Therefore, I think it is a contradiction within the people, not just within the people. It is against me, and not against me. It is both a contradiction within the people, but also a contradiction between the enemy and me. This is based on certain conditions, time and place. Any disadvantage to the people is beneficial to the enemy, and thus objectively helps the enemy, whose role can sometimes be far greater than that of an anti-revolutionary. Even the contradictions against me can be seen as internal contradictions, which can turn negative into advantage. Broadly speaking, they are internal contradictions. \\nB, then, how should this definition of people be interpreted? \\nA, the definition of people is unstable, has its relative nature, the scope it covers. It is also transferred with certain conditions, time and place. For example, during the war of resistance against Japan, people included workers, farmers, intellectuals, landowners, rich farmers and even members of the National Party. The people called after the Soviet revolution in October did not include capitalists, and China's current people included capitalists, but the people in the slogan of 'serving the people' proposed by Chairman Mao, if they were to include capitalists, it would be contrary to Chairman Mao's intent. Similarly, if workers, farmers and soldiers in the 'service for workers, peasants and soldiers' include bullies, foremen, rich farmers, and soldiers in the anti-revolutionary army, it is also contrary to Chairman Mao's intent, so these slogans are also unstable. \\nTherefore, capitalists are people, but not people, landowners cannot be counted as people, but they have also been counted as people and may also be people in the future. In my opinion, you are the people, and in Chiang Kai-shek you are the enemy. Chiang Kai-shek is an enemy, but can be counted as a people after he surrendered. \\nB, do you think the Communist Party is good? \\nA, you probably refer to the Communist Party of China. If this is the case, it would also be incomprehensible. To isolate the Chinese Communist Party, it doesn't matter well. It is to look at the relationship between the Communist Party of China and its masses, in terms of personal relations with me. The so-called relationship is diverse, and the basic relationship is a stake. If the implementation of the CPC's policy and policy is beneficial to the masses, and it is not only that the Communist Party people subjectively consider it beneficial, but also objectively, the masses and I personally realize that it is beneficial, then the group I will think the CPC is good, and will embrace it. If, on the contrary, the policy guidelines of the Chinese Communist Party and its implementation are detrimental to the masses and to me, then it will be considered bad. Not only do not support it, but also oppose it. The so-called masses and me are not absolute and relative, which means who, for example, the Communist Party of China advocates the elimination of exploitation and the establishment of a socialist society in China, as well as taking a series of concrete measures to achieve this, so that the living and cultural standards of the working people can continuously improve; Well, it is advantageous for the working people and against the exploiters. Therefore, the working people think the Communist Party of China is good , Socialism is good, embrace it. The exploiters, for their part, believe that the Communist Party of China is bad and socialism is not good, they oppose it. If I was a working people, I would support it; if I was an explorer, I would oppose it. The so-called good or bad, advantageous or unfavorable, is also relative, from comparison. Only better, more advantageous things. There is no absolutely good or absolutely advantageous thing. For example, the Chinese Communist Party is better than the Chinese Kuomintang. Therefore, although China's national capitalists, by their class nature, should be opposed to the Communist Party. However, because the Chinese Communist Party's policy is better than the Kuomintang and the way in which the Communist Party of the Soviet Union treated their bourgeoisies at the time of the October revolution, China's national capitalists may think that the CPC is still better, and therefore embrace it. As far as working people are concerned, the policy of the Communist Party of China was beneficial to the working people at that time, but when fighting with the Kuomintang in the past, it would inevitably make some of the working people involved in the war (whether in the army led by the Communist Party or in the army led by the KMT), (People), died as a result of war, which is also relatively unfavorable to the working people who died. So you can answer your question: the CPC is good, but not good. \\nB, then, your main thing is not stable class position. \\nA, right, but not right. Relativissts believe that the so-called class position is only a theoretical weapon that serves a certain class. Therefore, the issue of the position is also relative. Communist parties demand that the working people stand firm on the proletarian position, but they do not want capitalists to stabilize the bourgeoisie position. The same is true in turn. The Communist Party opposes the fear of death and surrender to the enemy, but also welcomes enemies who fear death to surrender to him, which is one-sided in nature. Therefore, it does not matter the question of the position, but when I am now a part of the Chinese people, and I think that after liberation is better than before liberation, the Communist Party is better than the Kuomintang, then I should look at the problem from the Chinese people's position. Therefore, I also think I am more stable in the position of the Chinese people. As far as you think that I am not on the ground, or that I do not have a position, that is your subjective perception, or that I do not have a position, or I do not have a position at all, please indicate it specifically so that I can correct it. Or your subjective illusion. \\nB, however, I feel that you have a nihilistic thought and attitude. \\nA, right, but not right. As I have said earlier, it seems like nihilism from relativistics that neither affirm everything nor negate everything, but relativism is relative affirmative to certain people or issues in certain conditions, times and places. I am also, from the point of view of the Chinese Communist Party advocating the realization of socialism in China, it is better than capitalism, and the CPC is better than the Kuomintang in its policy guidelines, so I will temporarily affirm it and embrace it. But not to say, I have supported it since childhood, so when I was a child, I did not support the Communist Party of China. I used to support the Kuomintang. What about in the future? Nor is it certain that if, when my mind turns right, or the Chinese Communist Party becomes a communist party like Yugoslavia, I will not support it. \\nB. Well, you are also only temporarily supporting the CPC. Wouldn't this not be without the determination to follow the Communist Party to Communism forever? \\nA, yes, not. From the point of view of my current support for the CPC, it is temporary, not permanent. But the continuum of temporary support becomes relatively and forever. In terms of time, one day, January, year, ten years are temporary, limited. However, the continuous day of the day becomes forever, infinite. And I can only survive for a certain period of time, say 50 years, 100 years, there are limits. So it's 'relatively always upheld'. There can't be absolutely always embracing. Because I will die in 50 years, 100 years later, then I will not feel anymore, so it doesn't matter to embrace it. So if you want me to say it is: always advocating the Communist Party, logically, is a self-deceiving claim. \\nB, ah ah, I talked to you for half a day, I was still confused, I can't remember, how do I go to study it? \\nA, or, I teach you a few tips, you experience, experiment and apply it. \\n(1)\\nYou say this line length, I say this line is short; both long and short, short and long; long and short, short and long; there must be short, no short is no long; whether it is long or short, you want to contest. Both go to the contest, only relatively short to be longer. \\n(ii)\\nYou say this big, I say this small; is small and large, large and small; large and small; small and large; there are also large in small, large and small; there must be large, no big, no small: whether it is large or small, please go to compare; since the comparison, only relatively large to smaller. \\n(iii)\\nYou say this is 2, I say 2 is not 2; you say it must be 2, I say maybe a 2, 2, you say 1+1 = 2, I say 2 is not 2; you say it must be 2, I say 1+1 may =3, or 1+1 or =1. How much do you say, I said you go to the experiment to know. \\n(iv)\\nYou say this thing is good, I say it is bad; both good and bad, bad and good; good and bad, bad, good; good and bad, bad must be good; whether it is bad or good, please go compare, you go to compare, only bad to be better.

In the labour rehabilitation unit, inmates in re-education through labour coexisted together. For the convenience of their names, they were called re-education inmates and inmates in re-education through labour, respectively, had to work under the supervision of gunpoint. At the end of three years, release from re-education through labour and forced employment, labour must still be carried out at invisible gunpoint monitoring. Re-education through labour, leave for employment for a full decade, and suffered psychological and physical persecution. Ten years of loss of liberty, working under muzzle surveillance, anyone can imagine how much suffering would be. Three years of extraordinary disasters, lack of harvest of food and cotton and food and food insecurity, especially labor reform units, use hunger and cold to summarize it. The stomach is hungry, with wolf chicken grass, no wolf chicken grass, instead of the diamond thorn.

For the sake of democracy, in order to defend the rights of the people and to ask for the people, he retired from the party. He was living in the society alone, fighting evil and doing good. The result was a 'crime of subverting the state power', first of all criminal detention., then announced the arrest, sentencing four years, put into labor, and the Chinese people and the world are rescuing. And his daughter is studying in college and still graduating from two and a half years. His wife has no official job, has no fixed income, her daughter is studying, what to do? Pan zhongyu Zhongyu immediately uses 'Take three thousand first, then take it later' as 'what to do?' The answer. I want to make 5-6 elders financially support Xiao Lu's study, so that she and everyone take a photo and leave a memorial. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu made it clear that taking pictures, he opposed. I gave the money to Lv Gengsong's wife and asked her to call Pan zhongyu Zhongyu to thank him, and at the same time, to prove that my money was handed over to Lv wife. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu Lima said that absolutely believed me Ye Lao, she did not have to thank. So, I had great interest in Pan zhongyu Zhongyu's elderly people, and had a deep understanding of him. \\nA Tribulation Childhood\\nPan zhongyu Zhongyu was born on July 12, 1934 in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, a yellow chartered family, his father is a poor force, no good eating, not wearing, no good living, no good line, much more can't talk about going to school. In addition, he died of a young mother, his father continued to marry, raised three more brothers and sisters, and the hardship of a family's livelihood did not speak. As an elder brother, to help his father, participate in labor, support the family. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu's life can be said not a day to go to formal school, watching someone else's children carrying a school bag and go to school happily, he can't say envy. \\nAt the age of 12, Pan zhongyu Zhongyu entered the church-run charity Hangzhou Children's Worship Office (later renamed the Anglican Children's Hospital). Pan zhongyu Zhongyu seizes this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do everything he can to do all of his ability and learn cultural knowledge as hungry. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu's labor has been praised, and his learning has evolved with the day. \\nAt the age of 15, Pan zhongyu Zhongyu Children's Hospital was renamed Hangzhou Huazang Temple Lane Primary School. Also this year, the People's Republic of China was founded. The people's power is defending the interests of workers and farmers, and the climate is very favorable to Pan zhongyu Zhongyu. In addition, he has worked hard, honestly, and made remarkable progress. A regular handyman in elementary school. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu is really happy! \\nAnyone working in school always has more opportunities to study than other units. Of course, Pan zhongyu Zhongyu is no exception. He was a handyman for seven years, practiced a good word, Fang Zheng is good, and various subjects such as language and mathematics are self-taught, raising the level of ability to engage in primary school teaching work. I was born to be useful. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu looked forward to the people's choice with confidence and chose this self-taught person to better serve the people. \\nWhen Pan zhongyu Zhongyu was 22 years old, if he wished to pay, the school officially hired him as a teacher, went to the podium and taught Abacus. From a handyman, leaping to an engineer of the soul of the people, Pan zhongyu Zhongyu is even satisfied and even happy. The reason why he can become a teacher should be grateful to the Party and the Government for their training and reuse, and also to thank colleagues and schools for their help and carrying, and three must affirm his perseverance and hard work. He aspires to move to a better future. \\nPan zhongyu Zhongyu is immersed in the dream of a beautiful life and no future. \\ntwo flies in the wrong\\nPan zhongyu Zhongyu became a teacher and asked himself more strictly to learn, study and re-study, and to improve the level of cultural science and political theory. He understands in his heart that the reason why he can be a teacher of the people is inseparable from the education and training of the Party. The grace of dripping water should be rewarded with the spring. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu himself vowed to reward the Party and the people for life. \\nIn 1957, Mao Zedong publicly invited people from various democratic parties and intellectuals upstairs in Tiananmen City to give opinions to the Party and help the Party to rectify. Then, Party committees at all levels of the Communist Party of China have repeatedly mobilized, demanding that they speak without saying anything, and ensure that they do not wear hats, do not hit sticks, and do not count accounts after autumn. Intellectuals have all acted. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu was born in poverty, had long been educated, trained by the Party and was a teacher of the people. Of course, he should listen to Chairman Mao and walk with the Communist Party. Therefore, he responded positively to the call and put into the big song, magnification, big print and debate. \\nThe ownership of the country is the people, not a political party, and that is what is truly the people's ownership. Since it is the people's ownership, the political party governing the country should and must be left to the choice of the people. It must not be left to the sole discretion of a political party. The heads of organs, regardless of their size, must be led by party members. The leadership culture is low and does not understand, it is difficult to get a good job. Understandable, non-party leadership cadres with culture have jobs and do not have power, and it is also difficult to get a good job. Why is there a secret Communist Party member in a democratic party, who should make it clear and open the status of Communist Party members. If not, they become plainclothes policemen. \\nPan zhongyu Zhongyu used these specific examples to criticize one-party dictatorship. This would undoubtedly impose the charges of the opposition leadership at the time when it came to reverse the right. In fact, in half a century later today, the former Soviet Union dissolved itself, abolished one-party dictatorship, and the opposing party of the Chinese Communist Party, the China Democratic Party, imposed an open party ban and abolished one-party dictatorship, can confirm that Pan zhongyu Zhongyu's It is not wrong to say that democracy will ultimately prevail and replace autocracy, and the rule of law will ultimately prevail and replace dictatorship. \\nBefore Mao Zedong inspected the small camp alley, dozens of people's police supervised residents sweeping the ground, weeding weeding and doing a great deal of hygiene. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu thinks that doing superficial articles does not mean much more practical. It is better to take a micro-service visit, personally observe the suffering of the folk, and solve some specific difficulties. Mao Zedong is a man, not God. It is unrealistic to talk only about Mao Zedong's great achievements. It is not realistic to talk about Mao Zedong's glorious, great, correct, and not to talk about Mao Zedong's mistakes and shortcomings. This would undoubtedly impose the charges of attacking and slandering the great leader Mao Zedong. In fact, as everyone knows now, Mao Zedong is a tyrant hundreds of times more than the Qin Emperor, and Mao Zedong's iniquity is as much as Stalin and Hitler. \\nThe Soviet Union sent troops to Hungary, known as aid, is indeed aggression. Hungary is an independent state, and its internal affairs are not subject to interference by other countries. \\nThe launch of satellites in the Soviet Union was successful, and the aerospace industry in the United States was thriving. This was when it came to the right, it was inevitable to impose charges of susceptible anti-Soviet and hostility to socialism. In fact, Putin has publicly apologized for sending troops to Hungary by the Soviet Union. The collapse of the Soviet Union, the collapse and disintegration of the USSR led socialist camp, and the fact that the United States remains, shows that the latter's vitality is much greater than the former. \\nAs long as the country master the food policy, do not carry out the general purchase and sale, it does not need to use tickets such as food stamps, cloth tickets and other tickets. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu wrote the Zhang Daobao newspaper with the title of 'Tickets for the Money': 'Food stamps: wealthy people have no food tickets to the wine house, eat like the food. No money people are queued up quite long, and they have been hungry. Badge: Each person is four per year, seemingly fair. Wealthy people are not enough to buy wool, but not enough for people who have no money. Oil stamps: two or two per person per month, rich people's oil tickets are not enough to eat lard, and no money household oil tickets are not enough to boil water. Sugar tickets: Wealthy people's sugar tickets are not enough to eat glucose. Money people can only touch hard with light, eat light soup. At that time, it was necessary to impose the crime of attacking the party's policy. In fact, there are no tickets such as food stamps, cloth tickets, oil tickets, sugar tickets and other tickets. The market is running as well, and people live like this.' \\nPan zhongyu Zhongyu said these words. Even if he was born and painful, motivated, energetic, and worked well, he could not escape the crime of anti-party anti-social righteousness. He was caught in Mao Zedong's' Yang Mou ', which became a right-wing member who had called thousands of people at that time. \\nThree bitter sea boundless\\nIn March 1958, Pan zhongyu Zhongyu according to the two types of treatment, delegated to the Linping Wengmei commune Xi'an brigade to supervise labor. Physical labor is not a big problem for Pan zhongyu Zhongyu, who is suffering from a bitter origin, with a little exercise, that is to be able to adapt. And mental pain, he always can not get rid of. Heaven engaged in manual labor, not tired, can hear the naive children singing 'socialism is good... right people can't counteract', really worried pain. Listen to Mao Zedong and go with the Communist Party. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu is unswerving. Why should I listen to Mao Zedong, give opinions to the Party and help the Party to get the wind, but to subordinate to the right-wing opposition and anti-socialist elements? Why did Mao Zedong engage in 'Yang Mou'? It really doesn't make sense. In addition, labor has to exert physical energy, appetite soars, food is not enough, hungry stomach, but insist on labor, this painful taste, only yourself know. This inhuman life has elapsed four years. It is a bitter sea boundless. \\nIn the spring of 1962, cotton grain is not harvested, food and clothing are not insecure, and the consequences of the disaster for three years became apparent. So, the right wing, which devolved rural supervision of labor, concentrated on Yuhang Pingshan Farm, renovated and studied, with the aim of returning home and finding a way out of their own, in order to reduce the burden on the country. At that time, each person received a certificate issued by the Xiacheng District People's Committee of Hangzhou. It is clear in the book that the original position of primary school teacher and voluntary retirement is necessary to make a note: to prove that Pan zhongyu Zhongyuyuan is a primary school teacher, this is in line with the facts. However, when implementing the policy, he said that Pan zhongyu Zhongyu is a handyman who has never read a book and has no culture., is contradictory; it is not voluntary resignation, but organizational mobilization, organizational mobilization, is irresistible. Disguised coercion, anyone is helpless. It is a bitter sea boundless. \\nPan zhongyu Zhongyu retired home, only got a retirement pension of 406 yuan. It can not take many days, the money spent fine light, what to do? Find a job, as much as the heaven, do business, no money, the only way to live is to sell hard force. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu was 28 years old. Some of them were hard, but the buyer who did not know the goods, well when his father pulled the board truck, helped his father back fibers. One could reduce his father's labor expenditure, two can make a little money. Later, Pan zhongyu Zhongyu picked the trans, walked the streets and lanes, shouting: 'Stir fried rice!' Invite business, in order to live, really bitter sea side. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu is bitter enough, but the unimaginable, more bitter life is still behind! \\nIn 1974, that is, when he was 30 years old, the public security organs of the 'people' falsely accused him of treason. They did not have any evidence or physical evidence of treason, nor could they put out the 'enemy' who was the 'enemy', let alone not listen to Pan zhongyu Zhongyu's arguments, and sentenced him to three years of re-education through labour. At the time of promulgation of the regulations on re-education through labour, the capital referred to as re-education through labour, and provincial cities called them re-education through labour. In the labour rehabilitation unit, inmates in re-education through labour coexisted together. For the convenience of their names, they were called re-education inmates and inmates in re-education through labour, respectively, had to work under the supervision of gunpoint. At the end of three years, release from re-education through labour and forced employment, labour must still be carried out at invisible gunpoint monitoring. Re-education through labour, leave for employment for a full decade, and suffered psychological and physical persecution. Ten years of loss of liberty, working under muzzle surveillance, anyone can imagine how much suffering would be. Three years of extraordinary disasters, lack of harvest of food and cotton and food and food insecurity, especially labor reform units, use hunger and cold to summarize it. The stomach is hungry, with wolf chicken grass, no wolf chicken grass, instead of the diamond thorn. Eat King Kong thorn, you can temporarily famine, but immediately caused closed, pull, to some extent, closed more painful than hunger. Not enough to eat, wear not warm, mental pain infinite, but to high-intensity physical labor. Cut firewood, climb the mountains, will cut, will bundle, will rush, also have to pick down the mountain, cutting firewood is the top priority of labor. Once, Pan zhongyu Zhongyu chopped firewood accidentally, rolled down from the mountains, hard friends thought that Pan zhongyu Zhongyu was destined to West Day, went to the bliss world, but Pan zhongyu Zhongyu commanded great, did not hurt the bones, just a little skin injury, really no mother's son God bless it! Do not go to the bliss world, you have to bitter sea! \\nIn 1984, the labor reform unit cleaned up Pan zhongyu Zhongyu home, he returned to Hangzhou. People who are released from labor and who return to their homes are all considered to be an unstable factor. Although they do not have to be monitored at gunpoint as they did during labor reform, there are still certain restrictions to be forced to place in units designated by the neighborhood committee. Therefore, Pan zhongyu Zhongyu worked in the 57 group of Marshal Marshal Temple in Pi Shi Lane, working daily Zip anise. Although wages are low and labor is difficult, but after all, there is some freedom for the person. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu began to file a complaint. It is impossible to reconcile the grievances and Zhaoxue, but there have been some improvements. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu was transferred to Xiaoying Street Plastic Packaging Factory for labor, raising the salary to one yuan a day. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu single person, bitterness, really bitter sea boundless! \\nIn 1978, document No. 5 of the CPC Central Committee was issued to correct errors and resume work for the right. It seems that Pan zhongyu Zhongyu is going to have no potential for the future, but no, Pan zhongyu Zhongyu is still unable to get rid of the borderlands of the bitter sea. \\nFour disguised abuse\\nIn 1978, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued document No. 5, on correcting and resuming the work of the right, and the right, who had been persecuted for two years, shouted with one voice: dawn! Dawn! The vast majority of the right have been able to implement policies, rejoin the revolutionary ranks and work again, with the exception of Pan zhongyu Zhongyu. \\nComrade from the Implementation Policy Office of the CPC Shangcheng District Committee asked Pan zhongyu Zhongyu to talk to him that the policy is to be implemented for you. However, your mistakes in vicious attacks and scorn against the great leader Mao must be reunderstood and checked out. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu believes that it is now in 1978. Mao Zedong's mistakes against the right and the Cultural Revolution have been exhaustive. It is well known that it is widely accepted that it is not appropriate to write checks. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu has rejected the 'instruction' to write checks. \\nIn 1979, the CPC Shangcheng District Committee implementation policy office placed Pan zhongyu Zhongyu to the Hangzhou Municipal Construction Bureau to report for work, the Construction Bureau placed Pan zhongyu Zhongyu to the construction company, the company placed Pan zhongyu Zhongyu in the construction site to pull the manpower board truck at the construction site, specializing in Huangsha and Stone. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu thinks: 1, non-educational units of construction companies, not in accordance with their own expertise, volunteerism; 2, a large pallets are 20 pounds, this overload of heavy labor, he can not adapt, competency; 3, this is not the implementation of policy, but disguised abuse; 4, this placement is contrary to national laws and party of the policy. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu repeatedly and again asked to return to the education system, even if he was a handyman, willingly and willingly refused. This is a retaliation and blow to Pan zhongyu Zhongyu's refusal to examine. \\nHangzhou Shangcheng District Education Bureau under the pretext that Pan zhongyu Zhongyuyuan is located in Huazang Temple Lane primary school is a school belonging to the Education Bureau of the Xiacheng District. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu was a right-wing in the lower city education bureau at that time. Now, although Huazang Temple Primary School has been assigned to the Shangcheng District Education Bureau, Pan zhongyu Zhongyu should still be implemented by the Xiacheng District Education Bureau to implement the policy, refuse cesium to accept Pan zhongyu In Yu. Pan zhongyu Zhongyuyuan is a teacher of the education system. The Central Committee stipulates that in principle, Pan zhongyu Zhongyu should return to the education system. As for returning to the Education Bureau, it can be resolved in a coordinated manner. Not to arrange educational work for Pan zhongyu Zhongyu, while placing heavy physical labor is inappropriate and contrary to the spirit of central policy. \\nPan zhongyu Zhongyu insisted on the letter and the Mayor of Hangzhou Qiu Baoxing instructed Zhang Ming, the mayor of Shangcheng District, and Zhang invited the Deputy Governor of South Korea Xi to coordinate a settlement. The Coordination Committee opened a head. Han Deputy Governor excuse 'I was busy'. Once he went, the Coordination Committee could not be able to go, Pan zhongyu Zhongyu had to leave with tears. Afterwards, Pan zhongyu Zhongyu called the Bureau of Letters and Calls again. The receptionist informed that the CCCC feedback said that you are an unculturally uneducated cleaner and that the school does not accept it. The fight against the right was initiated, led, implemented and implemented by the CCP. It should also be the CCP's responsibility for correcting mistakes. Qiu Bao-hing, Zhang Mingfang, and South Korea Hei are all city and district executive leaders and have no right to correct the mistakes of the CCP. Chu Bao-hing's 'Reading Office', Zhang Mingfang's 'Referral', and Korean Hei's 'coordination' are 100 percent 'pervasive' and cannot be fruitful. \\nHe said that Pan zhongyu Zhongyu has no culture. That is Hu Wu. If there is no culture, how can the school hire him as a teacher? Pan zhongyu Zhongyu was a handyman, but at the right time he was a registered teacher. If you beat handymen into the right, it would be wrong, because the CCP policy stipulates that workers are not allowed to hit the right. \\nPan zhongyu Zhongyu insisted on the letter and Mayor Chou Bao-hing also instructed the Director of the Municipal Personnel Bureau Lu Guoqing to implement the policy for Pan zhongyu Zhongyu. Korea Hei is a member of the Democratic Party (sometimes the dog is more vicious than the owner). He is unable to do so. Director Lu had to make a report that 'policy has long been implemented'. But Director Lu pragmatically added: as to why Comrade Pan zhongyu Zhongyu could not return to the education system, the correct answer could not be found for the time being. This sentence is true and an expression of justice, but it is a tickening of the boots to no avail. \\nWhile not implementing policies for Pan zhongyu Zhongyu, it also created a lot of gossip. What said 'Street factory wages more than 40 yuan per month, school salary is only 35 yuan, is not to return to school.' This is a rumor. To Pan zhongyu Zhongyu to pull the 20-pound manpower truck, he refused, is completely legitimate. He was not allowed to go to school, even if he was a handyman again. \\nIn order to survive, Pan zhongyu Zhongyu returned to the street factory. What to say, 'It's been so long, still come to find trouble'. \\nAs early as the implementation of the policy office asked him to pull the manpower truck, Pan zhongyu Zhongyu expressed his objection, but he insisted on his appeal, of course, not subject to the time limit. What say, 'Some labor models, factory managers are also laid off, you have pension'. \\nLaid-off personnel have no grievances, there are opportunities for re-employment, and Pan zhongyu Zhongyu is correct and correct, and it is entirely legitimate to ask for the implementation of policies like other right-hand teachers. These are two things that are absolutely different in nature. \\nIn 2007, on the fiftieth anniversary of the struggle against the right, the Central Office of the Communist Party of China (CPC), issued the 'Certain Opinions on the Issue of the 1957 Anti-Right Movement', the second article of which clearly states: 'In the case of those who were classified as right-wing, politically, organizationally, work-affected and damaged, the relevant departments, the unit should be properly resolved, arranged, do not put the issue on hand.' Pan zhongyu Zhongyu also lodged an appeal to the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, without receiving any approval. \\nIn political terms, Pan zhongyu Zhongyu seems to have a bitter sea for life. Unfortunately, when Pan zhongyu Zhongyu was 46 years old, he married a rural woman in the suburbs. Poor and poor couples were suffering together, and lived a poor and happy old life. This is the sky with eyes! \\nFive Constitution Supreme\\nThe fight against the right was initiated and led by the late Chairman of the CPC Central Committee Mao Zedong himself, and was jointly implemented and implemented by the CPC Committee at all levels. In mainland China, the land, rich, anti-counterfeiting, and bad are investigated and punished in accordance with national laws, while the right party committees at all levels are investigated and punished on the basis of the documents of the Party of the Communist Party. \\nThe CPC charter stipulates that the highest penalty of the Party against party members is the dismissal of the party. The Party's statutes do not contain the function of directly investigating and punishing non-party citizens. Party committees at all levels of the CPC directly give non-party citizens a right hat, which is contrary to the party's statutes. The highest organ of State power (NPC), has not given the CPC the power to directly investigate and prosecute non-party citizens. Party committees at all levels of the CPC directly penalize non-party citizens wearing right-wing hats, contrary to the law. All democratic parties of the CPC and all democratic parties should be politically equal and organizationally independent. Party committees at all levels of the CPC directly penalize members of various democratic parties wearing the right, contrary to the principle of organization. Today, no political party in the world has the right to directly prosecute citizens who are not their own party. It is entirely illegal for Party committees at all levels of the CPC to wear right-wing hats directly to non-party citizens (including members of various democratic parties). \\nArticle 41 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China states: 'Persons who have suffered damages as a result of violations of civil rights by State organs and agents shall have the right to compensation in accordance with the law'. The intra-party funders were compensated in accordance with this provision of the Constitution. The policy of the Communist Party of China stipulates that the right will only give political correction and no economic compensation. It must be pointed out that the denial of national constitutional provisions by the provisions of the CPC policy is an unconstitutional offence. Both the capitalists and the right are wrong cases. It is unjust that the funders pay compensation in accordance with the provisions of the national constitution, and the right does not pay compensation in accordance with the provisions of the CPC policy. \\nThe CCP has made two major mistakes in investigating and punishing the anti-right struggle: 1. The CCP openly admits that the anti-right struggle error rate is above 99.999%, but does not completely deny it. Instead, it is presumed to be 'enlarged'. What is the 'expansion' of more than 99.999% in the world? Unrealistic. 2. The CCP issued a decision to correct the right to correct and correct the wrong, but disregarded the law and did not pay compensation. There is no rule of law. \\nIt is trivial for the CCP to correct and resume its work only to the right. It should and must apologize and compensate in order to safeguard the dignity of the Constitution. The national constitution is the embodiment of the common interests and common will of the people throughout the country. Disregard for the law and lawlessness, which is not only the right, but also for the people of the country to suffer. The Chinese people should and must vow to defend the dignity of the Constitution. \\nConstitutional Supreme! \\nSix expensive to insist\\nPan zhongyu Zhongyu's heart is what anyone can think of, what to do? Pan zhongyu Zhongyu was inspired by the practice of Yue-Fei's descendants in lawsuits. \\nIn 132 AD, Yue Fei was commanded to Shoujiangzhou (now Jiangxi Jiujiang). Since then, Yue family members moved here to live. Three years after Yue Fei's death, his wife, Li, died in Jiangzhou, and Song Xiaozongqin Sun Mountain was buried, just a stone's throw from the tomb of Mother-in-law Shining like arrows, 30 years of fingers. 159 years, Ning Wang Zhu Chen Hao chaos, trapped Jiangzhou, Yuefei descendants refuge in Hubei. After the chaos of Ning Wang subsided, Yue's family did not return to Jiangzhou, and the cemetery was unattended, so it became Arazuka In 153 years, Jiang Zhou official Chen Shouren fancy Sun Mountain, erased the records of Yuejia tomb in the Fuzhi, replaced by his own ancestor tomb, into the Fuzhi. In 1629, Yuejia descendants Yue Lianxiao returned from this lake to Jiangzhou sacrifice, found Yue Jia tomb occupied, to Yamen, County officials saw Yue family tree, known as Song Xiao Zong Qin ci, won Yue Jia victory. After Chen's family learned that Chen Shouren amended, deleted the tomb of Yue's family and replaced him with the prefect of Chen Jiazu tomb, to Yamen, and county officials sentenced Chen Jia to win the case. Since then, Yue's family has repeatedly failed. At the dying of Yue Lianxiao commanded his children to continue until the case was successful. In 1740, Yue Sixian, a descendant of Yue's family, came to Beijing on the basis of the premier prefecture prepared by Chen Shouren, containing the Sun Mountain as the House of Yue's Tomb. Qianlong Yu pen waved the holy tenet: Sun Mountain returned Yue's family, Chen Jiazu tomb still remained in place, and sparse mud. Until Qianlong died, Chen's later people raised the case, and they actually did the same, and repeatedly failed. In the Republic of the Republic of China \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), later Chen's family came to the Nanjing Supreme Court. The court had decided that Chen's accusators were jailed to death by the elders of Chen's parents, Yue and Chen's two families were deeply resentful. After liberation \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), Jiangxi Provincial People's Government officially identified Yuejia tomb as a provincial protection of cultural relics. In the next 40 years, Yue and Chen have nothing to do with them. On March 13, 1980, the 895th anniversary of Yue Fei's birth was held, Yuefei descendants went to Sun Mountain ancestors, found that Chen Jiazu tomb increased by 3 meters unprovoked, stagnated his wife's tomb. After full consultation, Chen family agreed to move out of Sun Mountain, and Yuejia descendants eventually won 370 years of victory. \\nPan zhongyu Zhongyu realized from it that 50 years have passed since the struggle against the right, the CCP, by virtue of its great power, does not apologize, do not pay compensation, and seek to repress Zhang. This can only be bullied for a while, and cannot oppress the I. Complaints are in the hands of the law, reasonable, persevering, perseverance. It is essential that jurisprudence negate the right and comply with constitutional claims, but perseverance and perseverance are also indispensable. \\nThe fight against the right is all wrong and illegal, and there is no need to look for reasons and evidence like the children of Yue's family did. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu will form a text on his experiences of grievances, suffering, and suffocations, and then appends the decision to correct the mistakes and rectification of the party's big print, and put forth his own clear request for 'apology, compensation' and instruct future generations to claim claims against the CCP on his behalf. This"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": " will not fail when the State is genuinely governed by the rule of law. \\nThe film 'The Legend of Tianyun Mountain', 'The Wrangler', Zhang Yihe's 'Past Is Not Like Tobacco', Dai Huang's 'Nine Dead Life', and Hefeng's 'Experience-My 1957' touching and tear. All the works of the right have allowed more people to understand deeply that the fight against the right is one of the most grievances in China's history, the widest in the history of the company, the greatest harm, the most overcast means, the longest, and more than a hundred times more than a hundred times the book pit of the Qin Shihuang. The flesh of the right can be wiped out, but their writings, their spirituality, are endless. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu also writes 'Abuse or Implementing Policy?' Tell people about their misfortunes. \\nThe fight against the right was initiated, led, implemented and implemented by the CCP. The CCP openly admitted that the anti-right struggle was above 99.999%, but it did not completely deny it, and also characterized as 'expansion' and decided not to apologize and not to pay compensation. This is the sin of a one-party dictator. Since then, Pan zhongyu Zhongyu's attitude towards the Chinese Communist Party has changed fundamentally. What to do with the CCP? Opposing the CCP, no, if it is opposed, even what the CCP is right, it will also oppose it. In the same vein, the CCP cannot be supported. If it does, even what the CPC is wrong, it also supports it. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu asked the public to take such an attitude: CCP's right, support, CCP's mistakes, opposition; CPC elite, support, CCP scum, opposition. In this way, to achieve the objective of opening up the party ban and abolishing one-party dictatorial rule. \\nThe country and the Communist Party fought in war, who wins the ruling, who is the exclusive power, who loses the knockout or who bereves the right, the one-party dictatorship is created The ruling party in a democratic State is elected by the people. The people decide which political party is in power and which political party is in the wild. The former, power is in the hands of the party, the latter, in the hands of the people. The State has a one-party dictatorship, and the people cannot elect this party, which denies the people the most basic right to democratic elections. The gradual triumph of democracy, the substitution of authoritarianism, the rule of law and the substitution of dictatorship is an objective rule that does not transfer people's will. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu believes that the people of the whole country should rise up and build their great motherland into a democratic and rule-of-law country. If this is the case, the country will surely prosper and prosper, the people will be happy and happy. The Chinese Communist Party apologizes and compensates those who have suffered losses in the fight against the right. \\nSeven patriotic patriots\\nPan zhongyu Zhongyu concluded that he, as a Chinese, should and must love his motherland and people. \\nThe Olympic Games were held in Beijing, China in 2008. This is an honor for China and an honor for the Chinese people. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu is very happy! He follows any information about the holding of the Olympic Games. \\nOn May 21, 22 and 23, 2007, respectively, 'Hangzhou Youth Times', 'Daily Business Daily', 'Today Morning Post' published 'Olympic commemorative coins appeared in Hangzhou 'Beijing 2008 Olympic gold and silver commemorative coin collection, turned out, Hangzhou 50 sets of flowers fall?' Advertising, the issuer is Beijing Rui Sheng De Investment Consulting Co., Ltd., the issue address is the Hangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China newspaper 'Hangzhou Daily' news building. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu immediately bought a set of Olympic commemorative gold coins worth 1,080 yuan, but not long later, the Chinese Olympic Committee denied that it had authorized Beijing Rishid Investment Consultants Co., Ltd. to develop Olympic commemorative coins, and the China Gold Coin Corporation identified the 'Beijing 2008 Olympic Gold and Silver Commemorative Coin Collection' as a counterfeit product. After the impersonator got money, escaped, many cheated buyers so far have not recovered justice, Pan zhongyu Zhongyu really feels chilling! \\nIn response to Mao Zedong's call, Pan zhongyu Zhongyu gave opinions to the Party and helped the party to get the wind up. As a result, he scored the plan of 'Yang Mou' and spoil 22 years of youth! Pan zhongyu Zhongyu patriotic, usual hot days do not eat a dollar money a popsicle, but buy a set of counterfeit gold coins commemorative products with 1,080 yuan, bought a 'cheated'! Pan zhongyu Zhongyu does not know how to be a person! \\nOn May 12, 2008, Sichuan Wenchuan earthquake struck an 8-magnitude earthquake. It is a glorious tradition of the Chinese nation. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu's heart is moving again! However, how long he witnessed political corruption, corruption, bribery and bribery permeability, in order to prevent being deceived again, he donated a little in public to safeguard the face of those in power. If he encountered specific suffering, he would do his best to help one, just as he treated Xiaolu and treated people with disabilities! Pan zhongyu Zhongyu has become 'mature' and 'sophisticated' in 'cheated'! \\nTianmu dumb girl Xiaoping painted well, but she was eating very poor meals. I had no money to help, and I wanted to 'take the painting to change money' to improve her life. After learning, Pan zhongyu Zhongyu asked me to instruct the painting on his behalf. The picture is: early in the spring, the sun rises; a buffalo heading up Chaoyang Mai line, cattle rope tied on the horn, hanging a little bit on the horn; a shepherd sitting on the back of the cattle, dressed with patches, seriously reading books; several children wearing new clothes, carrying school bags alive in school On the avenue. The inscription is: No kind of phase, the boy should be self-reinforcing. \\nPan zhongyu Zhongyu stressed to me that the price of painting doubled, aimed at helping the handicap. I introduced the calligrapher Shen Minhua and he knew that soon after Pan zhongyu Zhongyu's house hanged his own written 'gold is treasure money, non-treasure, all things are empty' Shen Minhua calligraphy. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu's inscription is the deep heart of his painful childhood. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu's self-writing is his comment that he does not eat an ice in the hot summer, support others but throw at least two months of pension. Pan zhongyu Zhongyu insists on the truth, helpful spirit radiance, touching. \\nPAGE 9"}

This year he dealt with the death of the father of the eighteenth Riba Buddha, justice was done and the perpetrators were punished. Later personally presided over the bed ceremony of Riba Buddha at Songming Rock, which was widely praised by the national minorities in the territory. General Yu Wei was conferred in 1925. 1926 Feng Yuxiang National Army Liu Yufen Department entered Gansu. In June of that year, Liu to cite Zhao Xi was hired as a shou ambassador in Hezhou town, and called Pei Jian as Suzhou town In February 1929, he was commander of Ganliang. In the summer of the same year, the National Army Liu Yufen and Sun Lianzhong were transferred to Shaanxi to participate in the 'Central Plains War', Gansu military affairs emptiness, and local warlords fled. In April 1930, local gentlemen formed the provincial government headed by Wang Zhen, Zhang Wei, Yang Si, La Shijun, Zhao Yuanzhen and other eight members. Pei jianzhun is one of the members. In August 1931, Lei Zhongtian, director of the Lanzhou National Army, launched a coup d'état, detaining Ma Hongbin, the provincial chairman appointed by the National Government, and set up a provisional provincial government composed of 13 members headed by Ma Wenche. Pei jianzhun is also a member of the provincial defense commander, responsible for maintaining local security. After the 'Reimar Incident', the local political situation is increasingly eroding. The KMT forces gradually took control of Gansu, while the forces of various factions were intertwined, and the political scene was plagued. Pei jianzhun has a sense of turbidity, Yanyan confusion, people's heart changeover, has no power to save himself, but not willing to flow, decided to rush back, take the initiative to retreat from military and political positions. Since then, he worked with old friends Dunlon, Yang Hangong and others to the 'Goosan Society' where people from the Buddhist community gathered every day, and participated in the preparation of the provincial Buddhist Church as a governor. Then reject the common duties, the key is not out, every day to convert to the Buddha, only to write and draw entertaining. Although he also served as Senator of Lanzhou City in the 40s, provincial bank supervision, director and other positions, but most of them were idle vacant, and actually still lived 'Danqing has no knowledge of the old, rich than me like the cloud'. Pei jianzhun is an official, and shy, after leaving the official field to live a poor civilian life. For quite a long time, he had to rely on the sale of objects and collect meager calligraphy brushes as subsidies, and was very high among the citizens of Lanzhou. \\nAfter the establishment of the 'New China', Pei jianzhun actively participated in the activities of the United Nations War System, passionate about public welfare, and supported and publicized the Party's policies, especially religious policies. He has served as representatives of the first session of the people's congress of Gansu province, the first and second members of the CPPCC, Lanzhou Buddhist Association vice chairman. 1953 Participated in the Civil Revolution, standing member of the provincial committee. In October 1958, it was classified as 'right'. The 'Cultural Revolution' suffered a brutal struggle, physical and psychological devastation, and was discernible on December 14, 1969. Aged 85 years old. After the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Pei jianzhun obtained a complete rebellion, overturned all false and false words, and the social reputation was restored. \\nLady Deng Yulian, Word Xiangchi, Wei Yuanren. Born in the second second of December 1886 and died on April 11, 1969. Born in the home of reading, a little solution of poetry. The character is clear, soft and soft; the husband, let the work of grievances. Long service Pei old on the side of the pen inkstone, ears and dyeing, gradually able to understand the drawing, even narcissus, plum blossoms, unique wind gods, people or thought from the old hand of 'Cultural Revolution' in a lot of shock and humiliation, to eighteen-old old self-sustaining, dedicated care of Pei old diet living, in the heart of exhaustion before Mr. go. The eldest son of Guanghan, died in 1950. Jizi Guangduo, a famous cartoonist in Gansu province, is the director of the Gansu Daily, retired as the honorary chairman of the Provincial Comics Association. \\nDuring the period of Renhezhou town, Pei jianzhun was honest, considerate and promote a new culture. Founding 'civil-military school', open Chinese language, painting, music, gymnastics, national arts and other modern courses, Kaihe premier modern education. The new 'Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture Zhi•Character History' set up biography for Pei jianzhun, the narrative is more objective, especially the specific government of the eight-year town manned. The biography said that Pei old had eight words of 'doing justice for politics and integrity and understanding the people's feelings', while also mentioning his achievements in 'promoting a new culture' and establishing education in Hezhou. River state at the end of the Qing Dynasty, known for the war and disaster. After two major uprisings of the Hui ethnic group and the Qing Army to deal with the 'aftermath' by the Tongji and Guangxu, local vitality was seriously injured, the population was sharply reduced, the economy was lost and social conflicts deepened. Since ancient times, Hezhou is a complex place of ethnic and religious complexities. Whether or not to deal with this problem is always the key to the stable development of the local region. This is especially important in the early days of the early Qing people, when troubled and the country is in decline. According to local sources, from the first year of the Republic to six years, the total soldiers in Hezhou, from Lu Kuiyuan to Zhang Dingbang, have a total of five people, with an average term of only a little more than one year. This was related to the changing political situation at the time, and it was also an indication that the military and political leaders of River State were not doing well. Especially after the same governance, the ethnic divide deepened, the rise of local warlords and the stagnation of various forces, making the situation even more complicated. Pei jianzhun arrived in office, one thing was eight years, which was the only case at that time. He has no special background, he can't talk about any strong backstage, less military power than other town manners, how can he stay in his place for a long time? Local historian Mr. Wang Bingde once said: 'He (referring to Pei jianzhun), during his stay in Hezhou, paid attention to national unity, good at resolving all sides of the contradictions, and returning the Chinese people to live in peace and business, and have outstanding political voice.' Hezhou people called 'King Kong face, Buddha heart' to Pei jianzhun. An important way to resolve conflicts by Pei jianzhun is to give full play to the role of well-known local gentlemen. His attitude towards all ethnic groups is sincere and non-discriminatory, and many issues have been in extensive contact with these gentlemen with deep social foundations, soliciting opinions and consulting on ways to deal with them. In particular, the problem of the Islamic community, which he had struggled as a Han official, was more sincerely resolved through the head of Muslim figures. Ma Zhankui (Xingyuan), La Shijun (Xiu Shan), Ma Fu Chen (mining), Zhang Jian (quality students), Deng Long (German public), Xu Shaolie (Qinruo), etc., are regular visitors, some of his singing songs and brushes gift of poetry friends. Under his intentions to nourish, Hezhou's upper level society has appeared a strong human atmosphere, strong and courageous social atmosphere is also one change. In this regard, Mr. La Shijun has been summed up as a vivid postword: 'Pei Zhentai sitting in Hezhou-martial arts singing.' The so-called 'martial arts and literary singing' refers not only to Pei jianzhun's military status, but is he enthusiastically advocating literature and education, drawing on the culture of education Another article is not to take military power and not cultivate personal military strength. The reason why Pei jianzhun did so was to ease local burdens. Second, it could ease the antagonism and prevent feelings of confrontation between the people and nationalities, and played the role of 'negative self-dissipation'. At the same time, Pei jianzhun hopes the people will live in peace and well-being. Pei jianzhun actively develops local education. The new 'State Zhi' mentions that he founded a 'civil-military school', offering courses such as modern Chinese language, painting, music, gymnastics and national arts. In 1923, Pei jianzhun and local gentlemen Xu Shaolie, La Shijun, Lu Xiaozu, Ma Bingliang and other people initiative and donated, Daohe County Government allocated 2,000 yuan, created Daohe County junior high school. This is the beginning of Linxia's establishment of high school. \\nPei jianzhun remains concerned about the people and approachable style in the town of Suzhou, he has contacted many places, actively promote culture and education, and develop people's wisdom. He founded the weekly 'Wake Up' to promote democratic ideas. In order to curb the exploitation of farmers by the landlords of rich riches, 'agricultural workers loan facilities' have been launched to provide low-interest loans to farmers with official printed paper stamps in order to help farmers through difficult conditions. \\nIn February 1932, Pei jianzhun was stationed in Zhangye with the position of commander of Gan Liang garrison, and incorporated the remnants of the original town manners Ma Lin, compiled into the fifth brigade, personally as brigade captain. Pei jianzhun is moderate, military discipline, unity of local forces, quickly swept up the domestic bandits, and stopped Ma Zhongying's coveted heart of Zhangye, so that the people of Zhang Ye were determined and the rest of the industry. Modern long history family, to huanghuang giant 'Gan Qingning history' famous Mu Shouqi (Shaotang), has seven ancient 'General Wen Pei Mengwei from Jiuquan to Ganzhou' a first, discipline, and Mr. Mei Pei Deye. Poetry Cloud:\\nPei Gong corrects heroic posture, the angels will make the name Ganzhou West ancient Jiuquan, to sit in the town. Who forced Volbo abandoned Ganzhou, out of cage wild birds chirped. If it is not under the heavenly general, it shall be taken in the palm The fairness of the army rose, starry night fly to the Black River water. Jiancheng four Gu deployment strict, smell angry. Horseman Hugo West army, bad cloud crushing not open. Wait for the Lord, the thief enduring natural destruction. So it will not always have, Shougong grapes hundred bottles of wine. Displaced Hongyan successively returned, old friends are now? \\nPei jianzhun has the reputation of 'Confucian', Lin Rong's leisure, studied the history of 100 books and Buddhist books, and many exchanges with Longyou poetry artists. Can poetry, but not easily drop the pen, nor easily show people, so few of the works survived, after the 'Cultural Revolution' it will be more difficult to see. When garrison in Ganzhou, Mr. visited Qilianshan Linsong Valley Horseshoe Temple, there is a poem 'to Zhangye Huaihuai Guo Yu' poem, lucky Mr. Wang Bingde recorded, to see one of Mr. Poetry:\\nThe valley is a good twist, desperate. Dragon do not use Ji, Ming Zhe refuge. \\nAncient fire, Xiyin Guo chief. Self chiseled grottoes dwelling, view from many \\nTime to be alone and good, and act in every spirit. Mo mean no one, so with gas terms. \\nGein Daimiden, Kuiranliu Ancient Temple. The edge of the rot, there are visitors to. \\nThe ancient people moved me to think, Peng Ze Duoyat. Who stands high wind, the idea of Yuan Hui. \\nPei jianzhun likes paintings and calligraphy since childhood, finally came home with paintings, enjoy the name of Longshang, works cherished by intellectuals. \\nIn terms of calligraphy, he was a young man under the guidance of the school teacher, with Yan Zhenqing's 'Duo Pagoda', 'Family Temple' and 'Qin Li' monuments, slightly longer and wrote Yan's 'race for seat' and 'niphew' book posts, the basis can be said mainly Yan. But at that time, there were few Jiatuo, Yan words also wrote popular Taiwan-style posts. After taking office in Beijing, I saw many famous traces, and also had contact with a lot of books, eye-strength strength has advanced. Once liked the Qing people Wang Peng (boat), words, especially the list book. Later like Mifu (Nangong), especially like rice 'multi-view building', 'tiaoxi poetry' and other lines of book posts, once focused on the factions, unknown. In addition, they also write the bone, small seal and book, but hard not exclusively, to the place, even for it. Build book, line or grass, asana still more Yimi's. Gesture smooth, slightly unhindered, quite smart, landing and landing show the end of the thick book. His words are the most visible. In the early years Lanzhou merchant plaque amount is mostly from Mr. hand author, tend to be proud and gracious, Qing Jin Junyi see Yan's bone, and the pen body is not lack of clear rhyme. \\nPei Jian Zhun natural joy painting, life to draw as the biggest pleasure, although the saddle is not forgotten to paint, but there is free, easy paper sucking pen, little dyeing, music and forget. He is not a professional painter, but his love and interest in painting is no less than a professional painter. Pei old paintings do not have a special teacher, the early years mainly rely on their own search, by reading drawings and viewing the works. Later out of the official field, focus on this, often engage with Longshang painters. The most frequent contacts are Mr. Fan Zhenxu. In addition, local celebrities such as Chen Laiyun, Zhao Xiyan, Ding Xinong, Cao Longding, etc. In the early forties, Mr. Zhang Daqian travelled in Helong, and was also a guest of Pei old. Mr. Daqian had given to Pei Lao Guanyin, ladies and other works, all reportedly destroyed in the Cultural Revolution. However, on the way of painting and painting, the people who have the greatest influence on Pei old are to count Mr. Fan Zhenxu. In the three and forties of Longyuan painting and painting industry, Mr. Fan Zhenxu was a leader. Pei old to draw horses most famous. Maybe because long in the military, and growing in the northwest plateau, Tsushima has a special emotion, like horse watching, like horse riding and Somma, until you like painting horses. Pei old painting horse has three characteristics: first, a good painting alone horse and not big painting Gunma, Qiong Qiong Li, unfettered. Second, generally set color, rarely painted ink horse. Third, a good painting of quiet horse, not big painting dynamic horse. The most common composition is a separate horse, with sparrow grass stone, or with landscape, setting is more simple, light ink, a little business. Pei old painting horse is very focused on realism, from horses body ratio, category wool, or standing or lying posture, are quite accurate, quite Jun and Peugeot, very lang Shining taste. Pursuit point mainly in a 'static' word. Dead wood tree, horse independent, bone pure God, calm and quiet. In the absence of silence, implicitly revealed a kind of faraway interest. The repeated portrayal of this subject and the realm may have to do with Pei's old rapid-back, even though he lived a deep and simple quiet life, but finally can not forget about the state of the nation's national mood. \\nPei jianzhun left a large number of paintings and calligraphy works in his life. After the 'Cultural Revolution' disaster, the home has disappeared. Granddaughter Pei Shutuo for Mr. Pei Lao prepared a collection of paintings and paintings, with her husband exhausted his money, running to search in counties and towns in various parts of the province, all heard, not far from visiting. Carefully search for sources, identify authenticity, years of hard work, actually collected dozens of calligraphy and calligraphy, it is really a blessing for the cultural community in Longshang. \\nTo report the deeds of Mr. Pei jianzhun, see only local Chi, Ma Mingda-commemorating the 115th anniversary of the birth and death of Mr. Pei jianzhun and 25th anniversary of the death of Mr. Pei jianzhun, 'This wish to paint in the cast, the lifelike escape' and Zhao Zhiyuan's poetry Pei jianzhun, Pei jianzhun, and Pei jianzhun paintings. \\nSummarize Mr. Pei jianzhun's legendary life, the author praise: half living rong horse only for the people, dirty pool does not leave the official. Alone to Zen from calligraphy, but seek peace to be mountain people. \\n"},

In order to survive, he needs to pick more than a dozen water from the Yellow River, a kilometer away from the Yellow River one kilometer away, in order to prepare a lot of water for the production of bean sprouts.

Suddenly, he was caught by someone from the back: 'What are you doing?' Looking back, he was caught by an adult, after he was taken to a hall. \\nThere is an old man in the hall, wearing a long shirt, in a solemn look. Zonghua stealing eyes, yeah!

At that time, often when Pei was painting, he was watching, progressing, and keeping in mind a move, and practice as soon as there was idle. In a few years after liberation, every New Year, he drew a lot of window pictures, presented to his relatives and friends. In this case, he also impressed his relatives and friends with a 'little painter'. \\n'My relationship with Pei went on until 1958. Because that year, I just went to Shanghai to study, remember that Pei wrote 'hard to study, work hard' on my notebook and covered his book mark. But did not think that I went, turned out to be a farewell...'\\nBecause of the old times, today we through Mr. Zong Xue's memories, we can only understand the situation of Pei Garden, and through the 'Lanzhou Garden Chi', we can see the panorama of Pei Garden: Pei Yuan in the north of Wuquan Mountain Gate, built in 1929. Composed of two parts: East in the east of Wuquan Mountain Gate on the east side of the highland, west on the west side of the wuquan mountain gate flat ground, between the north and south to the road, covers an area of about 6,667 square meters.

I need to shoot Yang Huisheng with a gun. (panel presentation on 5 June)\\nII. Perspectives on Communist Party Organizations and Members\\n1. verbally speaking to intellectuals like love eye beads, this is simply hanging sheep head selling dog meat, simply not like words.

A room at the Beijing branch has five directors and three rehabilitation cadres. It really doesn't understand. (panel presentation on 10 June)\\n3. When the design institute evaluates wages, it is not the salary that it falls, the salaries of the ordinary people fall down, the director of department or section chief have not lost their wages. The masses are suffering in the front and enjoy the aftermath. (panel presentation on 5 June)\\n4. The reason for the poor relationship between the party group is that the masses look at another eye, they are comrades verbally, and ideologically do not have relations at all, and see the masses as eating and taking money. Party members made mistakes, and did not let the masses know that internal solutions, the masses had mistakes, they came up and attacked in a group. (Panel presentation on 27 May)\\n5.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】Li Zunran: Old Pei rende\\nIn the spring of 1993, after I received the notice of going to Beijing to attend the Alumni Association, I am happy, there is a special expectation deep in my heart: perhaps, I can finally cry with the old Pei rende, who has no news for nearly 40 years. So my thoughts flew back to that distant age. \\nIn the autumn of 1950, I was wearing a thick cloth pants, wrapped in my back, walking to Qingzhou Middle School to study. The same table is also a boy from the countryside, with wisdom and humor in his eyes, he is the old Pei rende. His name is Pei rende Rende, simple, smart, in the class is very human; but he eat, the wind and the clouds, gobble, so the stomach is bad, fart, and often jokes with classmates. On one occasion, he actually declared himself to run a 'fart school' and posted the admissions brochures. The class director looked for a message saying that he wanted to visit 'the head of the fart school', he took the initiative to find the class supervisor for self-examination. Things are over, but he has since left an indecent gag. \\nIn 1953, we went to Beijing to study together, we still study life in one class. Not only does he have excellent academic performance, but also sports, and his medium dash speed has been ranked at the top of the school. At the Games, people are always willing to refuel his 400 meters, looking at his chest tilting, two elbows, remembering his fart features, people will always shout loudly, 'Jet-style', cheer! Pei rende Rende, come on!' So, he added a nickname for 'jet'. \\nIn 1955, when we graduated, he stayed in the capital for further education; I was assigned to Guangzhou, and then I went to Nanjing to enter the military school. Although not living in a city, there is a constant correspondence. \\nIn the surprisingly cold winter of 1957, a campaign to 'counterattack the bourgeois right attacks' was raging at the university. I suddenly received a long letter from Old Pei rende, telling me a funny and sad story: one day, a university's conference room was full of people attending the meeting, old Pei rende swung into the venue, but suddenly put a fart loudly, so people laughed; in order to understand mockery, he used the mouth of humor Seriously, 'The October revolution sounded a gun that came to Marxism Leninism.' The people who were present first laughed, followed by shocking, silence, then talking, and then, later, some began to express indignation and protest. The next is to report criticism and criticism, which is to look for three generations and organize materials. Although his family is an authentic poor farmer, it is said that after entering the city, it is said to have deformed and deteriorated, finally logically put on the hat of the 'bourgeois right-wing'. Soon, I was also confused as a 'right' because I was a student of Zhang Bojun and sent back to the countryside far from the mountains and high emperors for transformations, and since then lost contact with old Pei rende. \\nAfter implementing the policy, I asked many people about old Pei rende, but there was no result. Therefore, there is more expectation of this classmates gathering. I imagine the old Pei rende doll face written full of spirit and humor, perhaps has been carved in the vicissitudes of years; I imagine the situation after we meet, after the big joy of people, there will no longer be the manic of dance, but does not rule out the loss of tears exchange. However, old Pei rende was not present, and I was completely disappointed-but from an alumni with him, I learned a lot about Old Pei rende. In that year, he was classified as the far right and sent to Inner Mongolia to build a highway. The specific job was to shoot eyes and put artillery and quarrying stones. It was a heavy and dangerous life, and what left him more unbearable was the discrimination and abuse of managers. A year later, he had a car accident on his way to transport stones and turned into a lame. In 1960, his family was informed that he was taken back to his hometown. His original fiancée has long been away from him, and at the moment a lame 'right', who will look? There was no way, with the intervention of her parents, married a girl with less nervous health, who later gave birth to a mentally handicapped son\\nIn 1978, he was placed to work at the County Highway Bureau, but soon returned home to care for disease because of cerebral thrombosis, the situation was very desolate. \\nReturning from Beijing, I was in a heavy mood and bloodshed in my heart. I rushed about Wen Jun bumpy to a remote village to visit old Pei rende, hurry, anxious, in the confused road, experienced many waves, finally entered a very shabby farm yard. We pulled our heart open the door, see in the corner of a big kang, exposed under the quilt, lying down a person, face miserable, hair like a weeds, two eyes full of doubt; that is the old Pei rende I thought that day and night; he finally recognized me, stretched out the right arm, I Hands hurry to hold the skinny hand, and tears fall. \\nFrom his vague narrative, I know that cerebral thrombosis not only restricts his movement, but also almost deprives him of the power to speak. His husband and wife and his stupid son's family barely spend the day on that poor salary. Thanks to the government and the leadership of the former unit, he often visited him, reimbursed most of the cost of medicine and provided relief from time to time. Otherwise, it might be premature to become a Buddha. \\nIn the evening, I and Lao Wen set a heavy mood on the way back; my heart was not happy because I met my old friends, but rather stuffed with lead blocks, heavy to be breathable. I am thinking that, although no political party can be as bright as the Communist Party of China, dare to admit mistakes and correct mistakes, our party is indeed great. But what is more important is to take the lessons and not make the same mistakes; because the implementation of policies can only give a limited relief in the mind, but it will never be able to save the changed destiny!!"}

Therefore, many of the comrades concerned about the work of the Ya'an region after liberation are reluctant to talk about the work of the NLD in Ya'an region, much less dared to talk realistically, afraid to cause misunderstandings and fear that they are 'reversing the case.' I also try to avoid touching, think it's a no-go zone, let some people criticize, really like a dumb eat even. After liberation, for a period of time because the truth is unclear, unclear and indiscriminate, many comrades have suffered grievances. For example, Wang Dequan and Zhu Shizeng were sentenced to prison terms. \\nIn 1957, a group of allied members, such as Pan Dakui, Zhang Zhihe, Fan Puzhai, Zhang Songtao, Luo Xiling, Yang Huichuan, Zhang Declaration and others, were classified as right-wing elements in Sichuan. Pan Dakui was designated as the head of the 'Zhangluo Union' Sichuan branch. The underground armed forces carried out by the XKang NLD are believed to be a riot and riot armed by the anti-revolutionary landlords directed by Zhang Bojun. Not only did it take credit, but even confused the anti-Jiang armed forces we engaged in with banditry riots across Chuankang after liberation, resulting in some comrades 'files containing unfactual material and wrong conclusions. \\nAs noted in the file of Allied Wu Guozhi (Director of the Provincial Business Cadre School), 'In October 1949, China's Democratic League organization sent to Xingjing County, Xikang Province to participate in the activities of banditry organized by Zhang Zhihe, headed by Zhang Zhihe, to engage in so-called peripheral organizations of the NLD in Minsheng Primary School. Friends 'work, and then participated in the banditry forces organized by Pendi The military civil society, led by the Department of Political Affairs, carried out condolences to the banditry forces around Xingjing.' These comrades have been subjected to prolonged injustice and, in turn, persecution. Three people were imprisoned, wrongly killed and forced to commit suicide. This error occurred in Xingjing, but it involves far beyond the boundaries of Xingjing County, beyond Ya'an an area, not only provincial units in the province and Chengdu, Liangshan, Ganzi, Zigong and other places, but also some comrades working in Beijing, Shanghai, Anhui, Henan, Shanxi and other places; not only A large number of NLD comrades also involve clandestine party comrades, and progressive figures from other organizations are also heavily affected. This mistake has lasted for more than 30 years, involving many cadres and long grievances, which are rare in the history of democratic parties. \\nOn October 7, 1981, when Zhang Songtao met Zhang Youyu at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing to report to him about the NLD's underground armed struggle in Xikang, Zhang Lao said: 'Originally I also did Liu Wenhui's work. You engaged in an armed struggle to fight Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Lingji. What is wrong?' Zhang also asked: 'How will these armed forces be dealt with in the future?' Zhang Songtao replied: 'The PLA is fully demobilized upon arrival.' Zhang Lao said, 'That's good!' \\nNow it has been confirmed that Zhang Bojun has nothing to do with the underground armed forces of the Xikang NLD. The right-wing issue of Pan Dakui, Zhang Zhihe, Fan Puzhai, Zhang Songtao and others is a miscalculation and has been corrected successively. Zhang Zhihe's ashes were placed at the Baoshan Revolution Cemetery in Beijing in February 1981. Zhu Shizheng was reviewed by the Supreme People's Court in April 1980 and quashed the sentence; Wang Dequan in November 1981, reviewed by the Sichuan High People's Court, quashed the sentence. Zhu and Wang Jun have resumed treatment of insurgent soldiers and made political arrangements. \\nOn the eve of liberation, I was the chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Xikang branch of the NLD. I have a better understanding of the situation of fighting and organizing armed forces in the XKang NLD underground. However, because of the interference of the route of the past 'left', many comrades mistakenly handled, I was also implicated, did not raise it.. After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, corrected the past 'left' wrong lines, re-established the correct political and organizational lines, proposed a set of policy measures to reverse and rectify a large number of wrongs and wrongs, dealt with many historical legacy issues, so that mistakes were corrected and wronged cases were corrected. To flatter snow. \\nThe Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has carefully implemented the line of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party, and attaches great importance to the NLD activities in Xikang on the eve of liberation. After investigation, on December 20, 1983, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), No. 51 document was formed, i.e., the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee on Ya'an to the Xingjing County Committee About 'Zhang Zhihe led Xingying in collusion with landlords and bandits Organize the review report of the nature of the armed forces 'request report'. On the afternoon of February 13, 1984, in the meeting room 701 of the Jinjiang Hotel, the Vice Minister of the United Front Department of Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), but Hanran deputy minister conveyed the Provincial Committee's document No. 51 at the meeting, on behalf of the United Front Department, he clearly stated on behalf of the United Front Department: 'This case is a wrong case. Make a complaint of course, and the Provincial Committee treats this complaint in the same way as other cases of wrongs and wrongs Similarly, attach great importance to it and treat it as a major case, and charged the Provincial Committee Organization Department and the United Front Front Department, together with the Public Security Department, the courts, the Ya'an Local Committee and Xingjing County, to carry out several studies and consult repeatedly. On the basis of a large number of investigation and research work, the Xingjing County Committee wrote a review report to the Ya'an Land Committee, and the Commission agreed to transmit it to the provincial committee, and finally formed the Provincial Committee \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), No. 51 document. As far as I know, it is not very common for the provincial committee to issue special documents for a particular case, especially in relation to the work of the United Front, this is still the first time. This is a victory for the line, policy and policy of the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the 11th Central Committee. It is the victory of the Party's policy of rebelling the wrong cases, and the victory of the party's united war policy!' But when Vice Minister Han Ran said here, I was very moved, tears and sincerely grateful to the Party. The original excerpt from Sichuan Provincial Committee of CPC \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), No. 51:\\nOn the eve of liberation, the NLD underground organization, in order to meet the liberation of Xikang, with the support and participation of the Communist Party of the Communist Party of the Communist Party, sent Allied Comrades Zhang Zhihe and Peng dixian to be responsible for the uprising of Zhu Shizheng, captain of the Kuomintang Security Command, Ya Yinghan Joint Defense Corps in Saikang Province, and did useful work to the people after the uprismade. However, after liberation, they were not treated as insurgents in accordance with the party's policy, so that some of them were prosecuted and wrongly dealt with in the past movements for historical issues. After the anti-right struggle in 1957, the insurgent force was mistakenly designated as 'led by Zhang Zhihe who collaborated with landlords and bandits' Insurgent armed groups of banditry nature, and decided that 'all persons above the squadron captain shall be punished with bandits'. This confuses history's success, so that a large number of NLD members, clandestine members and other non-party progressionists involved in the anti-intifada work have been affected by the chain. This is a wrong case, and the Provincial Committee agreed to repudiate it. \\nThe conclusions reached by the 1958 Communist Party of China's Xingjing County Committee, the five-member group of the Ya'an Land Committee and the five-member group of the provincial committee on the nature of this force were withdrawn. Comrades inside and outside the party who have been affected by this in the past have to be remedied. Officials and soldiers participating in the intifada, except for those who have actually participated in the rebellion or other ongoing counter-revolutionary sabotage activities after the intifada, should be treated as intifada personnel, implement the Party's policy and properly resolve the remaining issues. In carrying out countermeasures and implementing policy work, it is important to do a good job of political thought among the local masses, publicize the Party's policy of 'never blame' against the people who surrender to the uprising, and avoid causing misunderstandings. \\nAfter the document was issued, after a period of work, the Sichuan Daily reported the concise situation of the wrong case in the first edition of July 27, 1984, under the title of 'Serious Investigation and Research, Restoration of the True Facts of History-A Great Wrong Case of the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee against the Sichuan NLD', so as to bring the facts to the truth. Yu Zhong, clarifies and corrects misconceptions, restored the original face of history , it is clear that many comrades (including me), have been wronged for a long time, this to the comrades and friends who have fought with me in the past have an account, put down the burden, Shan to suffer the historical dust. The grievances of comrades killed by persecution can also laugh Jiuquan, and their families are also protected from social salience. As the chairman of the Xikang Branch Preparatory Committee on the eve of liberation, I also got some relief from my feelings of guilt, and I was slower in my heart. \\nThe anti-Jiang armed struggle carried out by the NLD in Xingying and other places is inseparable from the underground work led by the Sichuan Branch Committee of the NLD. With the leadership, support and cooperation of the Communist Party of China, comrades of the provincial NLD paid a huge price to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's rule and meet liberation. According to statistics from the NLD Central Committee, more than 90 martyrs have died in the struggle for the democratic revolution, 51 in Sichuan including Xikang, or 52.2 per cent. Many of these killed martyrs were comrades across the party alliance. \\nDuring the difficult days of the Xikang region organized anti-Jiang armed forces to meet the liberation struggle, the NLD and many comrades of the underground party and the 'People's Association' forged a deep fighting friendship, and everyone had a common goal: 'To defeat Chiang Kai-shek and build a new China.' Mutual support and cooperation, common confrontation, intimate, regardless of each other, hard to taste, wind and rain. If you do the 'Guangming Shun Post', it is an underground party member Yang Zhengnan and I jointly responsible, working together to edit and publish, without suffering. Also like catching alive Yu Zhongchi, the chief agent of the Central Committee in Xikang Province, initially learned that Yu was going to escape, was the underground party member Hong Zhong informed me. Many clandestine party members also suffered from the grievances suffered by the NLD in Xingying's wrong case. \\nLooking back at our history of this revolutionary struggle, the fighting friendship between the NLD and the Communist Party, 'the wind and rain, together with honor and disgrace', is very memorable. As in December 1983, in a message from the CPC Central Committee to the Fifth National Congress of the China Democratic League, read out by Comrade Xi Zhongxun, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Central Committee of the Central Committee of the Central Committee of the Central Committee, said: 'The Chinese Democratic League has long fought alongside us and is a close comrade of the Party and has the light of a patriotic revolution. Vinh History.' The anti-Jiang struggle we organized in Xingying and other places is an example of 'wind and rain, fighting side by side'. \\n(The author is the second, third and fourth chairman of the NLD Sichuan Province, former deputy director of the Provincial People's Congress)"}

A Kang Feng. Hunan province Xiangxiang (now Shuangfeng), County people (1952 administrative division change, Xixiang County Zhishuangfeng County). Born from poor, rarely rely on selling labor, near the hometown of snake town coal mine pick coal, hard work and thrift, to make a difference. He served as a journalist in primary school and newspaper. After entering the national government to find jobs, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, he did a lot of useful work for the establishment of the new China. (The historical documentation of the Hunan Provincial Working Committee of the Communist Party of China (in the period of liberation war), page 263, published in 2005), after liberation, was appointed as a member of the Hunan Provincial People's Government. \\nFather was born straight, evil as vengeance. After being elected as the first and second people's deputies of Changsha City, it was even more favored to speak the truth and dare to speak the truth without consequences. In 1957, he was guilty of words. According to a speech he made at the NPC session, the father was classified as a bourgeois right. For refusing to confess 'guilt', it was treated as 'extreme right': dismissal from public office, dismissal from dry nationality, and control by neighborhood committees of street offices. In this way, the father had to take the weak body of his destiny year, to engage in the heavy physical labor of soil, push the cart, hammer stone, in exchange for meager resources, hardship day. \\nAfter the friend introduced, the father turned to write oil-printed handouts for college and college to earn a living. The reward at that time is to write an 8 open waxed paper at every moment, and receive four dime money. Under the double pressure of both mental and material, the father waved down seven and two 'lettering' reading heart-reading:\\nThe past word worth a thousand gold, thousands of words is difficult to change a gold. \\nCook words for survival begging, reading mistakenly me to life. \\nYou\\nDifficult livelihood carving worms, twilight toward pen-commission. \\nWenhe when the dust is broken, iron cone Fu resting and sighing. \\nHere the father issued a lament that 'reading mistakes me to life'. He thinks that without reading a book, he will not be guilty of words without whistling, he would not 'have been a shout guest, now a crackdown', he would not 'not be abandoned, sick and sick', and would not 'cove the bleak night, dipped in the face of the dynasty'. This is the inner monologue of Monologically, a cluttered intellectualist under political and economic pressure. \\nIt should be said that the heart of the father is contradictory. He still wants to contribute to the country, and does not think that his opinion is wrong, but suffers from the inability of people to understand and find knowledge. This can be seen from some of his verses: 'The flowing mountains who disenfranchise, the subphase goes after the string. Qu Yuan has not flattened the life, Jia Fu Konghuai state heart. It is difficult to determine why ruined reputation must be considered deep'. 'Although the shape remains old, the heart is still alive.' 'Huang Zhong is a long abandonment, the kettle can only be short-lived. In the theory of guilt and fall, the end does not cover the senseless.' 'Why should I ask about the mundane things,Geng's heart only self-pity。 \\nIn April 1965, the father, who became ill, was found to have lung cancer, but had no money to treat it. Drag to January 1967, finally in the rising wave of Cultural Revolution, after the red guard's house (mother's office, sister's factory and living street office neighborhood committee), three times, in the paralyzed bed he dragged him to the outdoor listed tour street show, died in anger and death. At 58 years old. \\nThank you for the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee. September 10, 1979, the United Front Work Department of Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CCP), issued a letter to correct the father's right. Its Xiangtong Herringbone \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), No. 78 said: 'Peng e is classified as right-wing elements is a misrepresentation and should be corrected. Rescind the decision of the former right-wing elements to restore political honor.' (See Appendix 1 after the book). \\nSome of the poems, words, federations, and wendo written by his father were found in newspapers, notes, diaries and letters. Based on the manuscript and some of the materials collected as much as possible, as well as some memories of my childhood, I have compiled them and edited them into a book for commemoration. \\nManuscripts are organized in chronological order and are divided into three parts: pre-liberation works, post-liberation works and appendices. In view of the absence of a specific writing year for each work, the editors fill in parentheses according to the historical speculation for the reader's reference. Notes are also written by the editor. \\nThe manuscript has a lot of grass, traditional, alien or ancient and present words, some are incomplete or ambiguous. Some dictionaries are available, but are not collected on the computer. So it's very difficult to organize. In addition, I have retired, but still part-time to support my family. As a result, time and effort are very limited. In the case of old age, there are also many difficulties in starting computer studies. When I beat my father's manuscript slowly one word by word on my computer keyboard, it was a lot of difficulty, a lot of emotions! In addition, his own national studies are not at the very roots of their fathers. Therefore, their fallacy is inevitable. Pray for the party's family to teach. \\nThis year coincides with the 40th anniversary of the death of his father and misdesignation as the 50th anniversary of the right-wing. Today is just another day of death for the father. With this book dedicated to the Spirit of Heaven. \\nPeng Guoan Jing\\nOn January 26, 2007, under the foot of the mountain of the Xiangshui Coast\\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attachment 2] Peng Guoan: 'Postscript of Pengye Poetry Selection' \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\)\\nThis father's legacy, 'Pengye Says Selection', has made a small number of copies in printed form to seek the views of family and friends, and received the advice of many elders and friends, which has benefited me a lot. In particular, Mr. Tao Liangjin, chief engineer of Xingtai Metallurgical Machinery Rolling Factory of the sixth and seventh sessions of the CPPCC Provincial Committee and the former Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, Mr. Tao Liangjin, with his rich life experience and deep literary literacy, through letters and emails, put forward many pertinent opinions and suggestions to the text. Its text, moving! I would like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt thanks to all the teachers and relatives who care and support the publication of father's poetry. \\nWhen the father refers to some people, places and things in poetry, the reason why he uses the word 'certain' or 'certain' instead of the word 'certain' or 'certain', according to the father himself, is that he does not want to connect others with his own 'sins', thus leaving a word for those with 'far left' ideas. For example, under extremely difficult conditions at the time, those who were willing to help his father or accompany him outdoors were generally 'right' friends or sympathetic friends of the 'right'. And they sang each other and have fun in their bitterness, and be one of the sorrow of sorrow. But the father also fears that there will be titles such as 'right-wing party' or 'small group.' In 1957, when he was criticized, the father had lamented 'what to do with sin'. Of course, this spring and autumn pen also leaves a lot of mystery for us who read poetry. Fortunately, history is like this, so leave these mystery to history! \\nAs for the meaning of the father's name 'cx', I think it has to do with the idea of being human beings throughout his life. 'Calyx' is the abbreviation of 'calyx', with flowers, and has the role of protecting petals. (Flowers consist of petals, calyx, flower support, pistil.), The ancients often used 'calyx' metaphor 'brothers love', also as 'Hua e'. 'Poems, small ya, Changdi': 'Chang Di Zhi Hua, not Wei Wei, all today's people, Mo as brothers.' These four sentences mean: 'Tong Dei flower smiley Ying Ying, calyx foot is the same root, try the people in the world today, who can have brothers like that.' (Changdi: namely Tong Pear Tree. Eh: with 'Cal'. No: Petty. Wei: wěi: bright; meisheng; bright appearance.), 'New Tang Book, Li Ye Chuan' (qe: yì: governance; stability): 'Qe brothers, Shang Zhen, filial Shen Shen Shen, in addition to their own name, brothers as one episode, No. Li's Calyx set.' In fact, the father's care of his brother and nephew throughout his life, and the generous financial assistance, is a reputation among folks and friends. Some of our immediate family members seem to have a little word about this. \\nPhilanthropist line, my elders read it! His father completed his troubled life, leaving behind these poems that truly reflect the rugged journey of his life, and a true record of the journey of a generation of intellectuals. Cha jinyi known past, never before today. Personnel have metabolism, exchanges into ancient and present. May we cherish the present life, learn hard, work hard, be worthy of our ancestors, to be worthy of our descendants, to be worthy of our descendants! \\nis for the bare"}

In his activities, the defendant actively offered advice to Zhou Ju, the first prisoner, and the name of the 'China Marxists' Alliance' should be renamed the 'Marxist-Leninist Union of the Communist Party of China'. Because the Communist Party of China still had some prestige and actively spread the program and route of the anti-revolutionary organization, in early May 62, he received Liao Liangkang, a member of the 'China Marxists' Union' by the defendant in early May 62. Liao's first offender studied and announced his appointment to Liao as' 'Secretary General of Rongxian League Committee', later the defendant heard that Liao wants to clean back, and put a counter-revolutionary organizational platform drafted by Zhou and transferred Liao to Peng fuzhi Shiyun (co-offender), and arranged to Liao, 'Do not do development work in the early stages after going back, it needs to be very good.

The meeting was held in a hurry after the Guangzhou Daily revealed the fact that the head of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Branch of the Jiusan Society was not moving in the fight against the right. \\nAccording to the Guangzhou Daily on the 8th, the problem of the Guangzhou Branch of Jiusan Society is serious. After the establishment of this branch committee in November last year, due to the implementation of the vicious 'big development' policy, in just half a year by May this year, the branch members grew from four to 142 people, many of whom were politically unclear, complicated history and reactionary people. According to information already revealed by some grass-roots organizations, 20 per cent of the members are right-wing. Of the ten grass-roots organizations in the branch, two have become completely anti-socialist small groups; seven are partially heads or members of the right-wing. A number of right-wing elements have also been found in the leadership of the Branch Preparatory Committee. Peng guangqin, deputy chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Branch and Deputy Director of the South China Tropical Crop Research Institute, not only actively recruit troops at the Tropical Crop Research Institute, trying to usurp the scientific and technological leadership of the Institute, but also personally planned and incite the masses to attack the Communist Party and to change the joint meeting of the democratic party members of the Institute. Become a meeting to attack and slander the Communist Party. Nanhai Aquatic Company engineers Li Keji and Fu Shangzhi joined the Jiusan School, using deception and leaning and other means to pull up a group of people dissatisfied with the Communist Party to join the Jiusan School. They developed 11 members in two months, among them embezzled elements who had been sentenced to imprisonment, and some of them had participated in secret service organizations in history. People and landlords bullies, the backbone of the reactionary group. Li Keji summoned these people together for a secret meeting during the Great Ming, attacking the Communist Party, turning the whole organization into a small anti-Communist anti-socialist group. \\nHowever, in the past three months since Guangzhou has launched anti-right struggle, the Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Branch of the Jiusan Society has not held a meeting to expose and criticize the right elements within the organization. Even when Peng guangqin's deputy chairman of the branch preparatory committee was revealed by staff of the Tropical Crops Research Institute staff, the head of the Preparatory Committee of the Jiusan Branch also obstructed the Tropical Crop Research Institute, asking the head of the CPC Committee in this institute to be 'cautious' about Peng guangqin. Because the main head of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Branch of the Jiusan Society sympathized with and sheltered the right-wing elements, anti-right struggle by grass-roots organizations of the Jiusan Society also did not actively carry out. \\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attachment 2] Guan Qin: Peng guangqin Two and Three Things\\nProfessor Peng guangqin, one of the early post-liberation intellectuals who took the lead at the intellectuals symposium in 1952, said that although he was a book of Shangmen and studied rich in five cars, he was mostly feudal and bourgeoisie, so he had to learn again to realize the ideological revolution. Professor Peng was originally the director of Chongqing Industrial Test Institute, has research on rubber in India, and professor at the first level. \\nIn early 1953, because of the development needs of natural rubber business, obey national arrangements, led a group of experts and employees to Guangzhou Shamian South China Special Forestry Research Institute to prepare, serve as deputy chairman of the preparatory committee. \\nIn March 1954, the Institute was established as deputy director and director of the chemical industry department. Prof. Peng guangqin has deep academic skills, broad knowledge and active thinking, so he is valued by the leadership and embraced by all parties. Before 1957, Professor Peng also served as deputy secretary general of the Guangdong CPPCC, and the head committee of the Jiusan Society of Guangdong Province and other important social positions. \\nProfessor Peng guangqin, although he is in a high position, is amiable and approachable. When I was in Nanxiu Village, I worked as the Trade Union Sports Department, and often had the opportunity to work with Tang Dynasty to engage in cultural and sports activities for employees. Tang said he was a regular guest of Peng's family. He was very familiar with Peng's family. He was tired and could even lie in Peng's bed. Tang and Peng are very familiar, of course, on the one hand, but this also shows that Director Peng is easy to get close and do not put a shelf, do not count people. As for those who say that he does not respect the Soviet experts, in fact, it is nothing more than saying that he has nothing to do with the Soviet experts. Moreover, Soviet experts had only been exposed to rubber grass and other gum producing plants. Before coming to China, they had not even seen rubber trees. They were asked to guide the Chinese people in planting rubber trees, and it was inevitable that Chinese experts and scholars would be somewhat discouraged. Moreover, Professor Peng received his PhD in 1933 and was an expert in the study of wild natural rubber in China, while the Soviet Union sent experts were only an associate Ph.D., of course, without having to go to him. \\nUnfortunately, in the 1957 anti-right movement, Peng guangqin was misclassified as the right, removed from all positions and reduced to level 3 professors. In March 1958, together with you moved down to Danxian County, Hainan. We lived at the Lianchang test station, and he was arranged to work in our physiological anatomy group. Since then, the opportunities for my contacts with Professor Peng have started to grow up. At that time, it coincided with the holding of three red flags on the main route, the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune, militia exercises were carried out every day. At that time, Liu Zubang and I were both deputy captain of the United Chang team and the militia platoon. Early in the morning, Professor Peng joined us '1, 2, 1\\, never absent and late. \\nLater, Soli agreed that Professor Peng worked while doing some scientific research. Prof Peng therefore proposed a study on the use of Chinese medicine to smear the rubber tree cutting surface to stimulate increased production. When he started the arrangement experiment, I had to accompany Professor Peng, and went to Malaoshan in Lianchang with a glue cutter to select trees and numbering the tree and numbering experiment. He conducted more than 10 kinds of Chinese medicine formulations, if effective, is of great scientific significance. Alternative medicines can also be found at the time of promotion. I admire his broad thinking and rich scientific association. \\nGiven that this study is close to the 2,4,5-T chemical stimulus that I and Mr. Zhu Xianjin are doing, the leadership arranged for me to be an assistant to Peng at the same time. I and a glue worker, accompany him every day. In 1959, when the research building was completed, we moved back to our headquarters from Lianchang. Prof Peng hung a thermos every day to work, soak a cup of tea, and then return to the library a bunch of foreign literature; he looked at foreign language materials, always on his legs, sat for half a day, while smoking, reading books and writing his articles. After looking at these books and magazines, he wrote 'Gum Production Physiology of Rubber Trees'. \\nIn 1960, the Institute prepared to translate the Malaysian Rubber Cultivation Manual. Professor Peng was honoured to chair the translation and participate in the proofreading work. I was about to relocate to the college and saw Professor Peng assigning translation tasks to the people of the physiological anatomy group, translating the chapters into individuals. He then teaches you how to translate and dictate Chinese content chapter by chapter. The articles translated by each person were returned to Professor Peng for proofreading. At that time, most of the people in the physiology group participated in the translation. \\nIn 1962, the College was tasked to run a postgraduate course for Vietnamese students Phan Duc Peng, including Professor Peng's 'Physiology of Gum Cutting and Cutting'. \\nIn 1978, Beijing held a national scientific conference. It was at this time that Comrade Si Peng came to the workstation and asked me to convey the views of the hospital to Professor Peng guangqin and Lu Da-jing: the hospital agreed to their retirement requirements and asked them to write a written request. Because before that, I conveyed Professor Lu Dajing's request to retire to both houses. I didn't expect two days after the message, Mrs. Peng Wu Xiang went to the workstation to find me, saying that the scientific conference had just opened and the spring of science came, but you wanted Mr. Peng to retire, which was not in line with the situation. I heard and felt reasonable, that she told the hospital about her opinion... Peng guangqin had a stroke, but the wisdom recognized me, but the words were not clear, so everything about him was left to Wu Xiang. \\nAfter the National Science Congress, Prof Peng was appointed Deputy Director of Guangdong Museum of Culture and History, while Professor Lu Da-jing was appointed deputy director of Guangdong Institute of Microbiology. \\nIn January 1985, the two houses held a grand gathering of Guangzhou alumni for the first time. At the time of the establishment of the Institute, comrade Lin Xi, who was reassigned as deputy mayor of Guangzhou, also attended the meeting. The leaders of the old two houses such as Zhong Junlin, Xiao Gongji Attendees were very popular, with a total of 2,300 people. Professor Peng guangqin, accompanied by Mrs. Wu Xiang, was also pleased to attend the party and took a photo with you. 2007.7.28\\nPAGE 4"}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】Peng haijun: Introduction to Peng haijun (manuscript)\\nPeng Hae-jun joined the revolution in April 1950 in order to follow the Communist Party to overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorship, practicing democratic freedom and risking his life. In order to establish a new regime, participate in the new Government's food collection and lead the PLA in the fight against bandits. \\nFrom the end of 1954 to 1956 as the secretary of the county party, in early 1957, the county delegation was elected as the Standing Committee Committee. In 1957, next year County Committee Secretary Jia Hongbin changed my position in order to meet the requirements of the new Huan, and delegated me to work exercise in Xiaodong Township in Pu'er District. In early 1958, I married a rural youth Hu Rong for five days, wearing the safflower of decentralized cadres to the Zhenxiong Liuping farm for labor exercise. However, by June, the farm leader suddenly declared that 'Peng had anti-socialist rhetoric against the party in the wind.' So I carried out daytime overload labor, slag dug, rake the field. In the evening, the organization criticized me, tied, beaten, kneeling, not letting sleep, stipulating that night to write a confession, pursue recognition of the opposition, oppose learning from the Soviet Union, and undermine the international communist movement. I can't say anything but to state my reservations. After a month toss, physically and mentally destroyed, boiled to July: the farm held a conference, announced that Zhaotong Land Committee ordered me to put on the right hat to put on the Wiliping farm supervision labor, and changed from three teams to the slag team, departing from 8 a.m. a day to a high slope mine transport slag, I weigh only more than 90 pounds, and suffers There are pulmonary disease, carrying 100 kilograms of raw slag, behind the slope and then carrying dozens of miles on the back to climb the farm, physical strength Increasingly unable to adapt to the kind of overload physical damage, the management staff only gave me changes to work, arrange to plowing the fields for winter farming. \\nIn the winter of 1958, the sky was snowy, the farm asked to turn the paddy field to plough, cultivated in the field of cold-invasive bones, muddy to the thighs, and the ice crack pain. Enough of torture on the farm, Holodomor from 1958 to 1962 almost hungry, tired to death, lucky friends Fan Jiabin, Zhang Guofu and other adventure to save me, I also buckle cattle feed to eat, keep me not starving in the farm. In 1961, it was announced that the Land Committee approved the removal of hats and returned to Yanjin to work in the county supply and marketing cooperatives, pay treatment for handyman's wages, the work done by three people, and often suffered abusive 'hat-picking right without a good transformation'. \\nThe center-left wing of the Cultural Revolution mobilized rural militias into the city, shouting shouting people with different viewpoints, forcing me to jump off the river and flee. The river was caught back to the street for three days by the militia, standing high stool and beaten and criticized. Despite these hardships, despite the reservations, there has been no correction for decades, the accusations have not been made, and appeals do not work. Instead, they have to be caught and obeyed against their heart. Some leaders often use 'the past will let it go' to persuade, and they are also discouraged: to cause these whole parties are responsible...\\nDuring these years, the central archives decrypted, learned the truth and made clear that the disaster suffered by the people of the country and us in the past was caused solely by Mao Zedong's left route. Continued political campaigns after the founding of the country have caused hundreds of millions of people to be wronged, and what 'Premier League to catch the United States', 'Great Leap Forward' and 'People's Commune' starve to death 37.55 million farmers, are all the consequences of Mao Zedong's frantic pursuit of the extreme left route. In order not to allow history to repeat, he must be pinned to the shame frame of history. I advocate: one, use a certain amount of time to make Mao Zedong's sins clear; Second, take off the head of the hair from Tiananmen Square and put the hairs off Tiananmen Square and cremated the corpse of hairs out of Tiananmen Square; Third, we will pay our '57 people' for more than 20 years of salary, and compensate for decades of moral damage. \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"}

He is currently deputy director of the Ministry of Fisheries of the Central Fisheries Department. \\nPeng jing is the head of the right wing of Guangdong aquaculture system. His main reactionary words and deeds are:\\n1. Undertake anti-party sectarian activities, in an attempt to usurp the leadership of the Guangdong Fisheries System Party, plan, plan, systematic madness to attack the party. After he left Guangdong in 1954, he took great political ambitions, active activities, pulled together Wen Shengxiang, Zhong Jiemin, and Xie Ping (both right-wing elements), of the anti-party leadership core, actively plotting to reverse the case for Wen Shengxiang, seeking senior positions and supporting the Nanhai Fisheries Company. The anti-party plan of the nine 'gangs: cancel the party committee, remove party leaders, and conspire with Xie Ping to abolish the province's aquatic products A group of party members of the supply and marketing company, who returned to the Guangdong Fisheries Department as director, let the right and bad elements come to power in order to change the political direction of the party and establish his 'independent kingdom'. \\n2, negate the achievements of political movements, attack the Department of Aquaculture and Provincial Committee leadership. He described Yan'an rectifying wind as 'many old cadres now think of tears, to absorb Yan'an's lessons.' He also said: 'Guangdong's campaign is not objective,' 'mastering the town is too strict'. 'Yao Bao-you is just a cultural agent, not necessarily killed until today.' He used his tactics to protect landlord bullies and sabotage the land reform movement; resisted the three counter-attacks, saying that his unit was 'Qingshui Yamen'; he believed that 'rough, unobjective, the strike surface was too wide, and excessive harm to cadres.' He fabricated an attack saying: 'The Fisheries Department was not approved by the State Council', 'the Fisheries Department can not accommodate people', 'new aquatic products crowded out old aquatic products', 'negating the merit he had built up on rubble in the past.' He spread regionalism and attacked the provincial committee, saying: 'Comrade Tao casting led the work of Guangdong in these years is a lot of bias. It should not be such a hard hand under the other side,' and 'Guangdong rectifying movement, ceramic casting inconvenience, should be led by Yin Linping.' \\n3, in June 1957 to take advantage of the big ignition. He came to the departments of the Guangdong fishery system to organize dozens of anti-party elements, three anti-party and anti-opponents, instigating and instigating them to attack the party. Through individual conversations, 'sectarian meetings', and went to teahouse taverns for dinner, he made every effort to carry out anti-party ignition activities. Command 'tens of thousands of words' by right-wing elements inside and outside the Party, 'put it to the People's Daily, the Southern Daily, the Central Fisheries Department,' and 'combine up and down, cooperate with each other' to launch a total offensive. He wants to give the three anti-anti-opposition objects 'to 'redress' and incite 'grievances', saying, 'The Three Counterfests have made you lose your home.', 'You have rebelled against you', 'there can be comments to mention the Fisheries Department, and to the provincial committee without solving the problem, to the pottery casting 'You can put the luggage at the door of the provincial party, do not solve the problem will not go', 'to take advantage of the opportunity to achieve a complete solution!' That led the right-wing to the extreme. \\n4. The cadre policy of the opposition party, he has always used relying on anti-revolutionaries, bad elements and people with unclear political identity during his tenure in Guangdong to exclude members of the Communist Party and the military. He said: 'agents can be used, history is not complicated, it doesn't matter, stay in the organs is more insured than placed in society,' he said, 'rather than have one engineer to have thousands of Communist Party members.' Think of party members as 'wood' and 'signboard'. He defamated the Ministry of Fisheries and said: 'All the cadres of the department are giving gifts from others. The director is not competent, the level is not high, the director is low, and he does not understand business.' \\nIn the fight against the right, Peng jing was forced to admit anti-party and anti-socialist crimes in the face of a wealth of facts and solid evidence, but still not to recognize it as a subjective and conscious opposition. \\nPeng jing's anti-party and anti-socialist crimes were very serious. For this reason, it was decided to classify him as an extreme right, dismiss his party membership, remove his former post, and leave the organs to supervise labor. \\n23 June 1958\\nGuangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of the Communist Party of China (CCP), instructed that Peng jing be far-right, expelled from the party \\n[Compilation of Decisions on Purging Right in the Party (V)', prepared by the General Office of the Supervision Commission of the CPC Central Committee, December 1959]\\n"},

Although he was in Beijing for several years, he still assembled Guangdong localist forces and attacked the Party Central Committee and the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. In June of this year, he took advantage of the opportunity of the Party to rectify and return to Guangzhou, and organized the cadres in charge of Wen Shengxiang, Zhong Jiemin, and Xie Ping (who are the old cadres of localism), as the core of his leadership, with his old men and old cronies (a group of far-right groups of far-right groups). elements, right-wing elements, historical agents, counter-revolutionary), based anti-party groups, platform, planned and systematic Attacking the Party and inciting a large number of people who have struggled and dissatisfied elements in successive movements to fight against the party, conspiracy to usurp the leadership of Guangdong's fishery sector. \\nImmediately after Peng jing returned to Guangzhou in June this year, he and his group core elements Wen Shengxiang and Xie Ping drafted an anti-party proposal in an attempt to usurp the leadership of the aquaculture sector. The main purpose of the group's activities is to get back as head of the aquaculture department. The strategy is to spread rumors everywhere, crack down on the directors of the Guangdong Fisheries Department, elevate Peng jing's prestige. At the same time, the Jiusan Society Branch of the Nanhai Fisheries Company (already controlled by the right), went to the Fisheries Department and asked Peng jing to return to the head of the department. In the South China Sea Fishery Company, China Jiusan Society Branch proposed to abolish the party committee and party committee committee, remove the party member cadres and cadres, remove the manager, and by Peng jing, to arrange the current deputy manager to manage the general affairs, adding technical managers by the group's minions Feng Shun Lou (big corruption criminals, right-wing elements), and arranged a group of right groups There are elements in leadership positions at all levels of the company. In the anti-party proposal proposed by Guangdong Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company, 13 Party members or above cadres (the vast majority of foreign cadres and army retraining cadres), were evicted, and Wen Shengxiang was mentioned as deputy director of the thirteenth level. Peng jing said to these men before he left Guangzhou, 'You call below, I mention it above, and combine up and down, and things can become.' When Peng jing was in Guangzhou, by means of individual visits, meetings, banquets and other methods, such as ignition, poisoning, instigating and directing a large number of right-wing elements in the Guangdong fishery department, against the party's dissatisfaction, and the objects of previous movements, organized a large number of overthrow campaigns and aggressively attacking the Party's guidelines, lines and policies. \\nPeng jing met 76 people in eight days in Guangzhou, including more than 77 per cent of those with problems, including far-right, right-wing, historical agents and party dissatisfaction elements. The next day Pong Jing arrived in Guangzhou, a meeting called the 'sectarian meeting', which was attended by 13 people. Pont instructed them at the meeting: 'Questions about personnel, leadership, relations, business aspects, you write, can be sent to the Southern Daily, People's Daily and the Central Fisheries Ministry, and the leadership can solve.' \\nThis group of anti-party elements, under the command and instigation of Peng jing, went back to attack the party frantically. Chen Li, a far-right activist, organized a group of dissatisfied elements with the Party, organized the Infrastructure Evening News as a base for attacking the Party. He has written reactionary articles such as 'Rendezvous Guilty' and other reactionary articles in favor of Peng jing, and verbating the cadres of the CPC Section chief as 'Wang Eight Shameless He Shuyun, an opponent, cried to the organization, said that he had fought her against her, even rampant to return her crypto power books by the party organization, burned her materials related to the activities of the agent, and to cancel her rebellion conclusions. Lu Wenquan, who used to be an agent of Sino-US cooperation, also criticized there: 'I work on radio in cooperation with China and the US. Radio is a technical job. Is it also guilty of engaging in technology?' \\nAfter his return to Beijing, Peng jing has maintained close ties with his forty and fifty old men in Guangzhou, old cronies and local cadres. He favored everywhere that 'the underground party has no political capital' and that 'the underground party is a whole of all movements. Only foreign comrades are the most political capital, they are in power, and they come to the underground party.' He joined Wen Shengxiang, Zhong Jieming, Xie Ping and the old cadres of regionalism, spreading localist rhetoric everywhere from Beijing to Guangzhou, attacking the central policy line and the leadership of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. They said: 'When local cadres were in white horror, there was support for fashion in jail, but it is now hated'. 'Meixian has come out of a Marshal Ye (Ye Jianying), Haifeng has come out of a farmer king (Peng Pai). Could a county committee secretary not find it?' 'Ceramic casting secretary anti-localism is too ruthless, and should not be such a hard hand under the place.' 'Why did we commit the right leaning, they committed the left-leaning (left leaning in the eyes of the right-wing elements), and not punished?' 'Comrade Tao Zhu led the work of Guangdong, a lot of bias, wrong a lot of people.' \\nPeng jing's opposition party has a certain historical roots. He was an old party member who participated in the party in 1936. It was originally a local cadre from the south, but because of serious bourgeoisie individualism, he quickly combined with localists. In 1952, when the anti-localism in Guangdong, the Party decided to examine the losses caused by the mistakes of localism, and Peng jing refused to implement it. In 1953, when he criticized some of his mistakes in his work, he came up and said that the branch did not see his achievements, saying, 'I set up an aquaculture business on the pile of rubble, but came to me!' 'Not working in Guangdong anymore.' Later, he left Guangdong, but the grievances against anti-localism have not been eliminated. Peng jing's regionalism and individualist ideas have been developing, and when the bourgeois right-wing attacked the party rampant, he betrayed the party and collaborated with the right of the foreign bourgeois to attack the party. \\nAfter the anti-right struggle began, Peng jing panicked for its 'June trip' and specially arranged back south again. But the big debate has begun, and this large number of anti-party elements have been pulled out. Peng jing also had to begin to bow to plead guilty. 1957.12.7 (contained in Xinhua News Agency's Internal Reference 1957.12.9)\\n"},

It also violates and obstructs the implementation of the Party's policy and policies. In June of this year, he took the opportunity of the Party to rectify the wind, and he came to Guangdong with little intention from Beijing to ignition. Wen Shengxiang (cadre of the Fisheries Department), Zhong Jieming (deputy director of the Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau), Xie Ping (deputy manager of aquatic products supply and marketing company), and others formed small anti-party groups, inciting both inside and outside the party. of right-wing and dissatisfied with the Party, such as Li Keji, the '93' branch branch of the South China Sea Fisheries Company, Madness to the party attack. They spread the ideology of regionalism, attacked successive movements, attacked provincial committees in an attempt to overthrow the Party's leadership in the fisheries sector and establish their 'independent kingdom'. The anti-socialist rhetoric and deeds of Peng jing and his opposition group have been completely exposed during the anti-right struggle and the general debate on Guangdong's history, and have been severely criticized and resolutely responded. Peng jing's anti-party remarks and the critical material of his comrade Shu Guangcai and other comrades have been printed into a book for the reference of comrades. \\nFirst, the comprehensive materials of Peng jing\\nPeng Jing, Dongguan County, Guangdong Province, family origin workers, their own constituent students, participated in the party in 1936. Former Director of Fisheries Bureau of Guangdong Province, manager of aquaculture enterprises, is currently deputy director of the Marine Fisheries Department of the Central Ministry of Fisheries. Driven by his serious regionalist ideology and his attempt to seize the leadership of the Guangdong Fisheries Sector Party, and the personal political ambitions of the 'independent kingdom' that he wanted to establish since liberation, took advantage of the opportunity of the Party's winds to take advantage of a planned visit to South China Sea Aquatic Products Company and Provincial Aquatic Products for Public Sale in June this year Division, provincial fishery community, provincial aquaculture company and the department of aquaculture department to put poison, ignition, command and incite three counter-counter-actions The target, as well as dozens of other dissatisfied elements against the Party, took a big offensive against the Guangdong Fisheries Department. According to the public's revelations and his initial account, Peng jing's anti-party activities did not begin in June this year, but since the liberation of Guangdong, he has oppose the guidelines, policies and lines of the provincial committee and the Central Committee, obstructing resistance and sabotage of Guangdong's successive movements, and even wicked on individual specific issues. Poison defamation and slander. Peng jing's main anti-party activities since the liberation of Guangdong are as follows:\\n1. Harbouring landlords and undermining the agrarian reform campaign. In 1951, when Peng jing was the Director of Guangdong Fisheries Bureau, it was when the Guangdong Land Reform Movement was conducting vigorously, Peng jing used tactics, deceived and blinded the leadership, sheltered the peasant landowners who demanded to bring back to their village settlement struggle, resisting the farmers' arrest of pseudo-military officers and accumulating blood. Anti-revolutionaries. For example, Jiang Bang Li Keji, director of Taiwan's ice factory, Kuomintang elements and bully landlords, was detained at the Guangzhou Urban-Rural Liaison Office with the approval of the Public Security Bureau and the courts, to return to the village liquidation struggle, while Pong Jing repeatedly stressed the 'need for work' and asked his superiors not to send Li back to his hometown struggle; Jing comforted Lee Keji on another side: 'You have no problem.' Before traveling to Beijing, Peng jing solemnly spoke to Deputy Manager Lin Canghai and the Chief of Personnel Section that they must 'do their best' on behalf of Li. As a result, Lee Keji went unpunished. When farmers want Li Qing to retire their grain, Peng jing personally assisted Li Duofang to borrow everywhere, and said to Li: 'Try to find ways to raise the payment. If there is a real difficulty, you can write to the Urban-Rural Liaison Office to request relief.' Also like the Major-General's Director of the KMT (a cronist of Wang Yaowu, a war criminal), and a heavily indebted anti-revolutionary Wu Xiangqing, wrote a letter to threaten and insult the peasants during the land reform, saying, 'Clearing my home is a second stream.' At that time, 46 peasants were jointly stamped against Wu Xiangqing and asked the government to bring it to justice, with the approval of the Dapu County Public Security Bureau and the court to arrest the case. At that time, the leader of the Fisheries Bureau instructed on the arrest letter: 'Wu Xiangqing's materials were examined by us, not enough to be arrested. He performed very well with us here.' Equivalent. So the anti-revolutionary elements were sheltered in this way. In addition, he escaped the fight against Zhong Jiemin's landowner's father and ran to Guangzhou, Pong Jing allowed him to live in the office. He also helped Guan Pelun, Li Huaye and others to disrupt the land reform movement and obstruct the liberation of farmers. \\n2. negate the achievements of Guangdong Yundong, attack the provincial leadership. Peng jing said: 'I have a contradiction to the idea of counteracting sectarianism, because the people who engage in anti-sectarianism are all my old cadres. The negative side of the Guangdong Fisheries Department is not supposed to fight, too much harm to cadres.' Therefore, he is everywhere to fight against objects 'unfair', 'express sympathy', and 'grievance' for the opponents. Peng jing resisted against the three, cracking down on the prestige of Comrade Zhang Da, the head of the working group sent by his superior to help carry out the three counter-movements. When in the whole team, he was afraid that the place was not objective. He went to his subordinates Yang Xunrui, afraid that Yang would be broken down, so he returned to Guangzhou to cover the customs clearance. Feng Shun Lou, a major corrupt prisoner handled by Shanghai Municipality, Peng jing encouraged him to turn the case and requested a re-examination to the city of Shanghai. More serious is the consistent slander and attack of comrade Tao casting, such as saying: 'Tao casting secretary points my name everywhere when he went through investigation and research, he gave me criticism, and the three anti-movement was not tight, some rough.' And he said, 'The negative side is too wide, it is not objective.' And it believed that dealing with the problem was 'individual retaliation, not the collective leadership of the party'. In his final conclusion, he said: 'Guangdong is not objective to engage in the movement. Comrade Tao Casting has led a lot of deviations in the work of Guangdong in these years.' And said: 'Comrade Tao casting other side should not have such a hard hand. Comrade Ceramic Casting in Guangdong Province is inconvenient to lead this time, comrades should be led by comrades.' \\n3. Exclude foreign cadres, do not turn into the military, condone and reuse the bad elements of the whole team of land reform. Peng jing's anti-party action to exclude foreign cadres. When he came to the spike in June this year, he reached the point of attraction, such as Xie Ping, a member of his opposition group, to draw up an anti-party plan for the provincial aquaculture supply and marketing company. It is planned to include Wu Qiang, Li Yujie, Chang Bingyan, Fan Yuxiu, Zheng Yuhe and other sections. Above foreign cadres and army transition cadres were seconded to study in the name of their name, put them Pass away. In addition, Cheng Gong (pseudo-sheriff, expelled from the Party), and other people who have come down from the Land Reform Team should be mentioned as Cheng Gong was struggled while reforming the land reform team. Peng jing thinks he had no problem, it was the place wrong. Cheng Gong was expelled from Party membership. Peng jing lamented for Cheng Gong, and later specifically transferred Cheng Gong back to Guangzhou. Peng jing also repeatedly instigated the success of the case, complaining to the party. Peng jing not only excludes them, but also denigrated and slandered them, such as Peng jing believes: 'The conversion of military personnel is not a good thing, only people who tack or treat themselves.' Well instructed the Personnel Section: 'Do not reactivate cadres as far as possible, if the superior is assigned as a political task, as little as possible'. \\n4. To exclude members of the Communist Party by relying on counter-revolutionaries, other bad elements and politically unclear people. Peng jing violates the Party's cadre policy. In addition to combating the exclusion of foreign cadres and military personnel, another major problem is: 'Only only is used'. 'Anyone who has talent can be used, agents can be used, and the history of complex history does not matter, and agents are better placed in organs than in society.' Because of Peng jing's anti-party proposition, while he was in charge of the fishery sector leadership in Guangdong, he relied on agents, counter-revolutionaries, other bad elements, and politically unclear people. At that time, there were 46 leading cadres in the fishery department in Guangzhou (including individual transfers and dispatched), including 14 of the historical counter-revolution, special agents, the KMT bone and embezzlement elements; the rebellion and the three opponents are now nine of the right-wing elements. Of the 29 organizing clerks and cadres of more than 20, there are 13 opponents, as well as some members of the Al-Shabaab, pseudo-commune chiefs, and only 6 general masses and 4 party members. This shows how serious impure was the organization team of the aquaculture department at that time! Peng jing, relying on these bad elements at the time, first handed the fishing department of the aquaculture enterprise company to Li Keji in charge of the then fishery company; the Ministry of breeding appointed the brother-in-brother of Yao Bao-you (pseudo-education director), who was opposed to Yang Xunrui, the supply and marketing department, to hold the power of Huang Jiatong, who was politically unclear. Second, Peng jing also took 12 Guangdong agents, including military unifying agent Chen Xinneng, Major General of the KMT General Wu Xiangqing, anti-revolutionary Wang Bizhong, pseudo-military agent, historical agent Xu Minnet, and other Guangdong agents, KMT backbone elements, pseudo-military officers, embezzlement elements, and politically unclear people, are responsible for each department and branch manager, etc. post. Peng jing said: 'These old people I use very obedient, used very properly, Ken listen to the call, very talented'. He appreciated the anti-revolutionary Wang Bizhong. He said, 'I am the most ideal for this person.' So Peng jing boldly let go to rely on these people to do it. According to Peng jing's crony (far-right), Li Keji's statement: 'We are the core of our staff and work, rely on us to carry out business, all business plans and work arrangements are decided by our team.' He also said: 'Peng jing's trust in us is not only without differences within and outside the party, but also more trust than party members. At that time, the work of the Nanhai branch could have been entrusted to local party members in charge, but he thinks it was not (OK), but gave me responsibility.' And said: 'Peng jing put all business, to our team in charge, and think this is right, only our class talent (OK), usually speaking shows that we are his backbone, so the business research discussion, rarely look for party members to participate, think they do not understand the business, do not solve the problem. At that time, the whole business was his personal decision through our team.' According to FU Shangzhi, the far-right activist, said: 'For a few years, I have been self-occupied with Peng jing's cronship. My admiration for Peng jing is even more dead. Peng jing not only relies on these agents, anti-deceased and bad elements, but also actively involves regulators and family members of agents in society. The Personnel Section suggested that regulators could not be used. Peng jingtze said: 'Absorption of organs is more insured than in society. History is complicated, and couples will not be counterproductive in their work in the organs.' At last, under the instructions of Peng jing, Chen Xinneng's lover He Jingwen and other family members and social regulator Liang Xiangfa were absorbed to work. Peng jing also thinks these people can say, 'able', will blow, shoot, hold, and thus give them very high treatment. If Leung Cheung Fat wait for the door to give the equivalent of 20-19 treatment, Huang Jiatong returned from Hong Kong after liberation, he gave him a level 16 treatment. As a result of relying on these agents, counter-revolutionaries, pseudo-military officers and other bad elements, the work below is often chaos. Some suggested that they could not rely on these people, and that party members should be trained, while Pong Jing said, 'Who do not rely on them? Party members don't understand business, can not be responsible in leadership positions.' Because Peng jing firmly and actively implements the 'cadre policy' of the opposition, he does not hesitate to attack Communist Party members who have political consciousness and firm positions, who are able to faithfully implement the Party's policy and policies and are determined to take the socialist path. When Comrade Luo Oufeng had just arrived as deputy director, he was cracking down on his prestige, making it difficult for him to carry out his leadership work. He always thinks that the party members do not understand the business does not solve the problem, and openly said: 'rather than one engineer, not ten Communist Party members.' Consider Communist Party members as 'wood' and 'signboard', such as saying: 'In each person in charge of a familiar business, be sure to assign a party member to pay for the work that non-party members cannot pay, so even wood! It also has to put a swing as a 'signboard''. So Peng jing sent party member Kodak to be Lee Keji's 'wood'; he proposed to put the square into water as the 'signboard' of Huang Jiatong. Peng jing also moved the personnel section of Cai Lianjin, Wang Ruifeng and other party members away, and Chen Yongzhu (anti-object), master the main business of the personnel department so that he can do whatever he wants. Peng jing slandered the promoted party members and cadres everywhere, such as saying: 'Song Yong is unsincere, narrow and very narrow, and has no courage to do things, and is unmanageable.' Thinks that the promotion of Cai Lianjin, Chen Jinzhu and so on is inappropriate Peng jing came to Guangzhou in June and even stigmatized the leading cadres of the Central Fisheries Ministry. He thinks that 'a large part of the people are not competent enough'; 'The director is not competent and his level is not high'; 'The director is low energy, does not understand business'; 'There is a director better than Liu Qi (deputy head of aquaculture supply and marketing company)'; 'Some directors if 'The Secretary of Personnel is very incompetent, and even the supply and marketing company Cai Lian Kam is not as good as', etc. \\n5. Pong Jing came to Sui in June this year to carry out anti-party activities. Peng jing took advantage of it in late June this year to carry out anti-party activities. His methods and methods are diverse, as are vulgar city criminals. Such as individual conversations, summoning meetings, going to a tea house tavern, dinner (in Taiping Pavilion, Six Country Hotel, Ningchang Hotel, Dagong Restaurant, New Asia Hotel, as well as Li Keji and Xie Ping's home to eat as many as 60 people), every effort is made to carry out anti-party activities all day and night. Peng jing contacted 76 people during the eight days, the vast majority of them were right-wing elements (including far-right elements), historical counter-revolutionaries, anti-opponents, political unclear people and dissatisfaction with the party, accounting for more than 77%. Peng jing to Spike the next day, in the province supply and marketing company with his 'old men', historical agents, far-right elements Chen Li 13 people 'talks'. When Yang Xunrui was seen by Peng jing, immediately called Yang and said, 'Come, come to a sectarian meeting.' According to Zhou Xiaonian: 'Repeat the meeting two or three times to ask everyone to write about personnel issues, company leadership issues, business problems, drying rooms and other issues, and distributed to the Southern Daily, People's Daily, the Central Fisheries Department, the leadership cannot fail to solve the problem.' And said: 'The Ministry of Fisheries has bureaucracy that can sound to the central.' Finally, Peng jing designated Zhou Xiaonian to collect everyone's information, collate it, show him tomorrow, and emphasize that tomorrow we want to see the article. Peng jing also said to them: 'On the superiors of the aquaculture company should be straight line, I have raised opinions to the minister, the minister ignored, you mentioned below, the combination up and down, the leadership will have to consider.' At the same time, Peng Jing encouraged Chen Li said: 'Dry room has results (?), , the leaders should praise, write this situation out, and the leaders do not praise at least let the masses know, and get the praise from the masses.' At the instigation of Peng jing, Chen Li organized an anti-party group based on discontent elements and organized the Infrastructure Evening News as a base for attacking the party. He has written reactionary articles such as 'Rendeous Guilty' and other reactionary articles, aggressively attacking the Party member section chiefs, all 'forget eight shameless'. And in the reactionary article said: 'The honest chief of the past (refers to Peng jing), have been far away for years, are not fair.' Peng jing also incited opposition like He Shuyun said: 'Some opinions can mention the hall (Fisheries Department). If you don't solve the problem, we will go to the pottery casting there. In short, we should take advantage of the opportunity to find a thorough solution.' Finally, Peng jing asked Ho to say hello to her husband (Luo Zhanquan, the object). He Shuk Yun, at the instigation of Peng jing, she cried to the party, saying that he was wrong with her, and asked: (1), to return to her a code for an agent activity that was found in her home during the anti-counter: (2), burned materials related to the operation of the Lian China Powder Factory in Hong Kong as an agent activity; (3), to Seeking to repudiate her countervailing conclusion; (4), full salary during suspension must be fully repaid; (5), request the organization to reinstate Her reputation, and so on. Peng jing instigated opposition object Chen Xinneng to say, 'You should not be disposed of, downgrading you second level is unreasonable, you can take the plane to clear the problem.' He said that his beloved person, He Jingwen, should 'strive for a reasonable effort, demand all replacements, less and do not play, can be reported to the organization, and if necessary to report to the Fisheries Department, the Provincial Committee and the Governor of Tao, should be fully reissued', and so on. Peng Jing also incited Lu Wenquan, agent of the Sino-US Cooperation Agency, said: 'There are views on historical conclusions and should be thoroughly clarified.' Ludai became rampant at the instigation of Pont and asked the organization, saying, 'Is it a crime to engage in technology for the radio that I work in cooperation with China and the United States?' And shouted, 'Living in re-education through labor is unforgettable, it is a beast.' Public defamation of our re-education through labour policy. Peng jing paid special appreciation to Chen Yongzhu, an opponent of Su, who slammed us against Chen Yongzhu as a retaliation against Chen Yongzhu. He asked Chen Yongzhu to write a letter to him. He would send him specific opinions to the provincial committee and sued Minister Zhu of the Organization Department. And instigated Chen Yongzhu to say, 'You can put your luggage at the door of the provincial committee, and do not go without solving the problem.' Under the provocation of Peng jing, Chen made unreasonable requests to the organization to apologize and restore reputation. Sun Jingbo, of unknown origin, was struggled during the rebellion, he thought he had suffered grievances, met Peng jing and said: 'The problem of the three-door ship, can you testify for me?' 'You can testify for you,' said Punta Ching. So Sun Jingbo went frantically to the office, saying that he was wrong, cursed director Wu was 'Wang Eight Turtle' and asked for the disclosure of personnel files. In addition, they are directed against Jiang Jinming and Li Huaye, and other objects, how to attack the Party. Peng jing is sympathetic to the other objects of opposition, and uses 'you have suffered grievances' and other counter-revolutionary tone to incite the fire. In addition, Peng jing was directed to provoking and inciting elements dissatisfied with the party, Huang Haizhi, Lu Yongyuan, Huang inheritance and Cheng Gong, and so on. Therefore, Cheng Gong openly confronted with his superiors. Well and scolded leaders, 'Peng jing has scolded you for a meal, not yet accepted.' \\nIn addition to the above-mentioned poisoning ignition, Peng jing also organized Wen Shengxiang, Xie Ping, Zhong Jieming as the leadership core, including far-right elements Li Keji, Chen Li, Fu Shangzhi, Fang Guohua and general right-wing elements Cheng Yi-Yue, Cheng Gong, Ho Fu, Jiang Puming, Feng Shunlou, Huang Junmo, Huang Jieming, etc. based anti-party group. There is a platform, planned, systematic attack to the party crazy. Conspiracy to usurp the leadership of the Guangdong Fisheries Systems Party. Their plans for anti-party activities are as follows: First, rumors are spread everywhere, saying that leaders of the Guangdong Fisheries Department at all levels do not work, crack down on leading cadres and elevate themselves, such as defaming Manager Luo as 'Luo,' Manager Zhang 'is a librarian of the North Shaanxi school, and it is better to Zhen Yizhe'; 'Song leadership does not work. Things are not decisive, uncourageous' and so on. And rumors said: 'The Fisheries Agency has not been approved by the State Council'. These anti-party activities are intended to create a climate conducive to the return of Pong Jing to seize the leadership of the aquaculture system. Those historical counter-revolutionaries and bad elements also want to rely on Peng jing and take advantage of it. Second, Peng jing's anti-party group, plans to propose the following anti-party plan in the South China Sea Company by the Jiusan Society: abolish the party committee and the regiment committee, feel the Party member cadres, such as planning to redeploy manager Luo, manager Li only manages general affairs, adding technical deputy manager by Feng Shun Lou. Planning and Infrastructure Section should be merged with Li Keji., fishing technology department led by Fang Guohua, Zheng Xinhui (deforming molecule, far-right molecule), is the ice factory director, Huang Junmewei Head of Finance Section, Fu Shangzhi serves as the Director of the Movement Control Room. If this 'plan' is realized, all right-wing elements will occupy all levels of leadership in the aquaculture sector. Third, Peng jing and Xie Ping spoke in Beijing in June to propose the anti-party plan of the provincial supply and marketing companies, expelling Wu Qiang and Li Yujie's 13 cadres or more (the vast majority of foreign cadres and army retraining cadres). He said publicly that manager Song Yong should be removed from his post and mentioned Lu Yongyuan, Cheng Gong, Huang succession and so on as chief of section. Fourth, in the name of the Jiusan Society, invited Peng jinglai to serve as director and manager of the Nanhai company (Peng jing), Wen Sheng Xiangti is 13 deputy director. In short, Peng jing's arrogant plan and all the activities he carried out are aimed at removing foreign cadres, the army of conversion, and all the members of the Communist Party who are loyal to the cause of communism, and let him go to power with his old men-agents, counter-revolutionaries, other bad elements, and so on. To facilitate his 'independent kingdom' in the Guangdong Fisheries Department. \\nII. Exposure and criticism of the anti-party words and deeds of Peng jing and its opposition group\\n1.

In that year, he actively participated in the Democratic Revolution Movement led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the Chinese Allied Association, directly brewing and leading the revolutionary armed uprising in Datong on November 30, 1911. After a successful intifada, he was elected Treasurer of Datong's military government (new government). \\nFollowing the revolutionary ideas and ideals advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen for a long time, he has done a lot of meaningful and valuable things in the twisting and colorful journey of life. He was the only important person and leader of the party who had participated in the armed uprising of the Xinhai Revolution. \\nPeng jixian (1891 ~ 1967), once named Peng Jinwu, Shanxi Datong. Peng jixian, 17 years old in the year of Xuantong \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), was admitted to the first class of Datong Fuzhong School. Although the school is official, students are extremely active. \\nIn the summer of 1910, the Union General Assembly appointed the pioneers of the democratic revolution, Liu Guansan, Wang Huchen and Duan Yafu to carry out revolutionary activities in Datong, and conducted revolutionary propaganda in the university, military and business circles, 'gather comrades, comrades, comrades' and members of the secret development alliance. Peng jixian, Li Guohua and Sun Pei Xian, several highly motivated young people of Datong Fu Middle School have resolutely abandoned their rare learning opportunities to choose the League Revolutionary Organization and become the first members of the League's Datong branch after the secret formation of Lu Zu Temple, bravely engaged in any time and could lose their heads at any time. of revolutionary activities. After the establishment of the Association's Datong branch, charged Li Demao (former deputy director of Yan Xishan), to be the head of the branch, Liu Ganchen, Peng jixian, Li Guohua in charge of liaising with academics, Song Shijie, Sun Zhanbiao, Kong Xianlin in charge of contacting the military sector, Tian Runzhi, and so on. All walks of life in Datong, make full use of their social relations, contact revolutionary comrades, increase the revolutionary power, Thanks to their active contacts, they have joined Hao Zhen, Wang Zhi, Gao Baoyin and Monk (legal name: sexual cong), common law (legal name: Kailian), to participate in the League as important members of Datong Branch. \\nLate night of November 30, 1911, under the secret planning and organization of Li Guohua, Song Shijie, Peng jixian, Sun Zhanbiao, Kong Xianlin, etc., after several hours of fierce street fighting, the central town department, the government department and other key departments. Germany and other key officials fled the wind, and the Revolutionary Party people returned to the same. It is not a Japanese war, the gentlemen leak secret, and the Qing Army's 200,000 heavy soldiers fight against the same people, exposing the nascent revolutionary regime to a great threat. In particular, the subsequent consensual peace forced the military junta to dissolve, causing most revolutionary leaders to be extremely saddened. As a result, Peng Ji first turned Taiyuan in the fall of the following year and entered the Shanxi legal and political college chaired by Ji Gongquan. In mid-September 1912, Mr. Sun Yat-sen visited Taiyuan. Peng jixian, as a member of the Confederation and former head of the military government of Datong, was invited to give Mr. Sun Yat-sen's speech at Shanxi University Auditorium on 'Building to Clean Old Thought'. Later, he wrote a letter to Mrs. Sun Qingling, telling about his own words. \\nGraduated from university, he worked in Luan Tax Bureau, Yongji, Ruicheng tax inspection team.

After 1924, Yan Xishan was appointed as governor of Hejin County and Pinglu County in Shanxi Province. \\nAs a parent official, Peng jixian has done his best to secure the people and benefit one of the officials, military and river defense also have much trouble. Yan Xishan was extremely satisfied with his work. Therefore, when he was in North Fa, the Special Commission appointed him to serve as the military barracks of the third group of the National Revolutionary Army. In the spring of 1929, Xu Yongchang, President of Suiyuan Province, named Yan Xishan to Peng jixian, let him become the county governor of Linhe County. After Peng arrived in office, he actively coordinated the relations of ethnic minorities such as Menghan back, and newly built district townships, highways, post offices and banks, and solved many practical problems for the local area, and the social order was greatly enhanced. Local historians engraved his major achievements as county governor on the monument, remembered in the County Zhi, and the common people were particularly praised for his performance and ability. Even Mr. Yang Aiyuan, chairman of Zahar Province, near Suiyuan, has coveted for good talent, hard to dig this rare talent to the master to catch the social security of Chicha province. Late in the Central Plains War because Yanxishan fell Jiang, was forced to hide from the wild to Dalian, Peng jixian also went to office to Jincheng. In 1933, Mr. Xu Yongchang, Governor of Shanxi Province, intended to curb the growing spread of drugs in Jinjiang Province, believed that it was necessary to break drugs from the railway as a top measure. Governor Xu chose Peng jixian for his election to serve as police chief of Zhengtai Railway (Hebei Zhengding to Taiyuan Section). After the Japanese army encroachment, Peng jixian returned to Jincheng with the famous Hui revolutionary warriors, members of the Old League, his veteran boss Mr. Ma Jun and Ma Songnian to organize the fighting team against Japan. In the battle between blood and fire, he once again put life and death away, together with the patriotic warriors, brave to fight the Japanese pseudo-army and defend the dignity of the motherland. \\nAfter the surrender of Japan in 1945, Peng Ji first returned to his hometown of Datong to run the Zhenguang Printing Bureau, and was appointed honorary member by the Welfare and Prisoners Committee of the Daido District Court. \\nIn the early days of the liberation of Datong, he responded positively to the call of the people's government, taking the initiative to integrate all business investments under his name into the public and private partnership, making his best efforts to complete the country's socialist transformation of capitalist business and crafts. On November 22, 1958, Peng jixian will have the collection of woodcarved large edition Song Sima Wen manuscript set of 24, General Song Yuefei pro book Zushi Wu Hou out of the division table (Damo Tuo book), 14 axis, Mr. Ming Fu Shan book Zhongtang, Qing Yun Shouping flowers 4 pieces, Hanguan green glaze bottle, Hanguan Yunyun Changmo Feng Yu bamboo, colorful plastic People Khan Zhong away, the county department big print of Shanxi Jiefun Changmo-tuo statue of Changmo and other cultural relics total12 36 pieces all dedicated to the country. \\nIn June 1950, Peng jixian was elected as the regional representative of Datong in Zahar province, attended the first meeting of people's representatives of all walks of life in Zahar Province and was elected a standing member of the Consultative Council. At the end of 1952, the establishment of Zahar province was abolished, Datong City returned to the leadership of Shanxi Province.

In February next year the branch was upgraded to the Preparatory Committee of the People's Republic of China, as a member of the Preparatory Committee, still responsible for the work of social associations. During this period, he introduced more than 10 prominent social figures and patriotic intellectuals to participate in the organization. Later, he was mistaken as a right-wing element because he was hit by the expansion of anti-right struggle. At the same time, he withdrew his status as a member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC, the Municipal People's Congress, and the Preparatory Committee for Citizen's Leather, ceased his presence at the meeting and canceled the living expenses of 134 yuan. \\nPeng Ji was forced to tour the streets in the cultural revolution movement. At that time, despite the extreme political, life and spiritual injustices that he had suffered from many unimaginable hardships, he was unrepentant and remained convinced that one day the organization would help clarify his problems. In March 1967, 76-year-old Peng Ji first walked his hand among the patients. Twelve years later, the CCP Datong City East Street Committee removed its right-wing hat. \\nOn March 31, 1980, the leading group of the CPC Communist Party Party Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), in accordance with the relevant party and government policies, agreed to the 'Review and Correction Report on Peng jixian's right issue', approved the revocation of the decision to classify Peng jixian as right-wing and a series of false statements imposed on him because of the so-called right-wing remarks.

Someone can't drill it out in the copper hole, but I'm wrong with the money. Because money is bastard, you don't step on it and it bully you. I read a number of articles and concluded that China cannot progress without granting Mao society. I then found five or six 'five or seven' difficult friends and wrote to the Central Committee, asking him to approve Mao, it was too straightforward, and the people did not accept it. I also proposed to replace the hair with the image of Sun Yat-sen, and without discrimination, to welcome the body of Chiang Kai-shek to be buried in Zhejiang, and dragged the hair body from Tiananmen Square back to Hunan for burial.

Compensation for the wages withheld by the right. \\nSecond, compensate for forced labour, re-education through labour, re-education through labour, labour, labor, and battered work injury, disability, illness and medical expenses. \\nIII. Compensation of the victim for 22 years of moral damage. \\n4. Compensation for all losses suffered by the immediate family of the victim and the children. \\nFacts:\\nWe were all the people of the 1957 anti-right struggle movement, who were mistaken as right-wing elements by the party at that time. After more than 20 years of dehumanized persecution and hard labour, most of us have died, we are only a few survivors, and have been the old man of the wind candlestick, the waning of wood, this life is truly tragic. Although we were all 'rectified' after 1978, we resumed work, but soon reached the retirement age, the salary levels were significantly lower, some were treated as landless farmers, and some had died, but the families were still living at the lowest level. There are many people whose families are fragmented, so far the children of the company have failed to compensate, and grievances are faded. We are unable to afford or look sick and become a vulnerable group in society. \\nThe dead are hated, and the rest of the survivors will hate lifelong lives. To this end, only by reflecting the facts to you, please solve it in a timely manner in accordance with the Party's policy of 'people-oriented and harmonious society'. The right correction in 1978 was re-examined on the basis of the 1957 Criteria for the Partition of the Right, believing that the words and deeds of those of us should not be classified as rightists, and sent a 'right-wing correction notice' to resume work. Since we do not belong to the right, at that time we were dismissed, demoted, reduced, dismissed or sent to re-education through miscalculation of the right, and the wages withheld and reduced should be paid back at the same time, just as the Cultural Revolution's 'misappropriation and misappropriation case' was only in compliance with the statutory procedure. Not to mention the misrepresentation of the right who suffered longer and suffered more, at that time it was not allowed to argue, and was still forced by the organization's dictatorship. It is unjust and reasonable, however, that the wages of the wrong sentence have still not been paid. In contravention of the principle of 'equality before the law' enshrined in the Constitution, it would be wrong to treat citizens equally, not to speak of fairness and justice, and to establish 'double standards', so that the law was reasonable. Our Constitution considers 'citizens' wage income as the first legal income protected by law.' Article 41 of the 1954 Constitution states: 'Persons who have suffered damages as a result of violations of civil rights by State organs and agents of the State shall have the right to compensation in accordance with the law.' Repayment of wages to the right is done in accordance with the law and upholds the dignity of our Constitution. It is a violation of the Constitution, and the relevant departments and staff should be held accountable according to the law. \\nWe are not begging for gifts, we are legitimate debt collection. This is our legitimate legitimate right to forcible labor that we have been wrongly handled over the past 20 years, and blood and sweat in exchange for life in humiliation. Our Civil Code also explicitly states: 'The person in charge has the obligation to pay the debt.' Wages owed to the right are clearly a government debt, while the government has for a long time ignored and inacted on the reminders of creditors. This is neither wise nor an act of knowledge and law. The long delay, the Government loses its integrity, fairness and justice, and the hearts and minds of the people. Such inaction is extremely detrimental to the construction of a harmonious society that is 'fair and just'. If it is wrong, you should change it. If you work, you should pay it, and the debt owed should be repaid. This is a natural and righteous affair. It is that we are rich, and the Government should all compensate, in order to reflect our country's democratic respect for the rule of law in order to build a harmonious society, not to mention that our victims are still living at the bottom of society. \\nDear Dean of the High School, although you are not the makers of mistakes at that time, we will not blame you, but you are the successors of the party and the government. You are the heirs of the party and the government. You have the duty and duty to solve the problems left over history for the party and to pay back our salaries for more than 20 years in order to dissolve our current life. The dilemma. This is a kind move to share worries for the country, solve grievances for the people, get the hearts of the people and build a harmonious society. As for the calculation of wage repayment, according to the country's original Constitution, it is possible to refer to the current Law on State Compensation, regardless of the original position or grade, to a limit of 22 years, based on the average wage base at that time and the living index of rising prices plus interest. We look forward to an early and impartial verdict, and if we do not get a legal solution in the near future, we can only appeal or seek other means of redress. \\nList of complainants: Qu Chuping (79), Luo Shangneng (82), Huang Xinyi (75), Tang Daofu (83), Jiang Ershou (71), Peng mutao Mutao (75), Ou Ming (89), Huang Shaofu (83), Ma Wancai (75), Yan Daiwu (86)\\n Contact Person Peng mutao Mutao, Tel. 028:8749408.

Effective methods or measures can be put in place that can lead to productive development in all political and economic activities. \\n2, if it is determined that the Bureau is the production administration, it is urgent to further familiarize yourself with the business, put the main energy on in-depth production, research and production. As the cadres of the Bureau of Basic Building Materials, they should at least understand the integration of organic cooperation between the various departments of the enterprise. No, it is impossible to talk about further improvement of production. According to my understanding, many cadres in the current situation are low in knowledge in this area. By now this set, it can only be principle cadres and can't improve production without understanding production, and having scientific methods will not have practical results. 'Good intentions are not equal to good results.' This makes sense....\\n3, if both are to, it should be a good estimate of the power, make good adjustments, staff double learning. Otherwise, really solve production problems less, deal with more work. \\n4, no matter what must be done with the factory, point to clear the boundaries of work, the scope of competence, the tube tube, no matter, to the plant in plan management, financial management, cadre management, staff handling, welfare facilities, etc. under the National Reunification Plan, the factory should be given full autonomy rights. The Bureau only mastered the production balance, major technical organizational measures, key issues of production, and political thought education for employees, so that the factory can exercise more subjective energy and enable the leadership of the Bureau to get rid of the business circle. Child, it is possible to spend more time to learn business and go deeper into the field. \\n5. The last time the division merger is very good, should promptly investigate and re-revise the work system of the various departments and departments, must be carefully implemented, and at the same time, consideration may be given to changing the Bureau Secretary to the Office of the Director to compensate for the inadequacy of the head of the department and the lack of contact between the departments. \\n6. Expanding democratic leadership. All major problems in the production work should receive more managers to participate. All kinds of conference documents and information should also inform the executives concerned, not only subjective decisions within the Party or often some minority decisions, this will avoid bureaucracy and clanism, and more exert everyone's work enthusiasm. Creativity, mobilize all positive factors, and at the same time, the Bureau's leaders should also often supervise the inspection work. \\nII. Observations on streamlining bodies\\n7, according to the spirit of the central, provincial and municipal levels of streamlining institutions and the Bureau's production tasks repeatedly cut, it is necessary to take the following measures:\\nI), the abolition of the two innings, the personnel to the much-needed place to go. \\n2), or add some tasks, receive a machinery company, in fact, we Yongtai construction is now also working as machinery company products. \\n3), temporary decentralization of personnel, focus on helping the factory to engage in several things (such as improving management, revising the system, learning experience, etc.), waiting for the future work needs to return. \\n8, in the streamlining agency handling personnel, the following principles must be implemented:\\n1), strong cadres must be delegated to the grass-roots level and cannot be replaced gradually. Otherwise, they will still do nothing, because the level of grass-roots personnel is very weak, and the task is very heavy. Otherwise, it will not achieve this year's purpose of streamlining the upper level, enriching the grassroots, and really helping the grassroots play a role. \\n2), must speak of clear-cut persuasion mobilization, the method should as far as possible adopt voluntary application, organization approval approach. Only by making everyone realize that decentralization is glorious, not incompetent, can we achieve the peace of mind and the satisfaction of those who go. \\n3), the personnel department must clear the basic thinking weakened to remain strong strange. Adhere to the principle of selflessness, do not throw the burden, do not leave a hand. \\n4), our grass-roots units, in addition to Yongtai, construction, the situation is 'more than the above, the following is also a lot not to decentralize the plant, should be surpless personnel to the municipal committee, municipal editorial committee unified distribution. \\nThird, the political thought education of employees\\n9, must first unify the leadership of the higher party committee, party and political corps, to assume this main responsibility. Ideological work has left this force, and it is difficult for any individual education sector to do well, and it is therefore suggested that future campaigns must act in a unified manner, not one. There should be a systematic plan for educating employees in political ideology, and should be kept constant, so that the masses can be approached and their minds are not confused. This issue can also be suggested to the municipal committee to consider transferring the relationship between the factory party committee to the party group in the Executive Council, to make it easy to work, or to avoid a catch on everyone in the past without asking. The current current study of current affairs and politics, and the work of united warfare, this year's advanced producer movement, municipal committee, district committee, and bureau did not take care of it seriously, and should draw attention. \\n10. Staff education must be taken to persuade education, use a democratic way to solve it. Now the best way is the 'congress' which is a good place for leaders and leaders from bottom up self-criticism and self-education. Leaders at all levels should pay great attention to this form, the Bureau should be very well strengthened to lead and develop a suitable system (e.g., head of party and political corps during meetings The subject matter, the central content of the General Assembly, the review and implementation of proposals, the proportion of representatives, Assembly rights, meeting time, etc.), in which individual workers are indeed rogue, should also be educated through the General Assembly, constant teaching or not too accommodating, and dismissal is also one of the education. \\n11, should strengthen staff technical training, can open amateur technical training courses, so that employees have a clear understanding of the construction industry, have confidence in work, but also can improve the maintenance of safety and realize human potential. The matter should also be organised by the Bureau, so as not to form artefacts and timeliness. \\n12. Education cadres must be patient with the masses to persuade the masses, overcome the rough dryness and simple and hard methods, strengthen the leadership of the party and political corps in factories and workshops. The personnel department should also displace strong people with certain political training, because this is the forefront of teaching jobs., wrong method, disgust will be more. \\n13, with the masses, to participate in manual labor should have a focus and purpose, can really improve their own help others through in-depth experience, so it is also necessary to establish some systems, can also organize family visits, talk individually, often care about the lives of the masses, pay serious attention to the people's small problems Responsible solution is one of the most vivid education. Do not graphic form, walk through the field. \\n14. In order to be able to ensure the uninterrupted education of workers, consideration may be given to establishing an education section or assigning a special person. Because neither the Labour nor the Personnel Section are now in charge, and in fact there are more workers than cadres, although a few more people have been added, the results have been significant. \\nFourth, to strengthen production technology leadership\\n15, the Bureau should strengthen the technical force of the organization leadership, trust them and give the task (major technical measures to identify and produce major reform), and give research, experiments, visits, study materials and other material conditions. \\n16, pay attention to the development and inheritance of new technology capabilities. \\n17, historical data collection and experience introduction (brick and tile sand have a lot of production experience lack of scientific summary and finishing)\\n18, Bureau of all comrades can be necessary to learn production technology, guided by engineers and factory technicians, first drill brick machine performance and wheel kiln principle, further learn soil analysis, chemical roasting, gravel grade, civil construction, steel structure, which is necessary for our work. \\n19, the party and the executive leadership do not rude her interference in the technical same topic, to experiment with technical encouragement, patience (tunnel drying method is an example), at least ask not to understand, understand and pursue, cancel some clear rules (scope expanded). \\n20, by the Bureau to the factory should set up a 'rationalization proposal committee', seriously strengthen the work leadership, this workpiece must rely on the support of the executive leadership, technical staff to achieve. \\nFive, the use of cadres training reward and punishment promotion\\n21, to change the direction of personnel work, both the cadres of the administration and the factory cadres; otherwise, it cannot guarantee the strong leadership of the Bureau. \\n22, the use of cadres should not only have a view of life, but also to cultivate a professional view, to measure the use of materials, to qualitative terms. The established type should not be transferred casually, and if necessary, do not change business, so that cadres can love the profession and increase their confidence in work. This also meets the requirements of Comrades of Little Odd (refers to that time), for 10 years, 20 years or even a lifetime. It should also be recommended that the personnel department should use the principle of future cadres as administrative provisions. \\n23, the use of dry should also clear the scope of responsibility (now not suitable can be adjusted), to ensure that each cadre can have a certain scope of work, have the authority to discharge duties and responsibilities, and give sufficient trust. Meetings that are working issues, documents should be given the opportunity to participate, combining the specifics with abstract cadres. \\n24, training and further training should have certain reasonable provisions, and should be revised in the past, and must ensure the training of outstanding people (regardless of party, group, group), because this is the mainstream of our progress, should cherish the essence of these revolutions. Further training should also be done more by the Bureau or by participating in the municipal committee. The Bureau shall give material guarantees and time guarantees. Short-term exit learning is certainly better. \\n25, the reward and punishment should be judged by events and cannot be made political distinctions, regardless of the motivation, should look at the actual consequences, and be fair. \\n26. There should be an annual standard for cadre promotion, (i.e. promotion between several years). The central government has adopted a cadre policy that does not rise in the next few years due to the large wage rise last year (over the right point), it seems that there are some 'left' proposals on this:\\n1), the annual promotion should be carried out, because this is to encourage cadres to move forward, and is also a sign of contributing to the people's work achievements. In order to reduce the burden on the State, consideration could be given to upgrading without salary increases. \\n2), Comrades of the minority party members who are now mentioned too quickly, should educate them to be humble, practical, do not understand the pretend, do not blindly complacent. Put down the shelf close to the masses, sincerely meet, the masses will surely welcome. It is important to learn from each other to improve, level differences and job requirements are too great for organizations to consider. It must be pointed out: to drop down from the leadership does not mean that the masses give up their leadership, because the masses have consciousness and will conscientiously accept the leadership of the Party, as long as the Party Committee regularly checks and urges it. \\n27. In order to eliminate sectarianism, personnel departments gradually decentralize experienced senior cadres, have a fair and strict working style. They must be notified beforehand for future cadre movements, obtain the consent of the relevant departments and the workers who move the job themselves, and move on the basis of the understanding of ideas, to prevent forced and hard mobility. Prevent roll-out regardless. \\n28, the theoretical learning of cadres, current affairs policy learning and improvement of the work level, should pay careful attention to the assessment to master the actual ability of cadres. It is best to establish a regular appraisal system to restore year-end appraisal. \\n29. The historical and political issues of cadres must be taken in a spirit of high seriousness and responsibility, as far as possible to the cadres to draw conclusions, and the files are also for reference only. The main thing should be done carefully and constantly, to understand the changes in human beings, not to be bureaucratic, hold up ideas, and make the problem absolutely absolute. In this regard, a small number of cadres who have problems are also required to give their own initiative to help organizations make early conclusions in order to dissolve their ideological concerns. Just ask for a well-deserved mind. Real gold is not afraid of fire, bold and responsible for the initiative. \\n30. Personnel departments should pay attention to the lives of the masses, pay attention to the moral education in life, should have some care for the welfare of cadres, make the system fair and reasonable, become common and should be disclosed to the public. \\n31, cadres should be given time to take care of domestic chores, generally belong to the work research arrangement should be arranged in working hours, housing is too far away should be transferred. \\n32, should pay attention to the organization of cadres collective activities (such as outing, rallies, visits, cultural and sports activities), to expand the scope of life, so that leaders and masses, comrades and comrades have more contact opportunities. \\nVI. Observations on the Working Group\\n33, the organization of the working group, must fully estimate their strength, the members of the group must be familiar with the production, understand the situation to draw time comrades, such as members improper (the factory working group is an example). \\n34, the working group plan not subjective development, do not greed much greedy. As long as you can get down to the factory to do one or two major good things, it will play a good role. Because subjective substitution is often either a hollow principle or impractical. It is better to study more business work because to improve management, it is necessary to understand the working methods. \\n35. Within the working group, we should concentrate democratically, exert all forces, collective research and jointly decide that all meetings at all levels of production work should be consulted. Within the group has the right to resolve it should be resolved. Do not have the right to make suggestions to the factory or bureau to solve. \\n36, on the current factory working group opinion, can send people from the bureau should be very well organized, do not list, tasks assigned clear, work arrangement, if not sent, change to the resident staff only responsible for understanding the production, timely reporting of problems. \\n37, now the three factory working group should focus on labor education work. Because the wheel kiln, brick machine are technical problems, and the general improvements we propose are mentioned in the factory, we are only suitable for understanding the situation, political thought education work. \\nVII. Issues for the labour force\\n38. Last year, blind recruitment caused a lot of losses. Leaders did not pay attention to the recruitment work, causing cadres to violate government policies, decrees (where the program formulation is wrong is age, health, probationary period, not to convert to military personnel, etc.), and recruit hard, disrespect the local government, and at the time spent a lot of strength to recruit. Foot, the formalities have not yet been clarified, and now we want to retire. These should be well learned and handled. \\n39. Because the Personnel Section, regardless of worker education, labour department is trapped in transactional work (all day allocation, calculation, revision of quotas, labor protection, labor conditions, wage standards, etc.), and the lack of force of the Party and Political Workers Corps, the entire worker's education work is concentrated at the most grass-roots level. And these comrades themselves have a very low level of work, lack of political training, good ones are active, and bad ones take simple and rough, move to punish and abuse people (many of the hard methods of the three-brick factory do not leave if they don't clean up health on Sunday, borrow books and deduct money, absenteeism without participating in compulsory labor, workers Reflecting four wicked dogs), caused a lot of disgust among workers. Therefore, the overall performance among workers is not the conscious work of the working-class, but rather a meritocratic view, saying money, willing to do everything, workers and leaders are not heads and leaders for their own people, but rather think that money purchases surveillance, which in turn has led some people to think that the national law protects workers (dare not open Except), leadership fear of sharp contradictions, bad elements rise, some personnel figure personal interests (to earn money as a principle), less Some people can not rise up by evil gas, this is a prominent contradiction of the current factory, and deserves great attention to the bureau. In this regard, it is recommended that the personnel department of the Bureau must put strong cadres at the grass-roots level, and should replace the incompetent head of the work section. At the same time, it should also strengthen the power of the party branch branch in the workshop, hoping that the leadership cannot ignore this weak and important link. \\n40, at present because of the task reduction and deal with workers, I consider it important, involving labor issues are also prominent. Therefore, this should be the main task of the Bureau. In addition to retaining some staff to maintain the post-partum planning arrangements, the main forces of the Bureau should be drawn out to do the job withdrawal (including workers' statistics, differentiation, adjustment, audit, mobilization and persuasion education, reception escort, funding arrangements, etc.), are a series of ideological work and organization of work. The Bureau should draw up efforts from the various departments to formulate a more practical and detailed work plan, but also in advance to contact the municipal committee, provincial committee, provincial labor bureau and Suining area in order to prepare. \\nEight, the issue of joining the party\\n41, party organizations should correctly grasp the principle of organization, agree that the party organization does not develop opinions this year, good reckoning is necessary, I suggest that it can be extended for a few more years, because there are deviations, such as individual party organizations in the development of sectarian sentiments (such as sand division), think the party member line is only my line, party organization Preference to bias, do not love to listen to the opposite opinions, and do not get more correct opinions, so In developing, the quality of party members has been reduced, and it also undermines the authority of the Party. If it is not corrected in a timely manner, future development will be more detrimental to the cause of the Party. \\n42. Some party members go because they join in a peaceful environment, generally not through a more serious difficult test, lack of knowledge, experience, plus party organization ideological teaching is not enough, social development situation is fast, many party members comrades are promoted quickly by the party. 'Messenger of Today, Jazzz of Tomorrow', 'Leapfrog Longmen, worth ten times.' And the task in front of the work is very difficult. They are neither very well researched, they are not willing to listen to the opinions of the masses, do not learn nothing but to be generous. The masses have concluded that they are 'not enough to praise people, they are not enough for the benefit of people', although the number of such people is not many, but some are not good for work. Education corrects, otherwise it will be detrimental to the cause of the party, so it is recommended that the party organize this time not only to rectify the wind now, but also To tighten the process, not only the responsible cadres of the Party, but the general cadres must also be consolidated. At least they must also pay attention to the Party's ideological education. This is because the Party is leading the cause of socialist construction, these comrades are standing in the current very important positions. \\n43, the whole wind can not become a gust of wind, should always keep the wind and rain. To this end, it is necessary to establish the necessary systems, such as regular party associations, mass seminars and the organization of talks. Party members must care for the masses, help the masses and so on. At the same time, protection against retaliation (whether direct or disguised), is guaranteed. \\n44. The party should seriously and responsibly reply to anyone who requests to join the party and seek progress, regardless of their motivational conditions, should point out the direction of efforts, and should seriously help them improve their shortcomings, create conditions, no delay in the backlog, and in the future party organizations should establish a regular inspection system. (This is according to the fact that some party organizers at that time applied for membership in the party to some of the people they considered impure motives or conditions were inadequate, leaving aside for a long period of time, causing them to be burdened with their minds). \\n45, the organization should be responsible for leadership. In particular, too many members of the Bureau of the Second Bureau should attract special attention from party organizations, requiring organizations to care more about them. It is best to be able to make a deal with the comrades who have already applied for, indicating the direction to encourage progress. \\n46. Party organizations should pay special attention to opinions from the masses. This is especially important in the case of our party group too much, to constantly check the work style of comrades of party members, party relations, and listen to some negative opinions of the masses. \\n47, the party should strengthen the leadership of the united war work, at present the United War work is three regardless of (city, district, bureau regardless of), comrades below feel that the united war work is very hot hand, the principle of Taiyuan, is too specific. And many cadres do not understand the policy of the united war work, and have not yet established a unified war system, they should be made up soon. \\nIX. Opinions on the organization of the mission\\n48. The work of the second regiment was not carried out with the Party's help, but also with the regiment municipal committee, organ committee, and total peace arrangement only do not check, only in the above seriously out of the bureaucratic style of the masses. Originally last year, the ideological education work could also be brought to the party through the higher regiment committee committee, but they did not care about it without knowing it, so they lost their organizational role. \\n49, the branch really care about everyone less, the branch does not seriously take responsibility. The disadvantages of the work of the upper branch are greater than the advantages, but hard according to the achievement is the main, the disadvantages are secondary, to write, not this is a violation of the organizational principle (the advanced workers report is also true, the support committee presumes that the work is busy, and the staff is dispersed), The identification of team members is too subjective, even to the superior congress committee There is no courage in opinions, how to safeguard the interests of the members of the team, this should draw the attention of the group organization, this kind of compromise to the shortcomings The situation should be rectified immediately. \\nX. OTHER ISSUES\\n50. Because of the different nature of the administrative organs, cadres are not good for life welfare, they can set up trade unions of organs as soon as possible, and each unit set up an 'interactive fund association', and a portion of the bureau's business expenses to help comrades in urgent danger. \\n51, the Municipal People's Committee is too big, must strengthen management, usually only distinguish between old and old, but bad guys are not easy to detect, the delivery room should be moved to the hole after the voucher entry. \\n52, the housing adjustment part to the general cadre use, especially far away, children. \\n53, go to the two canteen cross line should be in contact with the City Transportation Bureau, may be, not possible should walk the cross line. Otherwise, it is not commensurate with the status of our national cadres.' \\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attachment 3】Peng mutao Mutao: The Truth of 'Chengdu Right Countercase Group' in the Cultural Revolution (Huaxia Digest 2017.11.6)\\nIn 1970, in the 'one dozen and three counter-attacks' of the country's 'counter-right downturn', the relevant personnel in Chengdu, Sichuan, in order to keep up with the situation and meet the needs of their superiors, they went back and turned away from them, who originally considered that we were not the right, but 'victimized revolutionary masses'. Anti-revolutionaries of the 'Chengdu Right Countercase Group'. \\nTake us as scapegoats, practise proletarian dictatorship, from strict punishment, tour the streets throughout the city, with announcements full of city coverage, radio, television, and newspapers all the way. Some people in Chengdu have turned such a mischief that is untrustworthy, non-inverted and bloody, into a 'great victory' of the Cultural Revolution. \\nWhat kind of a 'right-wing group' are we?\\nBefore the designation of the right, several of us were young students of young age and very good origin. Just liberated, we participated in the revolution and became grass-roots cadres in the public security political system, half of which were party and team members. \\nPeng mutao Mutao participated in the National University in 1951, redeployed to the Political Office of the Public Security Brigade, in 1954, transferred to Sichuan Province joint venture into the iron factory, in 1955 to Chengdu Light Industry Bureau secretariat work, general committee member. In 1957, in the rectification movement, Peng mutao responded to the call of the Party organization to help the party to rectify the wind, and proposed 'suggestions' to the party organization on improving the work, based on the problems in the actual work in the bureau. At that time, he was endorsed and supported by Director Zhao and members of the whole team who presided over the winding work. \\nLater in the anti-right wing, the unit in question led the organization, distorted the facts, taken out of context and went on the line, and beat Peng mutao into the right-wing. \\nLi Quanrong is a general working cadre party member of the Political Department of the Chengdu Municipal Public Security Bureau. In the middle of the wind, he raised criticism about the work of the unit. The result was also classified as a right-wing element. \\nLi Bingjie was originally an internal affairs officer at the police station in Binsheng Street in Chengdu. He was suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. He was on duty with another person one night before the wind. All right in front of a map in the office exclaimed: 'If I go to the Northeast to treat this disease too cold, to the south to cure it and too hot, Taiwan's climate is suitable, but No liberation.' The one in the anti-right expose him: 'On duty, they are looking at the map delusions to flee Taiwan's enemy treason.' His father had only been a mechanic in the old society, and changed his origin to the landlord, classified as a right-wing, expelled from home. \\nWang Xueqi was originally a clerk of the Chengdu Intermediate People's Court. He never made a formal statement at the bristling meeting. It was just at a weathering meeting. Some people said: 'Our court, from the president to the kitchen cooks, are leaders of the Communist Party members.' She made a 'oh' voice at the meeting. Later speakers said that she supported the Party world of Chuu Anping. She was classified as the right with the view of 'endorsing the right' and expelled from home. \\nThere is also Jiang Shisen of the suburban government of Chengdu, who is also a general staff member. He usually speaks somewhat sharp and sour. He loves to joke before the wind. He said × the governor's correspondent, in front of the district governor, just like the harlequin in the Chuan play 'Yingxian shop', bending back, Vino a minions. The anti-right activist who defamed the party was the anti-party, and was beaten as the right. \\nIt is such a few people who were wrongfully beaten into the right, on the basis of which the organization has dealt with, and has no new fault, and there is no reason for countless battered and assaulted persecutions. This is the minimum legal norm. But from the very beginning of the Cultural Revolution, we started the knife. Red guards plauded their homes every day, spit, caught hair, parents, children, brothers and sisters at home were abused, arbitrarily bullied, without peace, suffering, life is better than death. \\nHow did I go home to be persecuted\\nIn 1962, I worked on a farm in Xingjing County, Ya'an area, after the Great Leap Forging, Sichuan Province, after the Great Leap Forward, and later the county took the opportunity to cancel the minimum wage in the name of streamlining compression and compress me home (this is another unreasonable punishment). \\nChengdu is the native place of my ancestors for three generations, but because of the name of the 'right', the name of the 'right' can not be a household. A citizen who holds the right to vote, has become black for more than two years. \\nBlack black households don't matter, anyway, I am an insulted and damaged person. The key issue is that I can't get life-sustaining food, temporary workers can't find jobs for temporary workers, but the 20-year-old head man needs to close to 60's old mother and young child to save rations to feed myself, it's really enduring No heart, but no other way, neither dare to steal, nor to rob, hear the child Call the stomach hungry is more like a knife. Look up to heaven, what sin do I have! \\nIt was only in 1964 that one of the neighbours left the right from the labour force injured and returned to his home home. With the approval of the Public Security Department, I went to the household, and I went to the office again to obtain approval. I went to the account to find a job,I found the fundamentalist my fine arts teacher Li,He understood my skills and level,Introduce me to the cinema to draw posters,After a trial in the theater can,Call me fill the form,I think that if I do not explain my right-wing problem,I'm afraid of the teacher,And deceived the organization,I only With a factual fill in, the outcome of the political trial will not be closed, not admissions. In the end, it is only to sell hard labor, do temporary workers, maintain a life. \\nWe were deceived for the second time in the Cultural Revolution\\nAt the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, my relatives, friends and people who care about me repeatedly said: 'This is the beginning of a big political movement. Be careful, remember the lessons of history and do not get involved.' I listened to the advice of my loved ones, done completion, lunch tea break, I all alone put the tea end to the corner, different from anyone to talk, on the way back, do not go to the big print newspaper, go straight to avoid trouble. \\nBut soon, things go against their wishes, and those who create contradictions 'do not take the will of man as a transfer.' The villains and red guards of my beloved unit came, saying that I was the right, forcibly put my account down. I was not allowed to stay in the unit dormitory, not allowed to work, and drove out of the house. Family and friends do not dare to accept, staying at the hotel and no proof, overnight, live on the streets, it is not as good as death. \\nFaced with this brutal fact, we will consult with several right-wing parties in the district to go to Beijing to learn about the Party Central Committee's policy, how to deal with these of us, whether there is a way out. A few of us went to Beijing in December 1966 to find the mass reception office of the southwest group of the Central Cultural Revolution. Several of us reported their situation to the reception leaders truthfully. After listening to our report, he said: 'At that time, the anti-right wing of the Chairman Mao Party Central Party was mainly directed at those big intellectuals of the bourgeois who were dissatisfied with the Communist Party, like you are the basic masses of the Party. They should not be classified as right-wing elements at all. This is, the ruling party that follows the path of capitalism. If you do not listen to Chairman Mao's words and do not act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, now you should rely on local revolutions for rebellion Sent up to expose their crimes of carrying out the Bourgeois reactionary route. \\nImmediately sent us a letter of introduction to the Provincial Revolution and the local revolutionary organizations, and sent a ticket back to Chengdu. We passed the letter of introduction from the Central Cultural Revolution reception station to revolutionary organizations such as the Provincial Revolution and Chengdu Workers' Artificial Revolt Corps, 826 and Hongcheng. With their support, we are seen as being subject to the bourgeois reactionary reactionary Route persecution of the revolutionary masses, the Corps gives us office room (Palace of Culture), , pen and ink paper, etc. \\nWith the support of the local revolutionary organization, we wrote the executives of the reactionary line of bourgeois, contrary to Chairman Mao's instructions. In 1957, the anti-right movement shifted the general direction of the struggle, distorted the facts, reversed the wrong, infinite outline, fight against the persecution of the masses, and reported to the Provincial Reform Commission for review. Other than that, we have not been involved in any other activities. \\nAt the time of writing the material, it was suggested that, since the Central Committee, the Provincial Reform Commission, and the revolutionary rebellion do not regard us as bourgeoisie right-wing elements, but as a persecuted revolutionary masses, whether we set up a revolutionary organization of the 'May 7 Corps', specifically to engage in great criticism. At that time, as long as a revolutionary masses, two or three people were free to form revolutionary organizations without anyone's approval. But I still said: 'This matter should be cautious and not to mess up. First write a report to the Provincial Reform Commission and ask whether a revolutionary organization can be set up to make great criticism. If the above approval, then engage, no approval is counted.' \\nWe have submitted our report, but no response has been received, and we have not established any organizations. However, in 1968, when they responded to the 'right-tipping wind', 'one dozen and three counter-narration' and 'cleanup class ranks', they obeyed the political needs, treating the 'basic masses' and 'victims of the bourgeois reactionary route', and at a moment treated as a 'right-leaning group' to turn the case off. 'the anti-revolutionaries in the party, the government... revolutionary organizations' to punish them. \\nDuring the detention interrogation, three questions were posed to me:\\nFirst, why should I set up an organization to turn over the case of the anti-right movement? \\nI replied at that time: We did not have any organization at all, nor have we turned over the case of the anti-right movement. We are according to what the Southwest Group of the Central Cultural Revolution told us, you go back to rely on the local revolutionary rebellion, expose the crimes of the ruling faction who follow the path of capitalism against Chairman Mao's right line, and let the revolution be made. The masses criticize. With the support of the Provincial Reform Commission and the revolutionary opposition, we wrote about their own persecution. We are not negating the anti-right movement. We believe that Chairman Mao's anti-right struggle at that time was right, and that the right-wing elements who had been reported to have attacked the party were rampant and should be combated. However, we really responded to the party's call to help the party to rectify, to safeguard the interests of the Party. There was no anti-party anti-socialism. It was only distorted by some leaders of our unit at that time, taking out of context and wrong handling. Now we are only pragmatically telling the truth to the Party, seeking clarity, restoring honor, and continuing to work better for the Party for the people. \\nWe also handed over several complaint materials on behalf of others, including Zhou Yingren right teacher in the city five middle school, Baikaimao right teacher in 18, Li Shaokang right teacher, Dazhu County Committee Propaganda Department Li × ×, Sichuan Department Store Xu Guoping, Provincial Metrology Supervision Bureau, Daxian District Red Army cadre Zhu Leqiu and other complaint materials. \\nThere are also two possibilities for the complaint material handed over to the province: one is the right, who is really mistaken like us, asking for the screening and rehabilitation, and the other is that the real right wants to turn the case out, by me by inducing these real bulls and snakes, should also be an opportunity to make good work. \\nSecond, said I took the lead in organizing the case. \\nI said: I did not take the lead in organizing activities. The return letter written by the Central Cultural Revolution to Sichuan Province was Li Quanrong, Peng mutao Mutao, Wang Xueqi and others. No one was elected. If you call out any one of your hands and choose me, I confess that he said, 'You are recognized as the head of everyone. \\nThird, want me to hand over the empty background. \\nThe judge also said: According to our opinion, several of you were very born and young, and should have no hatred of the party against the people. Just some people behind you, reactionary thoughts, want to take advantage of the opportunity to turn the case, and strongly support you, you have come to them, you give them up, that is, acting on the initiative, we Will be lenient with you. I replied, 'No, we just wrote a few complaints, a little pen and ink lawsuit, and we did not engage in any counter-revolutionary activities. Someone who dared to submit complaints, we did not have any background.' \\nHe said I was stubborn and would be severely punished. \\nFinally, I sentenced me to 20 years for the first offender, 18 years for Li Quanrong, and Wang Xueqi and Li Bingjie each for 10 years.\\nThe rest were worn back to the right hats, pay unit control, and the city's public public tour shows. \\nLater, this incident forced several of our families to be separated from their wives and broken homes. Three minor daughters of Wang Xueqi's family were all raped by social hooligans, and their husband was arrested to death in prison for supporting her case. Peng mutao Mutao's 70s old mother died angry, and loved ones were forced to divorce, son in society, detained and changed their names. Li Quanrong's lover was forced to divorce and marry, and his son hugged to others. Li Bingjie, his father was angry, big sister mad, unable to work for a long time, could not take care of his own life, brothers and sisters have no contact. Jiang Shisen, mother is angry, fiancée divorced. \\nImmediately in the city to carry out the 'one dozen and three counter-' campaign, 'cleaning class team', the units, the district, the streets, the internal investigation and foreign tune, the fierce fights, the city's right-wing elements were killed, injured, maimed, and suicidal fled, even more unknown. \\nThis is really what they are holding power, can go out, turn their hands into the cloud, cover them for rain. Once again, we were deceived. \\nGrass Kan life, people's life and death by the official\\nIt was only in 1978 when the Central Central Committee set up and cleared the wrong cases, the Xicheng District People's Court of Chengdu City declared in January 1979 that: 'It is now clear that people like Peng mutao Mutao, Li Quanrong and Li Bingjie were classified as right-wing issues in 1957 in the Cultural Revolution. It is permissible to make complaints to party and political leadership organs at all levels., Not to be criminalized, after 1970, to the right The group's convictions, respectively, to prison sentences for Peng mutaomutau et al., and wearing the right hat, were erroneous and acquitted accordingly.' \\nYou see how easy they say, dashing, free, casual, and casually, the life and death of more than 30 family members are in their mastery. You can sometimes say that you 'appeal' is insisting on the reactionary position, taking the opportunity to reverse the case and attempting to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship, and should be 'strictly punished'; at times, it can be said that The complaint is 'permissible' and 'not punishable' acquitted, as can be seen by the word , All because they want, change and change, they can play people's life and death in the palm of their hands. It is really a pen like a knife. This is the typical example of the law serving politics, the lives of grass and the lives of the people. \\nHowever, the dead are not alive, and the lost youth will never be recovered. This loss can never be compensated. The only hope is that things like this will never be repeated again. \\n(Source: Wuliu Village Guide)\\nPAGE 10"}

However, there are already Miao autonomous prefectures in Xiangxi, so there are two kinds of ideas about the form of autonomy for the Tujia family: first, joint autonomy with the Miao and the first is independent autonomy for the Turkish family. Two ideas, two sets of options, each of which is difficult to unify at a time. He left Guangxi to Hunan under the mobilization of Zhou Feng, the Hunan Provincial Government, the United Front Department of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Guangxi Civil Affairs Committee. After expressing the view on the form of regional autonomy for the Tujia nation: 'Since it is considered a single people and predominantly residing in several counties in the northwest, it is possible to establish a separate state in order to manage the internal affairs of their own people according to their own characteristics, in order to facilitate the realization of the ownership of the indigenous people.' It is proposed that a larger delegation be organized by the province, in order to listen to the views of the people in the Tujia populated areas and decide on the form of autonomy of the Turkian community in accordance with the wishes of the majority. Speaking at the Third Plenary Session of the First Third Plenary Session of Hunan Province, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the issue of Turkian regional autonomy. The full text was published in the New Hunan newspaper, which has a wide impact throughout the province. The province adopted the proposal to set up a delegation of the Turkish family in Xiangxi. As one of the deputy heads, led a group to carry out a focused investigation visit to Baojing County, his hometown. A thematic report and a synthesis report were prepared through an in-depth study of the characteristics of the Turkish people, and the delegation's mission reiterated its recommendation that the Turkish family should establish a separate state. The anti-right movement began to learn from the newspaper that Pan Guangdan, etc., had been shocked, suppressed the inner shock and impairment, worked earnestly and persisted with his views, thereby causing fire. Not allowed to attend the delegation's briefing, and then was criticized at the meeting of the Provincial Committee of the CPPCC: 'First, it was his speech at the Provincial Committee of the CPPCC in May this year, with the title of 18 words long, that is his '18-word policy', which is anti-party anti-socialism, and creates a major toxic herb of ethnic division; second, this trip to Xiangxi, he advocated the establishment of the Turkish Autonomous Oblast alone, which was a great exposure to his personal ambitions. Pempo is concerned about ethnic issues is false, so personal ambitions are true. The delegates attending today will have to write a critical statement in two days. Get the gunpowder ready to fire on Pempar!' The new Hunan newspaper reported that the '21 extended meetings of the Provincial People's Committee had proposed the establishment of Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture' was the subtopic of 'The meeting uncovered and criticized Pempo's provoking relations between the Tujia and Miao people and the ethnic unity of the Tujia and Tujia people and the bad behavior of undermining the prestige of the Party and the government.' In the editorial 'Wishing the Great Unity of the Tujia and Miao People', it criticized 'right-wing elements, Pan Guangdan and others who have carefully used ethnic issues to carry out anti-party conspiracies against the people.' In addition to the leaders of the Xiangxi autonomous prefecture and county representatives, some Turkish cadres and university students in Changsha were held at the provincial CPPCC. I have the question: 'Do you advocate independent autonomy for the Tujia, do you want the Turkish family to split out from the motherland and want to create a Turkian independent kingdom? Do you want to be a toast?' Beaten as right-wing elements and escorted back to the country. For a time, the vast majority of the Tujia intellectuals such as Yongshun, Longshan, Baojing and other Tujia intellectuals such as Yongshun, Longshan, Baojing, etc. According to statistics, 208 people in Xiangxi have been hit as right-wing elements because of their objections to the Turkish family form of regional autonomy. First of all, Pan Guangdan and Xiangda suggested in his 'Winter Inspection' speech that because of the long-standing gap between the Hmong and the Turkish family, the prospect of partition for close cooperation may be greater than joint governance. This is just a set of options offered by the two scholars to policymakers. Unfortunately, Hunan Province lacked cautious attitude towards the idea of establishing a separate state, did not carefully analyze the background of such claims, nor did it treat those holding such claims correctly. Instead, they used the 'left' point of view to analyze and judge. Finally, the outline was 'conspiracy', 'ethnic division', 'independence', and the ambassador. People who called for the Turkish clan were cracked against persecution and 'Winter Inspect' was treated as a fallacy on ethnic issues Criticism and liquidation. From the Ministry of Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to various parts of Xiangxi, the so-called 'fact that right-wing elements, Pan Guangdan, have used anti-party anti-people activities on ethnic issues' have been further criticized. Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture was founded on September 20, it turned out to be the culmination of the critical struggle of Pan Guangdan. Separate state-building and joint statehood are watershed, arguing that the former is the wrong route, and that the latter is the right route."},

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached 1] Majie: 'Crushing the Offences of Rightists on Ethnic Regional Autonomy' (National Unity, No. 2, 1957)\\nThe policy of national regional autonomy is one of the fundamental policies of the Chinese Communist Party of China, which is set forth in our Constitution. Over the past few years, the implementation of the policy of national regional autonomy has strengthened unity among ethnic groups and promoted the development of all nationalities, and has thus been wholeheartedly supported by the peoples of all ethnic groups. However, in the party's campaign of rectification, it can be seen that many people in ethnic minorities hold local nationalist views and have various incorrect perceptions of the policy of national regional autonomy, while some minority right-wing elements take advantage of this situation to show to the party on the issue of ethnic regional autonomy Open a crazy attack. \\nOn the issue of regional autonomy for the Tujia community, Peng Po, a Hunan Tujia right-wing activist, tried to provoke the relationship between the Tujia and Miao ethnic groups, instigated some Tujia cadres and intellectuals, oppose the joint establishment of the autonomous prefecture by the Tujia and Miao ethnic groups, demanding 'independent autonomy', and carried out a series of anti-party activities. He denies the Party's leadership of the Tujia people, slanded such leadership as 'the rule of the Han ethnic'. Therefore, he instigated student strikes, put forward anti-party slogans such as 'Down the Land Committee' and 'Down County Committee', and falsified 'public opinion', wrote letters to the Central Committee and Hunan Province, and even openly declared to the masses that the Turkish family's self The cure was his 'indomitable struggle.' Therefore, when they set up autonomous prefectures, they want the right-wing elements to go to Governor Dadang and Pempo as deputy governor, and then the right-wing, Pan Guangdan, as honorary president, when they set up autonomous regions in the future. They openly provoke ethnic relations, saying that the Party's policy is 'heavy and light soil', saying what 'the Turkish family ruled the Miao before liberation, and now the Hmong ruled the Tujia family.' Through these activities, they seek to achieve their separatist national unity, 'regional autonomy' controlled by right-wing elements, contrary to the interests of the people of various nationalities in Xiangxi and not to be led by the Party. \\nThe reactionary group headed by Wang Tianxi, a pseudo commander of the Kuomintang era and a right-wing member of the Dong ethnic group in Guizhou, also secretly organized the so-called 'Xiang, Qian and Gui Autonomous Committee' in early May this year, calling for the establishment of a Dong Autonomous Prefecture across three provinces of Guizhou, Hunan and Guangxi. He attacked our party cannot lead Ethnic minorities, creating the fallacy of 'Han, Miao and Dong status unequal' Those Dong cadres who do not want to associate with him are 'national traitors'. He attempted to become governor after the establishment of the Dong Autonomous Prefecture and occupy the place as 'the capital for bargaining from the Communist Party after the outbreak of the Third World War.' \\nOn the issue of Daur autonomy, the Daur right-wing member, Brin, has unjustifiably demanded the establishment of a Daur autonomous prefecture in an area connected to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Heilongjiang Province, in order to achieve his sinister objectives, disregarding all conditions. He used various means to provoke relations between the masses and the party, and to incite the masses to grievance with the party. Moreover, they used 'national leaders' to occupy themselves, pulling together a group of people with the vile means of Feng Guan Xu Jue, encouraging the establishment of an autonomous prefecture everywhere. He also maliciously provoked the solidarity between the Daur and the Mongolian people, saying that 'the Mongolian people want to assimilate the Dauers'. In order to achieve the goal of promotion, they even have to block the socialist cause of the Daur people, saying 'In order to self-government, the Daur people go for a few years of socialism.' \\nFrom the three examples mentioned above, the attacks by right-wing elements on the policy of national regional autonomy can be summarized as follows:\\nFirst, stigmatize and negate the leadership of the party and spread its influence among the nation as if the party did not care about the equal rights of ethnic minorities and did not actively help ethnic minorities to achieve ethnic regional autonomy, but asked their right-wing elements to 'struggle'. \\n2. Attempts to tamper with the nature of the regime in areas of national self-government, to establish the rule of the bourgeois of landlords in areas of national self-government, to exclude their own revolutionary and Han cadres, and seek to expand their sphere of influence. \\n3. Undermining the unity and cooperation of all nationalities in areas of national self-government. Emphasizing the historical discord and ethnic divide between nations, trying to isolate their own people and practise 'alone'. \\nIt can be seen from here that the right-wing elements are very vicious, attacking the party's ethnic and regional autonomy policy on several fundamental issues. We must respond to the attacks of the right-wing elements. \\nThe policy of national regional autonomy was formulated by the Communist Party of China on the basis of Marxism's Leninist principle of resolving ethnic issues and the actual situation of our nation's ethnic problems. Therefore, the Party adopts this policy in order to guarantee that all ethnic minorities enjoy equal rights of the nation within the unified motherland family, achieve national unity and cooperation, and achieve common development and common prosperity of the nation. As a result of the long history of contacts among our ethnic groups, the distribution of multi-ethnic heterogeneity has been created. One of the superiority of the system of national regional autonomy lies in its ability to guarantee the right to self-government for all minorities with a certain inhabited area. A people can establish autonomous areas in that populated area or in other populated areas. To date, more than 90 per cent of the population of the country has exercised regional autonomy in areas with ethnic regional autonomy. \\nIsn't things very obvious? If it were not under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, there would be no national regional autonomy. The right of minorities to take ownership of their own affairs was realized under the leadership of the Communist Party. The implementation of the party's established policies is of course, why do you need right-wing elements to fight. The issue of autonomy of the Turkish family has been taken into account since the date on which the ethnic composition of the Tujia people was determined. The Party raised this issue to actively consult with the Miao and Tujia in Xiangxi. The Dong people of the sub-offices in the provinces of Xiang, Gui and Qianqian have established separate autonomous areas in the past few years. Therefore, they have not been merged to implement regional autonomy because they take into account the division of the long-term administrative divisions, which makes little contact between the Dong people in the three provinces. On the contrary, they and the ethnic groups in the provinces in which they are located, Both economically and culturally, have established close ties, if in the current situation the three provinces are barely brought together The establishment of autonomous places together is not good for the development of the Dong people. The Daur ethnic group has more than 43,000 people, distributed in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Heilongjiang Province and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. It is basically mixed with other nationalities or diaspora among other nationalities. Only in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Molidawa Flag population is more concentrated, accounting for 33% of the total flag population. The district party committee had long proposed the establishment of a Daur autonomous county in the Molidawa flag. These positive measures taken by the party to realize the right to regional autonomy of all ethnic groups cannot be defamated by right-wing elements. \\nMy country is a working-class led people's democracy based on the Union of Industry and Agriculture. Naturally, the autonomous organ of a national autonomous place under the unified authority of the central authority has to be the people's democratic regime. However, the right-wing elements are trying to tamper with this nature of the local government of national self-government. On the one hand, they conspire to engage some national cadres and seal officials Xu Jue on the one hand, while excluding their own and Han communist cadres. We know that there cannot be no communist cadres in the national autonomous organs, excluding communist cadres, that is, excluding the leadership of the Communist Party, because the Party is through its members to achieve the leadership of the Party. Only by relying on the leadership of the Party can all nationalities develop and prosper, and there is no national autonomous place under the leadership of the Communist Party. What kind of autonomy is that? Isn't it the world of the landlord's bourgeois? Attempts by the right-wing elements to restore the rule of the exploitative class are absolutely unacceptable and, indeed, never achievable by the peoples of the country. This is nothing more than the delusions of the right-wing. \\nThe right-wing elements, based on their ambitions, are also futile to seek to expand the scope of national autonomous areas and improve their administrative status. The size of the autonomous areas of each ethnic group is determined on the basis of local ethnic relations, economic development conditions, and historical circumstances. Adjustment is sometimes necessary because of developments and changes in conditions. However, it is often contrary to the interests of the peoples concerned to widen the scope of national self-government without regard to these conditions. In the autonomous region, which the Nadhaur right-wing activist Brin called for, the Daur population is only 2 per cent of the local population within the limits of his designation, could it be said to be consistent with the principle of ethnic equality if such an autonomous state had been established? This is clearly unequal. This unjustified demand for disregard for the rights of other peoples is a logical development of nationalism, and the reactionary nature of nationalism can be seen here. \\nThe unity and cooperation of all peoples is an important guarantee of success in building socialism in our country. This is true not only at the national level, but also in areas of national self-government, where development is impossible without the unity and cooperation of all nationalities. The unity and cooperation of all peoples in our country are the new national relations that emerged after the elimination of our system of ethnic oppression. This relationship has gained a new foundation in the socialist reform and socialist construction and has been greatly developed. \\nThe rightists are concerned not with the development of peoples and their own peoples, but how to achieve their selfish interests. Therefore, they are doing everything to exaggerate historical ethnic oppression and national alienation, incite nationalism among their peoples, undermine national unity and lead them to the path of isolation. The activities of the right-wing, Pempo, are a typical example of this. There are 380,000 people in Xiangxi Tujia. They intersect with local Miao and Han ethnic groups. In terms of distribution, in addition to Longshan and Yongshun, the two counties of Xiangxi are the main areas of Tujia and Jishou, Huayuan and Fenghuang three counties, there are more than 200,000 Tujia and Miao communities that are mixed with each other.. Joint autonomy is desirable in the light of the inseparable inseparability between the residential and economic and cultural aspects of the Tujia and Miao communities in Xiangxi. More than 99 per cent of the Tujia people are in favour of establishing autonomous prefectures jointly with the Hmong people, while the right-wing Phompoh and others are biased against the coalition, insist on division, and establish the Turkian Autonomous Prefecture alone. What would be the result if their plans were sold? That is, both the Miao people in the Tujia Autonomous Prefecture and the Tujia people in the Hmong Autonomous Prefecture will be placed outside their own autonomous areas. Not to mention the consequences of this artificial division in the construction cause and people's lives, that is, politically, a part of the Turki people's right to national and regional autonomy has been denied to the right, such as Pempo. Isn't it very clear that rightists fake the rights and interests of the nation, and the interests of the owners of the bourgeois? \\nIt is important to note that historically inter-ethnic discord and divides were created by the reactionary ruling class at that time. But it was in the past era of ethnic oppression that economic cooperation and cultural exchanges had been developed among peoples. The evil of the right-wing elements is that they deliberately exaggerate the previous aspect of history's national relations, erase the latter, and describe ethnic oppression from the reactionary ruling class as oppression by one people against another, thereby creating national antagonism, poison and destroying today's peoples Brotherhood between. \\nIt is not possible to uncover and criticize all the right-wing attacks on regional autonomy, but only in part of what is revealed here is enough to arouse our deep alarm. Once the right elements attempt to use the party's policy of ethnic regional autonomy to usurp the party's leadership in areas of national self-government and to use ethnic autonomy as the place where they accumulate their strength, the time will never come (of course, this time will never come.), They will act against them. Isn't Wang Tianxi confessed so clearly? \\nThe lesson to be drawn from the attacks of the right-wing elements is to firmly uphold the Party's policy of national and regional autonomy, constantly strengthen the unity of all nationalities and consolidate the unity of the motherland. At the same time, nationalism should be resolutely opposed and overcome so that right-wing elements, whether in the Han or ethnic minorities, have no room for their feet if they do not take care of their minds.

His original name is Peng Sichun, born in April 1912 in Dongjiachong, a poor vegetable farmer family in Baojing County, Hunan Province. For his father's early death, he and his brother were raised by the mother. \\nIn 1926, young Pengpo was admitted to the second teachers of Changde Province, and had frequent contact with the students studying at the school Communist Party members Su Yu, Teng Daiyuan, Hu Mingzhen, Teng Jiuzhong, and Teng Jiuzhong, and introduced by Teng Jiuzhong and Hu Mingzhen to join the Communist Youth League. In the 'Ma Day Incident', he was arrested in prison for covering the Communist Party such as Muyu and Teng Daiyuan fleeing the tiger mouth.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attachment 3] Ding Shu: 'Naming and Others' (Manuscript)\\nThe name of the 'Tujia':\\nThe Tujia family is a 'quasi-bilingual nation', with the majority (99%), renouncing their own language and devoting themselves to the common language of other nationalities, namely, Chinese; a small number (1%), maintain their own language, Tujia. The ethnic name of the Tujia also tends to be 'double', with both a Turkish-language self-proclaimed and a Chinese language. The Tujia people call themselves 'Bizka' or 'Bijica' in Tujia, and 'Tujia' to foreign communities; both internally and externally, call themselves 'Pizka' when communicating in Tujia, and 'Tujia' when communicating in Chinese. \\nOn January 3, 1957, the United Front Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), '507\\ issued to the United Front Department of Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan and Guizhou Provincial Committee, confirming the Tujia family as a single nation. Since then, the 'Turkish family', as a legal clan of the Turkish family, has spoken of all forms of official documents and public places, while the 'Bizka' is used only in folk or academic writings. \\nOrigin of the name 'Bizka':\\nIn Tujia, 'Pizka' is a composite word consisting of 'Biz' and 'card', 'Biz' is the family name of double syllables, and it is difficult to accurately interpret its meaning, 'card' refers to 'human family'. In Tujia, Han is called 'Paka', called the Miao as 'Burka'. Both 'Pa' or 'Bok' are single-syllables, but it is difficult to understand the meaning of 'Pa' or 'Bok'. \\nOrigin of the name of 'Tujia':\\nAround Tang Dynasty, Hanwen and ancient literature generally referred to all ethnic minorities in China as 'baran', and called the Southern minorities 'Nanban'. And often to place names crown city class. Such as 'Wuling Man' 'Li Zhong Man' 'Wu Yang Man' 'Wuxi Man' 'Yuzhou Man' 'Youyang Man' 'Peng Shui-Man' 'Yidu Man' 'Shizhou Man' 'Gaozhou Man' 'Chenzhou Man' 'Xizhou Man' 'Shimen Man' and so on, is to Xiang, E, Chuan, Qian, Chongqing and many other places including Tujia The general name of the nation. In the Song Dynasty, the literature contains names such as 'patrons, toots,' and other names, literally 'rude' generation, probably in order to avoid serious emotional antagonism. The 'soil' here refers not exclusively to the Turkish family, but to many ethnic groups in the same region, including the Turkish family. Three generations of Yuanming and Qing Dynasty, the toast system was implemented in the Tujia area, and the local history appeared with the name of 'Turkish' Hu people, such as 'soldiers, indigenous people, Turkish chiefs, Turkish barbs' and so on. Among them, the 'tandal', is the origin of the Chinese name of the 'Turkish family' in the category of 'town-man' to 'baran'. \\nDuring the Qing Dynasty 'replacements' into the Republic, large numbers of Han and other nationalities moved to the Tujia district, further forming the multi-ethnic pattern of the region. As a result, the titles of 'Tuk, Hakka, Miao Min', 'Tujia, Hakka, Miao Jia' and other titles have gradually been opened. For many years, in the minds of Tujia and other nationalities, 'Tujia' has been the Chinese language of the Tujia. \\nTujia Source-'Multi-Origin Theory' of the Puzzled House of Roots\\nThe Pakistani said, Wu Man said, the indigenous said, Xiange Tujia homogenous saying, Qiang said, Fuxi said, slaughi said, Puren said, Jiangxi, and so on, and so on. \\nBaren said: Professor Pan Guangdan of the former Central Institute for Nationalities wrote 'Tujia' and the ancient Palestinian people in 1955, published in the fourth series of Chinese Ethnic Issues, published by the Research Department of the former Central Institute for Nationalities (November 1955): 'Tujia' is not 'miao' or 'fangs' and more than 'Dong' and 'Zhuang', but 'descendants of a part of the ancient Cuban'. (In the second half of 1957, some people proposed that 'the Tujia is one of the Wugan who moved from Guizhou to Xiangxi after Zhongtang,' and openly opposed the Tujia people who had raised opinions and requests for the question of the composition of the Tujia family and 'forms of regional autonomy' such as former Professor of Peking University and National People's Congress Deputies Xiangda, Guangxi Peng po, director of the research department of the Institute of Nationalities, and Ms. Tian Xintao, teacher of Henan Xinxiang Normal University, were classified as 'right-wing '. (We pay tribute to the former who contributed to the legal title of the Tujia family and the autonomy of the Tujia region!), \\nIn 1984, a review conference was held in Changsha during the finalization of the 'Brief History of the Turkish Family', written by Mr. Liu Xiaoyu, of the Central Institute for Nationalities, and by Mr. Wang Jubao of the Central Institute for Nationalities. The results agreed that the views of the same origin and slaughter said still belong to the Pakistans said, while Qiang said, Fuxi said, is the source of the upper Sumba people. As for the Puren saying that insufficient arguments are not listed as one. Jiangxi, on the other hand, is from folk genealogy and oral legends. So in April 1986, published by the Hunan People's Publishing House, the Tujia Brief History on the 'origin of the Tujia family' recorded the following three statements:\\nOne said 'The Turkish family is the descendant of the ancient Cuban people'. Some of the geographical names, names and ethnic names in the areas where the ancient Pakistanis are active, are tones or transposes of the Turkish family calling themselves 'Bizz'; the Pakistani worship of the White Tiger is the same as the Turkish family; the primary family name of the Pakistani people has an inherited relationship with some of the Turkish family names; and individual Pakistani words remain in today's Tujia language. \\nOne said, 'Xiangxi Tujia is a fusion of ancient Xiangxi indigenous people and the Pakistani and Han people who have entered.' The authors believe that Neolithic cultural sites found in Liye, Luxi Lipu City, and Dayong County, are the earliest indigenous ancestors living in Xiangxi. The Turkish family calls themselves 'Bizka', meaning the native people, is native. The native language 'Mecha' means open heaven, and 'Riye' means land, meaning that these places were the first to be opened up by indigenous ancestors. 'Timma' (the name of the witcher in Tujia), God's singing words mentioned in the national migration place, as far as 'Shibi Dong', 'Stone Road', did not cross the confluence of the Yuanjiang River and water. The Pakistans who had flowed into Wuxi after Qin died and Pengshi, Jiangxi, who stayed in Xiangxi in the five generations, integrated the title of the Tujia family with the earliest indigenous people in the region. \\nOne said, 'The Tujia was moved from the area of Guizhou.' According to the 'Fuxi State copper column' contained: 'cover smell of the site, dispersion of the wind, because six sons separated, into Wuxi and gathered.' Think Tujia is from Guizhou. Guizhou has always had the name of 'Bizi', Biji (Beloro). Bizi, Bizi immediately Bizz, and the present indigenous family claim exactly the same. After Zhongtang, the area of Vietnam, Wugan invaded Guizhou, soldiers numbered, invaded thousands of miles, the local indigenous part was conquered, is the origin of the Bailuo title; part of the long-term struggle with them, finally forced to move into Xiangxi; the indigenous family and the Yi people are close. This said that the Turkish family was formed by a fusion of indigenous and Pakistani people. \\nThree said after the formation, the majority of researchers did not meet this. Three says 'multi-source theory', while the source or primary source or primary root of the Turkish family can only have one, not more than one. So after refusing the three statements, it was found that there are many inaccuracies and inadequacies. The statement is also very general and even far-fetched. \\nAs a result, the arguments of divergence and three statements cannot determine the main source of the Turkish family. Where did the main source of the Tubes come from? \\nPeople-the main source of the Tujia\\n(cong), people, also known as plank brute, learned from all kinds of historical materials, people called 'giving' as '', and was called 'man', this is he called; also in the war with wooden board as 'shield', he also called 'slab brute'. An indigenous tribe operating on the border between Cuba and Chu. According to the 'public land jisheng', they had established a capital in the center of the overlapping mountains and dangerous terrain (now northeast of Dangqu County, Sichuan Province). It had the place name of the city. The activities of the people are more specific in the 'Huayang Guozhi' and 'Post-Chinese Book'. 'After the Chinese Book' (Vol. 86), 'South West of the South Banan' said: 'The barbaric, Qin Zhaoxiang Wang had a white tiger, often from the group of tigers to the land of Qin, Shu, Pakistan, Han, hurt more than a thousand people. Zhao Wang is heavy in the country can kill tiger, view Yi Wan, Jin Baiyi. Ba County Langzhong Yi people, can be a white crossbow, naiden building shot white tiger. Zhao Wang Jia-zhi, and with its people, do not want to seal, but carved stone union, flush people are not rented, ten wives do not fall, the wounding, the murderer can redeem money to death. Meng said: 'Qin offyi, loses a pair of Huanglong; Yi-sin Qin, lose one hour of sake. Ray people's peace. To Gao Zu for the Han King, Fayi people still waved Qin land, and redemption, Yu Hudai earned money, mouth 40. The world number is the Panjiki.' \\nFrom a comparative study from the post-study, the Turkish family and the Chinese people have the same similarities in eight aspects such as self-proclaimed, language, customs, etc., basically clearly that the Tujia family is a descendant of the ancient people.

You want to see, no door! \\nI have repeatedly visited ancient houses, people went to the building empty, and went to the building of the Democratic Party (eight democratic party municipal committee organs, better than a street or town office building), I did not know their ancestors, let alone tell them where their children were. But my impressions come to life, like Zhang Taiyan and the wax statues in Zhang Cangshui Memorial Museum still tell me:\\nPeng ruilin: Zhejiang provincial cadres big right, Sha, Yang, Peng, and Sun ranked the third executive class, is a pious communist who spent 18 years in the Kuomintang prison. Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou personally came to Hangzhou to draw the right, farm transformation than my young right-wing, rickets every day-He told me he was Jiang Hua (first secretary of the CPC Provincial Committee), who came down with his hands in the field Caught a group of manure sprinkled onto a root, living in the shack is full of manure smell, only I wait for hard friends to sniff think can adapt. My appetite is odd, 16 two scales a day have cooked food 20 or two (including melon dishes), only enough to eat a meal and a half full, into my stomach called tiger licking butterfly; so often go to Penglao Farm (Tianmu Mountains around several counties to do dozens of labour, re-education, educated green farm), distance between 10 and 20 Well counted. (A), to the educated youth as a negative teaching material, heavy live and dirty work by the right, some young people do not obey, the ore machine received the enemy radio quietly rumors, that the chaos were just like the right; (2), also assigned a good composition of the educated youth to supervise the right, called Sanhong Bao, one black), to seek charity, of course, good weather, After work after work, I ran at the night, I ran at Pingshan farm, he was in the Panyu farm, just walk the sheep intestine trail to turn three Hills can nearly half the road. Penglao stomach disease seriously eat very little but dry work, the house has a lot of things to eat, these are his leftovers or pick back from the field 'small radish small ru like, I do not choose food, all raw cooked into his mouth to eat, but also like desperately Sanlang stone show to make a bag bare back on the shoulder, I Although it was a granite head, I still gave some food to ginger Shaoli, the right wing of the hat picking, and I could survive that year without puffiness. Peng's gift will never forget. \\n1977 old ancestors have died for more than a year, at this time I changed my identity-pick the right hand in the silk weaving factory dry pull truck, often go to his place to visit (timely live Pacific cinema opposite Minghu pool bathroom bungalow black and broken), Peng old often miss his son in Heilongjiang fire rescue and sacrifice, advanced Traces must not be publicized, martyrs can not be on the list. Speaking of this time, the two lines of old tears Flowing down, wiped with corners of broken glasses lenses hate is to hurt his son. But I took only the hawthorn fruit from Shandong on his table. Immediately he went to the house to come up with a booklet, which was a Central Party School publication. \\n'Xiao Ding, show you a material, is Yao Bang's speech.' Peng Lao said with joy. \\nThe speech of the then Central Group Minister Hu Yaobang, said that the People's Daily and Xinhua News Agency did not publish it, but could only be published in internal journals in the name of academic dynamics. The content was mainly 'human heart' and the narrative of the wrong case. I was attracted by the words that affect my own destiny, and clearly remember the original words. We are going to rectify ten, twenty, and thirty years of wrongs...' Without copying, Peng Lao's house is very dark and can not be transcribed. \\nI said with excitement, 'Peng Lao, if implemented in these words, ten years refers to the Cultural Revolution. Twenty years are our old right, and thirty years is not the turn of Hu Feng?' \\n'Well, Yaobang has the courage, it is quite possible, but the resistance is heavy,' Peng said. \\n'What about your old eight cadres repaying a lot of wages?' \\n'If there is this day, I pay the party fee entirely.' \\nThe heart of an old cadre of an old party member has been the right-wing for 20 years, with no regrets, making me a small party member, the small right. Talking between a police officer at the lakeside police station came to his door, weighing us (three right-the big right pengruilin, middle right ginger Shaoli, small right count me), saw the foot from the head, to not take away where asked, he put a big cap and said, 'Hey, which is Pengruilin.' \\n'Is it me, what do you look for him?' \\n'Your son has a shotgun, and today must come to his place, yo! Qiosescu wants to come to Hangzhou, understand?' Eyeing, its momentum is telling us that it is not enough to reflect the majesty of the people's police to deter class enemies. \\n'Yes, understand, I must call the child back and pay the shotgun.' Bending 90 degrees waist Vino. Ah, 20 years of farm transformation, an anti-Japanese veteran eight cadres have been so tamed, thanks to the great mentor, great leader, great commander, and great navigator Mao Zedong. \\nThe civilian police were all the same in the Cultural Revolution. I pulled me for my adult dependent life sick in bed, day and night hoping that my singles would not be able to feed her mouth porridge in front of her bed. I had to cry in front of the farm secretary Dong for three days (during the same period, Medical University (Brother Youren Jun is also a mother's disease with me at the same time), as he secretary Dong pointed to the nose scolded: \\n'I run your grandmother, this thing, that thing, what kind of thing do you have to take leave, and finally I wept sad to impress him, and I laugh: 'Look, you two boys, who call you to be the right? Good people do not want to be the right, I do your grandmother.' After listening to the bitterness and verbal abuse of each person leave three days \\nWhen I arrived home, my grandma saw me wearing grass shoes and cried immediately, tears were raining, just sat down, and had not yet had a drink of water. Director of Protection came in with the police, first searched my bag (or sent by the army), and then asked me: 'My name, how can you come back to Hangzhou?' \\n'Why can't my home come back, I have leave!' Although the police were very ferocious, I was not as obedient as Peng Lao, but I was helpless because they were full of leave and asked them to sign back off. If unlucky encountered these three days anti-label to take my hand print to check. \\nThe police said fiercely again, 'Your account has been moved to the farm. It is no longer a Hangzhou man, you know?' \\nAlas, there is no return to the country. \\nYang Siyi, Fu governor, four top right ranks second, is the main leader of the Jinxiao detachment of the new four armed forces of Zhejiang East, and his wife Zhang Wenjun is the cadre of the political trial organization developing my party members. (Hu Mo and Weng Huizhen of the four female cadres also crossed the right to complete 50%,), Yang saw the 'Zhejiang Daily' banner title in the hospital bed 'Sand, Yang, Peng, Sun Da Right' great triumph laughed and swallowed from In another sense, he was lucky and spared 22 years of tribulation. \\nShawenhan, governor, Sha, Yang, Peng and Sun ranked the first, when he was seriously ill, announced the cap-picking, just click the head to stop breathing. Failed to be on the right. His wife Chen Xiuliang is the main leader of the Nanjing Shanghai Underground Party and Pan Hannian (dedicating all his property to the revolutionary cause), for his life as the party fought for the party, in the end ended up miserable, and a whole group of people sweeped out for defending the law of the party; the whole person promoted to create for themselves Happy escape environment, all day by the beauty accompany mahjong (is to work office), accompany the bath rub, which little girl Dare, some of the children who can be educated after their parents have been grabbed on the right have been inexhaustible. \\nThe target of the United War, designated as the old right, the Great Right:\\nMa Wenche, a senior general of the KMT's northwest Ma Jiajun, the KMT preferred the governor. After the uprising, in order to rely on the Communist Party, dedicate to the government the villa of the small wife of Wanpongling under Jade Emperor Mountain on the West Lake. He only arranged for him to spare a vice chairman of the Hangzhou branch of the People's Relief Association of China's People's Relief Association (PRC), in Hangzhou. Cooked Lenin's 'two steps further', believing that hepatobile photo and hit the 'conspiracy', a A villa white sent a big right;\\nDu Wei, a senior member of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee and Li Jishen, served as head of the Department of Civil Affairs of Zhejiang Province of the Republic of China. After the uprising, only director of the funeral industry committee, Du Lao is also the director of the Buddhist Association. Every day, he does not learn nothing from a lack of morality, but only to play a woman who knows only one liter of Ma Peilong Three eight style〉a cold bench called the Director General, and also caught the conspiracy. One day, I met in Xiaoying Lane (the Holy Land where Chairman Mao visited), public toilet, see four nobody, I respectfully asked the place:\\n'Director Du, how do you the whole family right, son and me, come down into Peking University, and daughter-son-in-law masses art museum to the right.' \\nHe replied, 'Yes, you're a little communist party, also be careful' where he knows I transferred to dry school than him. I remember that this day was two days off the National Day, that is September 29. Just hide him. \\nI asked again: 'I heard that Chairman Mao had a serious illness and that the internal health bulletin had also come out, you know?' \\n'Create a rumor, kill his head.' He ran busy to the small hall. In the Kuomintang official field for decades, with Huang Shaoxiong, Shen Honglie, Chen Yi, he went up for many years with the stone, Zhang Zhizhong, Chen Lifu and Chen Guofu. A right-wing hat shocked him so horrified and discouraged, thus showing the power of the reverse right. \\nProfessor Chen Shimin, members of the NLD and Ma Yinchu are a hometown of Shengxian County, very much like me, often called me to come to his villa where he flocked into Lake Mensiz. The young lady took me as a daughter, and cried out 'A sister', she was not enough, more than thirty. I learned from the mouth of the professor that Mao Zedong's message at the First National People's Congress was hanging in the hall in large square characters, paving for more than a month. And at the opening session, the first sentence: 'Comrades,' the title of 'comrades' was a dog-ass, limited literature, he told me that it was Song. Yun Bin personally attended the meeting and heard that in the Zhejiang NLD laughter, the disclosure was particularly high, and also became the Great Right, and Song Yunbin dig to the right of Huang Yuan in the Lu Xun era.' \\nThe above Ma, Du, Chen, and Song Ben were friends who had deep diplomatic relations. They were photographed by each other to expose criticism and blame against each other. Until the newspaper announced that the great right did not know that it was not a person, but a guy. From this chicken dog voice, go through the door, each other broken hats over the city, mud Buddha across the river. \\nAt that time, many students denounced the teacher, but I did not sign the word. During the same period, Shao Yanxiang was wrong to see the seedlings in the disaster, and even wrote long poems 'adults and gentlemen... criticizing Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiji, etc.; Deng Youmei came to power to expose Liu Shaotang and Vihee's anti-party crimes. My old man in Zhejiang Chen Xuehao saw bad events, and wrote several articles on the right in a row. I specifically followed her chishan port villa and asked her why the criticizing suggested article turned 180 degrees into a song of charity. He became the 'knife' said by Hu Feng, she said: Xiao Ding, guilty blame, do not make good, do not go back quickly, not good too. Originally, Peng Baishan turned through the wind to her (Peng is the propaganda minister of the East China Bureau), she knows not well, and the desk has filled her own articles. \\nOne day, my principal Gordé (38 rare intellectuals), told me to see the newspapers, pointing to the long poems and essays by Shao Yanxiang and Chen Xuezhao, laughing, 'Do these people also want to get through the border and escape? The list is set to master the Jolai Buddha.' \\nThe president of Goldfu and secretary of the party committee, I feel uncomfortable for him. He told me that the university joined the underground party, participated in the new four army, once the team broke up. He hid in a cave hungry for seven days, and could not, climb in the mouth of the cave, and met a poor girl to cut firewood. With the silver dollar on the body and the girl for cooked beans to eat, found with the help of farmers Troops, the history of leaving the troops for these 15 days has always been a reason not to be reused. Although administrative fourteen cadres, their ability is better than previous municipal committee secretaries, proficient in English and French, but never arranged for a regular position. The deputy principal of the Party School, the Personnel Bureau, the Education Bureau, all the departments in charge are deputy posts, and in order to manifest himself. His loyal and painstaking, always continue 'how to properly deal with the internal contradictions of the people', will be on how to read, six Standard deep understanding, the whole school pulled out 12.4% of the right. \\nO GOD! My esteemed Vice-Chancellor, you carry internal control until your end of life. \\nAh, Mao Zedong, the greatest Maoist of contemporary times, do you call future generations to count your credit, or count your guilt? If you go to Jinggang Mountain, you will remove Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai; death went to Shaanxi North and crowded the leaders there, people for you to eat and wore a cave, you would take the right of Gao Gang, Xi Zhongxun, force Zhang Guotao to die in an exotic, forced Chen Duxiu to die with hate, Li Dazhao would also be killed by you. That, kill Peng Dehuai, He Long, Liu Shaoqi, let you take the throne of God, die deserve it. Dai Che will kill you at the time of the Chongqing negotiations. It is that the Democratic Party will take you off the risk of protecting you; generals of the uprising all want to kill. If it is true as your successor Lin Biao shouted for 'Wanshou No Reins' and conducted a whole person killing campaign in three years, is there still an elite in China? China will retreat to the primitive era of society, your second hobby is to play women, Yang Kaihui Guan in the prison in Changsha, you do not save on the well post play He Zizhen; after the founding of the country hundreds of girls let you spoil. It is a pity that the day does not come from your wish, but only 83 years old is dead and slept. And those who survived by you overturned in the land, more than 90 years old are, woo hoo! \\nWritten on September 9, 2009\\nCommunications Office: Room 17-26-502, Huanxi New Village, Xiacheng District, Hangzhou"}

He said it in memory, not very accurate. This is Stalin's 'On the shortcomings of the Party's work and ways to eliminate the Trotsky and the other two factions', which reads, 'Victory has its dark side as everything in the world.' (Stalin Collection 1934-1952, People's Publishing House, 1985 edition, p. 148)\\nHe began to talk about China's reality from this argument. He said that in recent years, I feel that the dark side is getting wider and deeper. Some things can no longer be explained with so-called 'individual' shortcomings and mistakes. \\nSpeaking of democracy, Peng shenghan said that the essence of democracy lies in absolute freedom of thought (as reflected in our constitutionally freedom of speech, association, assembly), and the organization of minority subordination to the majority (voting for a government). He opposes the distinction between bourgeois democracy and proletarian democracy, arguing that it is non-class in itself. Some people said: 'In the past there were some things that were less democratic and concentrated more, not not undemocratic.' He also said that 'the right ratio between democracy and concentration should be sought in the future', which he felt was playing with terms and tricks. When the past was undemocratic, it should be honest in admitting mistakes. \\nTurning to the issue of counteraction, he believed that rebellion and trial could not be mixed. Counteracting is not against the enemy, but dictatorial to oneself. He disagreed with the saying that 'the fight against the fight is the masses route'. He said, Who is the masses? I divided it into four types: thugs, winds, downwind, and fought. If you want to describe it as a mass route, it's just a 'thuger' route. He said how many happy families have been broken down and how many strong friendships have been destroyed in the fight against them. It is unusual that these things happen in peacetime, and it undermines normal relations between human beings. I think it's all the evil consequences of dogmatism. (Liaoning Daily, June 8)\\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attachment 2】Peng shenghan Shenghan: Speech at the Communist Party Committee of the Communist Party of the Communist Party of China (CPC)\\nI remember seeing Stalin in a journal saying: Great reform must have its dark side. How can this sentence be understood? Someone understands that making mistakes is inevitable and inevitable. I thought this understanding was wrong, because it would be possible to make the dark side narrow, or even not to appear, as long as it was checked frequently. In recent years, I feel that the dark side is getting wider and deeper. Some things can no longer be explained with so-called 'individual' shortcomings and mistakes. \\nDaughter denouncing father is loss of humanity\\nI feel that there are many things that are missing from one thing, and I can't think of a proper name, for the time being called humanity or humanity. Here are some specific facts to illustrate. \\nFor example, Gao Gang and Rao Shushi (first of all I am not sympathetic to Gaogang and Rao Soshi). When the school conveyed the report of the Party Central Committee on the incident, he said: In the end, Gao Gao turned out to mutate the party with suicide. There was a different feeling in the heart at that time. As far as I know, Gao Gang has contributed to the revolution. Before the metamorphosis in 1949, he has been faithful to serving the people. I do not agree with such a person. I feel that the conclusion made by the party to the senior posts is more than serious and painful. We have seen the Three Kingdoms, know the story of 'Kong Ming cut the tears cut Ma Su', I am very admired for the ability of Kong Ming, but I think the reason why he is great is that he is very human. I think the conclusion that the Communist Party has given a high post is devoid of human face. That's why I sound like something different in my heart. \\nAnother example, during the ideological transformation movement, Lu Zhiwei, President of Beijing Yanjing University, was fought. His daughter was called under the stage, 'Shoot him!' I think if he commits sin even if he should be shot, the mood as his daughter must be very painful. In this heavy mood, I can still shout under the stage. Indeed, I cannot understand, at least this is not against my appetite. \\nI remember when my mind was reformed, the newspaper (probably the China Youth Daily), had one thing: to the effect that an individual was trading opium before liberation and continued to trade drugs after liberation, and the government wanted to arrest him, but he didn't know where he hid opium. This man had only one daughter, but his daughter. By deceiving, knowing from her father where opium was hiding, he reported to the government. Her father. There is a good side of this, indicating that his daughter's position is firm, but I think the approach is wrong, and I think she is not 'doing everything.' Why didn't she manage to save her father? Why not persuade him to confess himself? I think this is also a manifestation of the loss of humanity. I think these phenomena are not normal and are against human law. \\nYou should not use the 'bucket' against the enemy.\\nLet me talk about 'bucket' again. Everyone knows very well that fighting their own people should not be. Doing the enemy should not? We hated the brutal inhumane acts of the enemy, like the German fascist acts revealed in the film 'Rome's Undefended City'. But we are not going back and forth to our enemies in this way. Because the people we have nurtured by socialism are humanitarian and human. I think 'bucket' is inhumane and spiritual torture. So I thought not to fight the enemy either. It is said that Khrushchev said: We now add to the enemy, not more than the enemy will add to us (meaning). I don't disagree with that. Because we have the basic principle of being human, can not say that this 'bucket' method is lighter than the enemy can be used, so I basically oppose the 'fight', whether against the enemy or against their own people. It is sad to say how many happy families have been broken down and how many strong friendships have been destroyed by the struggle against rebellion. It is unusual that these things happen in peacetime, and it undermines normal relations between human beings. I think it's all the evil consequences of dogmatism. It is often said that class struggles are inherently cruel. Through the anti-rebellion movement, I feel that the struggle is brutal and partly artificially. My overall feeling is that a lot of things are lacking in humanity now. \\nDemocracy has no class\\nI think that the essence of democracy is to be clarified in two ways. I think that the essence of democracy lies in absolute freedom of thought (manifested in our constitutionally freedom of speech, association, assembly), and the organizational minority subordination to the majority (voting for a government). So if 'democracy' is unorganized, it is distorted. At the same time, I oppose a distinction between bourgeoisie democracy and proletarian democracy. I think that 'democracy' seems like a glass of water, the bourgeois drank in the past, and today it is the people who come to drink. It is not class in itself. Some people say that 'in the past some things were less democratic and more concentrated, not undemocratic'. 'The right ratio between democracy and concentration should be sought in the future', which I think is playing with terms and tricks. When the past was undemocratic, it should be honest in admitting mistakes. \\nIt's the 'thugs route'\\nAbout counteracting. I don't think it is possible to mix rebellions and trials. Some people say that the mistake of counteracting is only to 'shoot the table, gazing eyes' to their own people so hurt feelings. I very disagree, this is the saying that avoiding weight is light, hidden evil and good, and the Annunciation does not report worries. Only dictatorship against the enemy can guarantee democracy, but to whom do we fight against? Not against the enemy, but against oneself. Some people say that the struggle against the fight against the people is the line of the masses. Who is the masses? I divided it into four types: thugs, winds, downwind, and fought. If you want to describe it as a mass route, it's just a 'thuger' route. \\nAt another panel meeting, he advocated the elimination of the term 'anti-revolutionary'\\nOn June 7, Peng shenghan Shenghan, lecturer of Dalian Institute of Technology, said at a panel meeting of the Communist Party of the Communist Party of the Communist Party of China Brigade University: If there is no precise definition of 'counter-revolutionary', the term 'counter-revolutionary' should be eliminated. In his view, there were political prisoners in the old society, and today's counter-revolutionary charges were not free of political belief. He said that a person should have political ideals, and if he does wrong it is another thing. Some people are reactionary, but he does not offend the law cannot be said to be counter-revolutionary. He also said that in today's society there can only be criminal criminals and no other crimes should be committed, so the term 'counter-revolutionary' should be abolished. \\nPeng shenghan Shenghan also said, Su previously he felt very free to speak, but after the anti-opposition movement began, he was very unfree and silenced for two years.

The main reason for this dark side is that many things lack humanity, or the loss of humanity. After the incident of high rao in 1954, he heard a message in the hospital that Gao gang died to mutinize the party. Such a conclusion is that there is no human face and loss of humanity. (Travel University Daily, 6 June)\\nPeng shenghan Shenghan (Lecturer at Dalian Institute of Technology): I heard that when someone in Beijing was fighting, her daughter shouted under the stage, if it was really supposed to shoot him, her daughter's mood must be very painful, and she shouted at the head, I could not look at the appetite of others.

Those who have contributed to the Party. Now it is more serious and painful to say that he is more than serious, not enough, but Kong Ming is waving tears and masu. One of the great places I admire Kong Ming is that he has a human sense, and this conclusion is that he has no human feelings and loses humanity. (6 June), (Liaoning Daily, 8 June)\\nWith regard to counteraction, I do not think that rebellion and trial can be mixed. Some people say that the mistakes of counteraction are only to their own people, 'shooting the table, stare eyes' so hurt feelings. I very disagree with, this is the argument that avoiding weight is light, hidden evil and good, and the Annunciation does not report worries. Only dictatorship against the enemy can guarantee democracy, but to whom do we fight against? Not against the enemy, but against oneself. (Liaoning Daily, June 8)\\n'Since the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of 'hundreds of family disputes, flowers are on the whole' policy, foreign party people have general concerns,' said at a panel meeting of the publicity meeting of the Beijing University Municipal Committee. This is natural, because their personal experience since liberation makes them unconcerned.' 'To the secretary of the municipal committee, he said that in the future the party will only put it, will not receive it. It sounds a little crappy. He said, 'First of all, ask, who gave the power to put Himing? This is not given by the Communist Party, it is constitutional. We want to repress, this is our right, not contrary to the Constitution. The Constitution has been published for more than four years, and now the masses are worried and afraid to exert, indicating that the Constitution has not been implemented very well, and we do not have this right to repress until today. No one can take it, nor can the Communist Party receive it, and it is up to the people to decide, unless the Constitution is amended. It can be seen here that if the people are under the protection of the Constitution, there will be no concerns today, and if the Communist Party is advocating the Constitution, it will not come to answer the question like this.'

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attachment 2] Peng shian Shek An: My main words and deeds (1957.9.24)\\nI think I am mainly from extreme bourgeoisie individualism to the right of the bourgeois, mainly because the personal desires are not satisfied, gradually generating dissatisfaction with the party. I like to look for the dark side and shortcomings of the party, I like to listen to the disadvantages of the party and exaggerate the party's shortcomings. That's how it evolves to become Right. In the whole wind to attack the party, vent my dissatisfaction, my main words and deeds have the following aspects:\\n1. to speak of a mess about the work of the publishing house, simply do not see the achievements, invariably attack the leadership of the publishing house, arrogant call them to go. \\n2. Spread right-wing remarks at the press group, such as 'Democrats have no power', 'each unit puts a Communist member to lead', 'not enough care for non-proletarian intellectuals', 'Party members are not congenital worries, but are innate fun' and so on. \\n3. The nine-point opinion of the anti-party, who actively supported the right-wing, Qian, was openly supporting her in writing a big print newspaper, working for her, and so on. In addition, there was a secret support, mainly to use the opportunity of work to inform her, especially against other people's opinions against money. \\n4. Write a large print that defamates the party. 'Painted Communist Party members,' and so on, knew it was wrong to write these big print papers, but could not restrain this sentiment. I also went to Peking University to copy the reactionary big print and spread distrust of the party both inside and outside the house. My aim was to vent my discontent with the party and my unreformed reactionary and exploitative class ideology. My crime is serious, whether as a national cadre or as a citizen. My words and deeds against the Party were not able to be recovered in one or two years. It was sent out easily to recover it. I am guilty. I owe the debt to the people. Now I ask for sin from the party and the people for punishment. In the future, I will only express my willingness to atonement for a long time with my own practical actions. \\nThe following combination of my right-wing remarks to talk about what I have about the party and its root causes:\\nAt the press rectification group meeting, I said that the leadership looked very high on their glorious revolutionary history, very low to exploitative class youth. They could not see these young people living in a new society from the beginning of their knowledge, which grew up under the leadership of the Party. The intention of my statement was to contest the party's interests and status, exposing the idea of a bourgeois climb up here, that exploitative youth have no future. As long as I find the right, I will climb up with no means, and this idea dominates my actions for a long time. I had a cousin who came out for an hour against a family arranged marriage, joined the Kuomintang army, married a KMT officer and had no knowledge of her messages at home for a long time. I met her in Shanghai in 1952, knowing that her lover was a counter-revolutionary, and was arrested for eight years. imprisonment. I often went to her house to see her, before she showed me the diary of her love with KMT officers. I got to the school. As usual, I should hand it over, but I was always struggling. I was not willing to hand it out in the morning, I wanted to study graduate students, and I was afraid of affecting myself, until the afternoon I gave the regiment book. In the fight against my face of generosity, my heart has not drawn the boundaries between revolutionary and counter-revolutionary. In ideological and emotional terms, I am not very active in the fight against it. I was not satisfied with the party because of the cousin incident. After I handed over the diary, the leaders asked me to write details about cousins. I wrote. Leaders felt enough to ask me to write again. I felt that the Party did not trust me, so I was dissatisfied with the party. After the rebellion, I was assigned to work in the Ministry of Urban Construction. I was more dissatisfied with the Party, believing that the Ministry of Urban Development was a cooperative work, and I was probably assigned me here because of the cousin. \\nIn the publishing house, I'm looking at the leadership, they are a little bad for me, I hate it. I always feel that in the publishing house can not show my talents and think that leadership does not value me. On one occasion, Comrade Ho Wen said that my grandma had a heavy temper, and I could not think about it for a few days. I felt that leaders looked at me like this. I was not a future, and I wanted to work in sports in my heart. I fully exposed me in the 1957 New Year's Day diary that I was forced to participate in the revolution, which reads as follows:\\n'In this night, I always want to write something, sing something, I always feel like a tidal pentium in my heart at this time, I always feel like a full of cavity to call out. \\nIn 1957, another year has passed in my life, this year I am 25 years old, I can't say it is a child, I have embarked on the path of independent life, and only, really only this time, I appreciate the taste of life, what will be the life of people, at least I can be sure I talk about the path of my life: marriage, work, birth Children old way. I say that this is not a pessimistic tone, comrades are not, I will not sing such a tone, although if an ambitious person deeply understands that he will go a 'ordinary', completely unexpectedly 'unexpectedly' road, always with some sentimental meaning. But now I'm not like this at all, because it's my own choice to go. \\nAt present, in such times, as a person is complex enough, he should take into account more in order to survive, for his own nation, so that I can only take such a path. \\nHere it shows that I am guilty of working in the revolution, but the real purpose is how to climb up in the revolutionary work, high standing and good treatment. In real life, work and life do not build a heart with socialism. \\nThe main material basis that dominates my personal climb up thinking is the bourgeois position. My family is doing business in the city. When I went to secondary school, I lived in stores, touching businessmen, their way of life and thought and affection had a great influence on me, after going to the Ministry of Urban Construction, this way of life attracted me, I always thought about the bourgeois life, which led me to climb up. I always feel that my thoughts are contradictory. On the surface it seems to be for socialism, but in real life I can't get rid of the personal desires of the bourgeois. I always deceive myself and also deceive others in words and deeds. \\nIt is not accidental that I have fallen into a right-wing, because of individualistic thinking, personal interests are always unsatisfied, satisfied, but I can't satisfy that, therefore, I have a dissatisfaction with the party. Favorite to find the party's shortcomings. Last year I bought two books on the Bohung incident. The book said: Last year the US State Department released a fabricated reactionary report. After the publication of this report, there was a big wave of outrage among the communists in the United States. As long as Khrushchev said whether or not, the problem would be solved. However, Comrade Khrushchev did not reply, so I thought that the party's shortcomings in the middle must have been caught. I would love to see that during the whole wind, I saw this secret report at Peking University. I felt very novel, interested, and copied down, and came back to spread it. Here I am completely caught up in opposition reactionaries. \\nAnother reason is the failure to draw the line between the counter-revolution and the revolution. My father worked with reactionary warlords in the Republic of China 15 years ago. When I grew up, he talked about his reactionary history. He often boasted to us about his reactionary history, how he climbed up, and he often put the rich and powerful of our relatives on the list. So called us to learn. One of these relatives was Pang Shinian, president of Bank of China in the past, of the pseudo-Nanjing Bank of China. \\nIn 1951, when the town was counter-productive, the People's Government arrested my father and sentenced to two years of labor rehabilitation. He was arrested by my brother, and I was studying in secondary school and not yet joined the regiment, did not think at all to clear the reactionary influence my father had given me, and had some hatred towards his father because he felt violent against our brother and mother. Thinking that he was arrested, he was missing a grandfather of Hades in his home. It is not to draw a line with him, not to stand in the position of the people to hate him. When I was studying in Shanghai, Peng shian Shinian was a capitalist in Shanghai. He was very warm to me. I was often criticized at university, but he was very good to me. I felt that if Peng shian Shinian wanted some power, I was on the line now. This clearly shows my reactionary climbing thinking, for personal name and good. Relying on reactionaries by no means, profit and profit. \\nIn addition, my family is also a landlord, although the field is not much, but exploitation is heavy, life is good, and my family is rich in the area of our hometown. I lived in the countryside when I was a kid (before I went to secondary school), and lived comfortably, and until now I was in the family life of the feudal exploitative class. To socialist society, for the present life, it is always unfit, feel that life is boring now, is 'hard to say it is a life of heaven', which is the obvious exposure of my anti-socialist emotions. \\nThese reasons have had to make me like the anti-socialist things of the opposition, the shortcomings and the dark side of the party, so all the reactionary consciousness of savings was vented in the whole wind and became one of the most fierce people in the opposition. When I started to criticize me, I couldn't accept the criticism of me and thought that the leaders could not tolerate even this. Later, with the help of comrades from the press, because the party and the leaders had repeatedly saved me, I found out that I had made mistakes and uncovered my dirty Outerwear, I think this campaign is saved me from the roots of bones, this time the party is really strict for me, otherwise I will also be blinded by my false image, will not propose my own ugly things, only strictly to me can really help me, warmth is not able to solve the problem, I feel that the party and comrades are strict on me, I have never received such strict help, this time I am from thought, work, life to life I should be classified as an enemy if it does not change the view of the whole depravity, not a certain aspect of the shortcomings. This time the party saved me, I am grateful to the party. If I still have a bit of conscience, I should hand over all my problems and figure it out. I am going to go through socialism, and in the future I will take up lessons in politics, and I need to get down to earth as a laborer. Customs clearance is easy verbally, actual action is not so easy. To pass through customs, we need to transform my bourgeois individualistic thinking in actual work, and diligently reclaim honest work. I want to try to pass through customs, change my bourgeois position and change the bourgeois lifestyle. I hope that the party and comrades test me. \\nIn the debate, many issues were fundamental changes to me, especially the issue of party leadership. In the past there was a period in the past, I was passionate about the party with a small bourgeoisie fanatic and emotional. Of course, it was very unfirm. After accepting the idea of the bourgeois, it was very likely to be reactionary, and there were many speeches, especially new, The contrast of the old society makes me feel great in every aspect of the work of the party Right, it makes me feel that people of conscience are willing to take the path of socialism. Only the Communist Party can lead the socialist road. Ge Peqi Zhang Bojun cannot lead. As long as ideological recognition of the Communist Party leadership and accept the Party's leadership, although it is politically weak, it will not make big mistakes. Recently, I looked at the '30 years of the Communist Party of China' and found that the CPC is indeed a congenital worries, I I feel that only the Communist Party can save China's lives, such as 25,000 miles long march of the Communist Party during the War of Resistance against Japan, climbing snow mountains, crossing the grass north to resist Japan, but the KMT does not resist. After the victory against Japan, the Kuomintang triumphs, and after the victory against Japan, the Kuomintang triumphs. As long as the head is firm in the Party's leadership, just look at the facts, You can know the need for the leadership of the party. \\nOn the issue of democratic freedom, from the actual situation, when I was reading elementary school, I lived in a classmate's family. There was a man who pulled a yellow van in the vicinity. At a time, a rich man took his car and stole his purse, hard said that the driver stole it, the coachman did not take it. He bribed the police with money, arrested the coachman, and then the coachman was arrested. It was dead. Now think about that in the past, as long as there was money, an acquitted person could be put to jail. Not long ago, I read a novel 'A Long Day in a Short Life', saying that a poor man was sentenced to jail, he wanted to commit suicide with his knife, unsuccessful and saved. He said, 'I want me to die, I want me to die, and you want me to live, how can I like the capitalist system? From here, it is clear from the many statements made at the meeting that society has democracy and freedom for the vast majority of its people. \\nOn the issue of cadre allocation, I used to think that unified distribution was not good. The report of Engineer Lin Zuodan said: 'There is freedom to find a job in the United States, and there is freedom to be dismissed'. I did not think of this before. What I want is the freedom of bourgeois. \\nElection question: I have not raised right-wing remarks in this regard. I think the current election is not unfree. When the Kuomintang, one of the most wanted robbers from Hunan was elected to the National Congress. How can such a person represent the interests of the people? Now that our elections are truly democratic, and if elected directly, we do not know who is good or bad, and only after full consultation can the most suitable person be selected. \\nNow I have a new understanding of the idea of 'people of bad class origin are not valued'. My brother and I were born to the same parent, and now he joined the party. From this ordinary example, it can be seen that class and family origin do not completely affect one person. \\nOn the issue of congenital worries, Comrade Peng shian Baoxian's speech was very comprehensive. One of them made me solve the problem most. He said: The root cause of the generation of privileged classes is the private ownership of the means of production. Now the means of production are not private ownership. How can the privileged class be created? He also gave a number of concrete examples such as ratings, welfare grants, and so forth that I completely rejected my right-wing rhetoric, which I confessed to losing. \\nFinally, I would like to talk about Shen Cuo, the right-wing activist, who took a bath last week in the bathhouse. Shen said to me: 'Your body is still very solid, in the future is good for re-education through labor. I am very willing to re-education through labor, but it is not good and too thin.' I said, 'I'm not talking to you about this now.' I think Shen Cheng's recalcitrant attitude is wrong. Just like Director Ding said, intellectuals must at least stick to the truth. Only honest accounts, admit mistakes are the only way out. Shen Chong also asked me, 'Have you been rectified in the past?' I said, 'No.' He said: 'I didn't, but I'm now moving from political issues to historical issues, and someone went to my house to investigate.' He also wanted to gather the right-wing elements together, recalcitrant in the end. Not long ago, Shen Chong also had to talk to the right, Chen Yizhang, the recalcitrant attitude of Shen Chu cannot but make people alerted. As a right-wing man willing to repent, I stand before everyone to admit my mistakes. I am willing to completely clear my soul. The dirty things in the depths, good labor, re-life, as for practical action, comrades can see my future performance.

Here is a vicious 'allegory', which insinuously insults the party, attacks activists who insist on the correct position in the sweeping movement, while painting and defending the rampant attacks of the right. \\nOne day, a wild boar and some bunny looking for food came to the sea, along the other side of the sea with beautiful fruits and fresh grass (rejoicing for this hungry animal is understandable), they often don't feel happy, but soon unhappy, how to cross the sea? Fortunately there is a small boat, although not repair, but still barely available, so we grab the boat. Boat to the midway, suddenly sprinkled some wind and rain, the boat a bit leaning to the right, the bunnies carefully stand in the right place, adjust the hull balance, but the boar exhale to the bunny exhaled, 'stupid! You won't love the boat at all, look at me.' Said to the left boat ride along, with the pressure of its obese body, the boat turned over. Of course, pigs and bunnies also fell into the sea. \\n× × ×\\nOn a hill with flowers, there is a bunch of animals, bunnies, squirrels, bears, wild boars, goats. They chose orangutans for their own heads. Orangutans think about a lot of ways for everyone to live well. Teach everyone in the mountains to plant fruit trees, planted a variety of flowers and grass, so that the day is good day by day. They feel happy and happy like living in heaven. Whenever flowers bloom, the trees hang big and red fruits, the little ones respect the orangutans so much that they feel that they can't live. \\nOne day the orangutan's foot grows sores, a hole appears, although the body of the orangutan is healthy, but it always causes discomfort. When squirrels, lambs, rabbits, they know that their family is sick, they all come to ask hot. \\n'This sores don't look at it long (in), feet, if not healed, will make your entire leg maimed,' said the goat anxious. \\n'Be careful not to let it crumble, otherwise it will be difficult.' The rabbit said to drive away the flies flying from time to time with small hands. Gradually all the little ones are coming, some say what medicine is good, some say well, should pay attention to what, this disease will not turn over. Everyone, you speak my word, just like caring for your own disease. \\nAt that time, the boar swings into, it took everyone a glance, and then went to the orangutan, it pulled its mouth into the ear of the orangutan, one hand climbed its shoulders, one hand covering his mouth; first laughed-'Hey! You don't listen to them, it's a bit of blind words.' It took the smiley face to everyone, and continued to say, 'I don't agree with you, it's all a fallacy. I found it sores on foot long ago, although now bigger than then, I never die! It's not a sore, it's a special device for air...'\\n'You...' Those little ones are staring at the wild boar. The boar is like a strong sun shoots his eyes and slowly lowered his head. \\nFriend! Isn't there something like this in our lives? Their own leadership is flawed, and proponents pinch their nose as merit, who always think 'left' is better than the right, and that the 'left' leaning opportunities is always much more glorious than the mistakes of right-wing opportunities. Because 'left' pour does not hurt (lose), position. And right, this is a matter of position, and if I want to say that I made a mistake, it is also a 'firm stand' error. \\nFriend! Isn't there something like this in our lives? I want to quickly declare a sentence, this is individual, for the shortcomings of the leader, he pinched his nose is also said to be an advantage, these people have buried a sentence rather 'left' not right. It will not be wrong to give the leaders a few more words, that is, it is wrong, but my position is 'firm', which is called 'loyalty', 'maintaining leadership authority' and 'good motivation' is always more glorious than you say leadership has shortcomings, because this is a position issue!

The home of the 'health expert' is not hygienic. As soon as you enter the door, it smells a smell. With our footsteps, a few chickens were flowing out in the house. \\nThis miserable right-wing element is no longer as stride as much as a month ago, much less as the arrogance of holding a large sputum to the East China Military and Political Commission. \\n'Today the newspaper, look, look, read, look a little bit.' On the one hand, one hurry upstairs, took a point to the News Daily, very embarrassed, 'To be honest, if you want to report, I have to think about it.' Why 'consider' it! See thieves are always disheartened. \\nIn the conversation, he struggled to exonerate his relationship with other right-wing groups. However, the sedation of the surface, can not hide the inner restlessness. He picked up and laid down the newspaper, and took it down: 'In terms of my relationship with Wang Zao, he has been less revolutionary in politics since the Seven Gentlemen incident. He differs politically from me.' We hold the laugh and listen to him blowing the ceiling. \\nIn fact, when Wang Zao was not very revolutionary, how should Peng Wen taste the revolution? As for today, they are completely 'co-minded' politically, that is, to pull China to the 'road' of capitalism. \\n'Lu Yi denounced that after the anti-right struggle, you also proposed three countermeasures to resist representations: one does not speak, second, talk about some, and the third is a big debate?' \\nThis makes him mess with his eyebrows: 'I am really confused... Of course, I can't say Lu Yi rumors, but I can't remember it. It may have been told to him, it may have spoken to others, or elsewhere; it may have not been said'. \\n'So, is Lu Yi exposing your problem, is it a fact?' \\nHe smiled and said, 'There are some facts.' But 'others', he can't say anything.-\\n【Attachment 2】Reporter Huang Ping/Ko Zefu et al: 'Abstract of reactionary remarks by right-wing man Peng wenying' (News Daily)\\n'There are more officials and bureaucracy in a socialist society. How to stop bureaucracy? Only democracy!' \\n'Today there is a 'wall' and 'trench' in party group relations. One of the reasons is that there are situations in cadres policy with non-learning, small material use, small material use (this is quite a lot in the party), there are no rights to work, there is no right, there are no virtues and talents, and so on, resulting in many unreasonable phenomena. Losses and masses discontent have affected party relations. The principle to resolve this contradiction is: meritocracy, exploitation and competence. Sage in office (political leadership), can work (business leadership), Sage should pay attention to strengthening business, can pay attention to strengthening politics, in order to achieve both merit and talent.' \\n'Since liberation, our news campaign has been a huge success, but there are also biases and shortcomings... the one-sided nature of the news coverage. There is a lot of news in the newspapers that are one-sided, and the Annunciation is not worried, good or bad. Now full of paper disadvantages, performance running light, gone. Now everyone has been 'paradox world'. Some days ago it was 'Pacific World'. \\n'One of the reasons for Stalin's mistakes is that the newspapers have not revealed mistakes for a long time. Newspapers should dare to expose mistakes, do not report good news, and not just fight flies mosquitoes.' \\n'Learning the Soviet Union is not necessarily good, learning America is not necessarily bad.' \\n'Our country's reward for inventions and rationalization proposals is nothing more than towels, teacups, sweatshirts, awards.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached 3] Peng wenying: Report to the NLD Municipal Committee and the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party Committee (1958.7.15)\\nI am very willing to report my life, study, work to my leadership. However, it was not clear how such a report should be written and would be instructed. \\nNow, over the last month, some of my main reports are as follows:\\nI am not currently assigned to my work and what meetings to attend. Looks like I'm very idle. But actually my life and how many years have not been idle, only a few more things added than before. \\nFirst of all, since my loved one died last year, I couldn't ignore a lot of things at home, such as the education management of children, taking them to see a doctor, and many things I needed to do at home. Since my source of life was cut off in May, I quit the former maid for austerity, and I did everything at home. But my mother-in-law is old and the children go to school again, and my part is quite a few. Every morning I went to the food field to buy food, pack my room, wash my clothes, sometimes cook rice, drag the floor, pour vegetables in the garden. These labor, I do not care. \\nCurrent affairs learning, including policy learning, is spending a lot of time every day (on average 2-3 hours). I have subscribed to the People's Daily and the Liberation Daily. I almost finished reading. In addition, go to the entrance of the post office or Fuxing Park to look at newspapers such as Wen Wei Po, the News Daily, the Xinmin Evening News and other newspapers. For a year I was 'isolated', I heard directly and had contact with the world, and Robinson was not much better on the island. But through the newspapers, I can still know the progress of the country, the inventions of workers, the lives of tens of thousands of farmers, and the triumph of the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa. This is where Robinson does not compare to me again. In reading the newspaper, not only relieved a person's idle suffering, but also raised countless questions, and gave me something that I should be overwhelmed. Many of them I cut off, many are going to study further, and many to further sort out my opinions. \\nI originally ordered about 30 kinds of Chinese and foreign magazines, this year I won't let me book, currently only Chinese science, current affairs and theory magazines. These I also often look at, and feel a lot of interest. \\nI almost went to see some of the recent exhibitions, and went many times and looked quite carefully. There were 6 or 7 times in foreign language book exhibition, heavy industry exhibition, commercial exhibition, vegetable exhibition, building exhibition, watch exhibition, more than 10 times. I think anyone who cares a little about the construction of the country and the improvement of people's lives can not but feel great attraction for these new advances in recent times. I've got a lot of inspiration at these fairs, from what I've thought about in the past, improved and some inspired me new ideas. \\nIn various fairs, I gave them comments (not less than dozens of times), wherever I saw improvements. Some of the facilitators expressed their favour at that time and would like to study further. For example:\\n(1), Call from around Shanghai to Beijing, first call Shanghai, and then transfer from Shanghai to Beijing. I suggest that Shanghai simply connect the line and hit Beijing directly from all over, so that you can save many formalities and time and materials, I think it will work. \\n(2), Some vehicles of the Municipal Works Agency, I recommend reducing the metal portion, replacing it with wood to save metal while reducing weight. The worker who invented the car was quite sure. \\n(3), A wrench with a 6-angle screw is smart, but each can only play one number. I told the invention worker to improve the head, and he was happy to play any number of hex screws. \\n(4), a handicrafts company created by the sawwood board machine, I propose to improve the position of the saw, you can change the two processes into one. \\n(5), At the Vegetable Fair, I gave them some new experiences of pork breeding at the Jiangxi Advanced Agriculture and Forestry School (I am the principal), to comrades of Liming. I gave them a pack of seeds that were not available in Shanghai. \\n(6), I wrote 4 pages of written comments at the Foreign Language Book Fair. \\nThere are, however, a few examples, and some issues need to be further considered. \\nI am now looking at improving the parts of the bike so that it can increase speed and turn it into a power engine to apply to various jobs in the countryside. I think that if it can be done, it will have a great effect on reducing labor, improving work efficiency and saving. Many of the good news letters at the construction industry exhibition have eliminated the painful phenomenon of 'shoulders and shoulders'. 'I can live for a few more years later,' said one worker. I think: there is no more meaningful thing in the world than that, so it's worth using the brains. \\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached 4】Peng Zhiyi: 'The Last Five Years of Papa Peng wenying' (June 2004)\\nIn the early summer of 1957, I was a first-year student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel. After class, playing basketball, swimming, running, outing, watching movies... my life is both full and happy. It is not very concerned about what is happening around the side that will affect the destiny of families and the country: the anti-right struggle that starts with helping the party rectify and then turn to. Until late June, Shanghai's Liberation Daily published an article by my dad 'Peng Wen should have serious anti-party words and deeds, and members of the NLD's Shanghai Municipal Committee Committee organs revealed', and was reprinted by the People's Daily. I was very shocked when I saw it, but instead thought that my father had been revolutionary throughout his life, opposed the KMT reactionaries, had always supported the Communist Party, and it was impossible to oppose anti-socialism. Even if some shortcomings were wrong, as long as they were treated correctly, accept criticism, correct mistakes. I never imagined that the criticism of my father was escalating as the anti-right struggle intensified. He was described as the backbone right-wing of the 'Zhangluo Alliance' in Shanghai. Since then, I became a child of the Great Right from a proud revolutionary descendant. In just five years, my family died three people (mom, brother, dad), and suffered a huge change in the death of the family. \\nDue to the anti-right relationship, the school announced that it would not take summer holidays. On July 19, Shanghai's Liberation Daily published Zhang Chunqiao's article 'Questioning Peng wenying'. This article criminalizes my father 'sin' according to the 'presumption of guilt' (after finding evidence). On the same day, I received an emergency call from my home in Shanghai, with only four letters 'dead, fast return', really blue bolt! When I and my sister Yannie, who studied in the Department of Architecture at Tsinghua University, quickly rushed back to Shanghai on the 21st by train, I couldn't catch up with my dear mother-she had a mortuary and a coffin was nailed to her beloved mother because of the hot weather. Only one cry from Grandma and four younger siblings were heard. In the day of death, the father could not be seen. Originally, he went to NLD organs every day for critical struggles. On July 19, when mom saw the newspaper, saw Zhang Chunqiao's article, could not withstand the pressure of increasing criticism of his father, blood pressure increased, heart disease recurrence, hanging in the emergency room of the sixth hospital, how much hope to see her husband side when he died. At that time, Dad was also being criticized in the Cultural Square and was not allowed to receive emergency calls, let alone leave. The 44-year-old mother did not expect to see the last side of Dad, died in the sadness of 'Wenying' and 'Wenying'! There are only grandmothers in their 60s and a 15-year-old brother, 12, 10, and eight years old. After 20 years, Zhang Chunqiao, an ambition conspirator with eyes, evil and evil reports, did bad things. After more than 20 years, he died in the sabotage of hundreds of millions of people, and was forever crucified on the stigma of history. \\nRecall that a year ago, in the summer of 1956, I was admitted to the Beijing Iron and Steel Institute, and my mom and dad were very happy. Mom took out the bank passbook and asked me to withdraw money on her behalf. After that, my dad accompanied me to buy a cold coat, scarf and hat, and my mother accompanied me to buy new watches, suitcases and daily necessities. In the evening, Dad summoned the whole family to sit together for a 'tea party'. Sweets, snacks, fruits are on the table-this is my traditional way of educating children. Dad told us about national events, the ideals and future of young people. Talking about his 13 years old, taking Tsinghua, carrying a backpack, holding an umbrella, and Wang Zaibo, two years older than him, went out of Anfu hill village to attend school in Beijing, how he studied hard in the United States, after his return to home until liberation, and engaged in anti-Jiang patriotic democratic movement... Encourage me to learn well, new China is under construction, there is a lot of promise in the future, no amount of future... Repeated caution, North cold, to wear more clothes, pay attention to nutrition, eat well, pay attention to personal hygiene, often write letters to the home, and so on. I kept nodding, but the little sisters have heard impatient, rushing candy to the mouth stuffed, and from time to time to time in front of my mother and dad, suing each other. Nowadays, remembering the joy of the time, is gone, very sad, tears. \\nDuring the rest of the summer vacation, my sister and I wanted to figure out what's wrong with Dad. We visited the NLD Municipal Committee and Municipal Committee United Front Department to hear the views of the leaders and attended meetings that criticize the father. The leaders in question want us to clear the boundaries, stand in the positions of the Party and the people, and help dad to raise awareness and upkeep his attitude in order to 'bow down to confess guilt.' We also had a few long conversations with Dad. Dad was at the pain of his wife, and was woven with a lot of charges, really called the Black Cloud Press City, the mood was very depressed and painful. But he was open to us: 'Since the time of five siege, I started to support the Chinese Communist Party and have not done a single anti-party thing for decades. Instead, I always do things for the party for the people.' 'During the Jiangxi resistance war, the Kuomintang wants to kill the Communist Party, I oppose. At one meeting, KMT reactionary officers threatened to pull shots and were in danger. Later, Prime Minister Ji'an Zhou also came to see me. So I don't think I have an anti-party.' After decades of revolutionary life, all in order to add bricks to socialism. Now it is once said to be a person who dig up the socialist wall, an anti-socialist man, and an anti-socialist man. How can he accept it? The more I hear, the more I think he's right. However, at that time, the overwhelming critical articles all sang a tone with Zhang Chunqiao, saying that Peng Wen should be a right-wing member of the anti-party anti-socialist opposition. It is not permissible for you to discern, nor can you think. My sister and I, at the age of 18, were only able to say goodbye to the extremely isolated dads and brothers back to school with many doubts and confusion. While I am in Beijing, I miss my dad and family at times. I try to come home to visit them when I have winter and summer holidays. \\nThe Municipal Committee of the Shanghai NLD and the Municipal People's Congress have held dozens of meetings and conferences for Dad to criticize, help and educate him. Because he is unequivocal, unambiguous, insists on what he thinks is correct, refuses to put false words on his head against his heart, does not write a review book, only write facts and opinions, and refuses to 'bow down to confess guilt.' On August 31, 1957, at the Second Second Congress of Shanghai, Dad said: 'There can be three kinds of people in a society. The first kind of person is not satisfied with this society this country. Such people see only shortcomings and do not see grades. The second kind of person is very satisfied with this society, this country is willing to embrace it and defend it. Such people saw achievements but ignored the shortcomings, or had not yet taken a way to eliminate them. The third kind of people is to love this country, see its achievements, but also see the shortcomings and problems that still exist. In order to make this society a country more satisfying, more consolidated, moving forward, and people living more prosperous and happier, he is not satisfied with the status quo, he is thinking of the future, and there are shortcomings next to his reluctance to achieve. He does not only pay attention to the shortcomings, but more day to night, to take a way to improve his work and eliminate the shortcomings. A history of human progress is created by this kind of person...' Dad self-proclaimed himself as a 'third person.' This is not a review by right-wing elements, but a 'manifesto' of a patriotic intellectuals, party friends. In the atmosphere of the far left route at that time, he was 'shelled' by participants, whose 'recalcitrant' greatly angered the authorities, and his 'right-wing crimes' and recalcitrant attitude were on the front page of the newspaper. According to incomplete statistics, during the anti-right struggle in 1957, more than 60 thematic articles and reports from various newspapers across the country criticized Peng wenying, 16 of which were published on the front page. It is not hard to see the fierce of the siege of fire! He and his family paid a painful price for that. \\nIn 1958, Dad was officially (by writing), wearing a right-wing hat. He was subjected to the most severe punishment: the removal of all positions within and outside the Union, to stay in the League, sever all sources of life, and supervise labor. Since then, family life has become increasingly difficult. The garden house at 55 Nanchang Road, rent of more than 80 yuan per month, cannot be delivered. After being ordered to pay over 2,000 yuan of rent, the whole family was forced to squeeze into a 15-square-meter bucket room in Taicang Fang, South Chongqing Road. The back of the house is a 6 square meters small bathroom, brother can only sleep in the bathroom, and dad can only sleep in a nearby friend's house. During the holidays, my sister and my sister can only sleep on the ground. \\nMoms die prematurely, dads are often called for criticism or work in the countryside, and their younger siblings do not receive the care they deserve, and they are discriminated against and stigmatized in schools. They are difficult to adapt to changes in the environment, they do not understand their dad, and therefore resentment, their character is distorted to varying degrees, often noisy at home and life is very precarious. Thirteen and four years old during the flower season was forced to barely head home. Dad was very distressed for this, but he had no means to do it. \\nAt that time, cadres from the NLD and the United Front Front Ministry often came to the door to 'discourage After finding the above situation, a United Front War cadre said: As long as you write dozens of words to check, recognize a mistake, you will solve any problems. He also came to exhorted him after he took his hat. Two sister Vivian had kneeling in front of his father, begging him 'for the sake of children, in order to be able to live, you admit it.' But on a matter of principle, Dad's inner faith is very strong. He insisted: 'I am your friend, you treat me as an enemy, I am not anti-socialist, I am not wrong!' He said to Wang Bobo, 'Being human beings should be consistent inside and outside, with one heart.' 'The economy and the family are becoming increasingly difficult, especially for children, who are pessimistic about the future of the family and cannot be disciplined. But political issues should not be treated at the expense of personal gain, which are two completely different issues.' He will not spit a word and write a word against his heart. Others can pour dirty water on him, he always maintain his dignity, have the opportunity to clarify his consistent position and views, and Nuneath defends himself. Therefore, he was crowned with the so-called 'stubborn' right-wing, the man who 'went to God with a granite head'. Around 1960, many people who reviewed the clearance had taken the right hats and were arranged. My dad was not removed until April 1978, when the CPC Central Committee sent an abstraction of all right-wing hats. But at that time, he died for 16 years. \\nComrade Wu Nan of the Shanghai NLD Municipal Committee was in charge of contacting my father because he often came to our house and talked to his father and our children. He cared about his thoughts about his life, and through his contacts, helped us solve some problems. He also visited my house after his death. The NLD municipal committee also gave me a living allowance of $25 a month to three sisters who were still in school, until the start of the Cultural Revolution in 1966. My family and I would like to thank Comrade Wu Nan and the NLD organization for their constant interest in dad and our children. I was introduced by him and Comrade Lu to join the NLD organization in 1987, and I became a very talkable 'forbidden affair'. Due to the interest of the NLD organization and the trust of my comrades, I served as the chairman of the committee of the Shanghai Electric Corporation of NLD. In October 1997, I was elected as a member representative to Beijing honorably attended the 8th National Congress of the NLD. I will inherit the glorious revolutionary tradition of my fathers and contribute to my country and people. \\nIn the fall of 1960, my sister Yannie is about to graduate from Tsinghua University. Dad was pleased to write an inscription for her:\\nUnderstand the truth of the world,\\nMake yourself progress every day,\\nReach the best situation,\\nFor Motherland and Humanity\\nContinuously make useful contributions. Father 1960.9.12\\nThis is the last message from our dad to our children. My sister responded to the party's call. After graduating from Tsinghua University, I volunteered to work in the hardest northwest of the motherland, assigned to the remote Ningxia Yinchuan Design Institute. \\nWhile studying in the United States, Dad liked to brainstorm and think about some technological inventions, such as air trains, aerial cars, improved clothing and so on. Before and after liberation, he has made many reasonable proposals in different ways on various occasions. Such as: promote eating more coarse grains, brown rice, for health; promote the use of meal meal or use chopsticks to prevent infectious diseases; recommended to open parks and green venues, cancel park fees; strengthen urban excreta management, abolish the use of wooden toilets; promote fertility control, control population growth too fast...\\nIn 1956, when he traveled to Beijing, vice-premier Chen Yi invited him to eat. He mentioned that he wanted to design a two-sided pants that could extend the service life, save money and save cloth. Mr. Chen said happily after hearing: you invented it, I came to sign... At that time, Dad was in adversity, but he was still at home constantly engaged in technological invention, drawing design drawings, such as 'hook and brick', 'train boat', 'insulated lunch box' and so on. He went to visit various fairs and went around to make proposals for rationalization. In the second half of 1958, many municipal 'right-wing elements' in Shanghai were concentrated in the suburbs of Zhuanqiao, and he was also instructed to participate. But he stated: 'If it is compulsory labor, I am happy to participate.' That means that I went back to the country not as a right-wing member to reform labor. In the countryside, he also put forward a lot of opinions on agricultural production and improvement of agricultural tools. \\nIn July 1958, he wrote to Premier Zhou and Deputy Prime Minister Chen, applying for 'personally volunteering to travel to the Middle East or North Africa to participate in any job suitable for me in the fight against imperialism... I am familiar with English and have learned French German, without problems...' for the people's heart. He naively believes that politics cannot play a role, but can also use scientific and technological inventions or other means to serve the motherland and serve the people. But in the era when the class struggles overwhelmingly, wearing a 'right' hat on his head was destined to hit walls everywhere, without any door to the country. \\nIn 1961, I graduated from Beijing Iron and Steel Institute. I volunteered to return to Shanghai to work, because I need to take care of my father and younger sister. The school met my requirements and I returned to them. I came back and let the diligent dad get some comfort. At least there can be a helper for anything at home. Brothers and sisters are happy too, they love me, and we still have deep feelings. \\nIn 1959, his brother Zhiping graduated from Xiangming High School with excellent academic grades. Because of his father's right-wing problems, he was unable to go to college, and resided in a bucket room, unable to endure the great changes in the family and gradually suffered from depression. A year later, he was admitted to Shanghai Songjiang Normal College. After the school was spelled into Shanghai Normal College, he entered the Chinese language professional. In March 1961, he had privately taken sleeping pills, broken glass and other attempts to do his own. Fortunately, he found it early, promptly sent to Guangci Hospital for rescue before getting rid of the risk. Since then, he became more serious and became schizophrenia. On December 20 of that year, he took a lot of sleeping pills in the student dormitory of Shanghai Teachers College and was not awake. When my father and I came to the news, he was called upon to no longer wake up. Dad holds a 19-year-old brother howling and crying, his heart is dripping blood! \\n'Life should be happy, noble and promising, and the future is probably bright,' his brother wrote in the 'Letter' on the 19th. My life is painful and humble. My future, like the present, is dark, and I'm forced to think of the end... the extreme pain of personal suffering is difficult to tell... the burden of the family is unimaginable... the idea that circled in my head all day long... a strong belief in the slim death...'\\nDad wrote in the back of his brother's portrayal photo:\\nA genius literary, a dead flower, a victim of the fight against the right. \\nHe personally made a wooden card for his brother, written in English in the middle of the card:\\n'Fight for democratic, free and equal national education! \\nContinue ten thousand years! \\nCommemoration of my dearest son. Father 1962.1.20\\nThe death of his brother, for dad is another physical and mental impairment, grief, only for the day! \\nAt this point, my aunt (father's sister), Maynin wrote a letter accusing Dad of not admitting his mistakes and not solving his own problems well, thus endangering the family and children. Faced with the incomprehension and reproach of a loved one, Dad wrote a reply to Sister Mei Nien, patiently explaining to her: 'I don't think I don't want to go with the Communist Party as you misunderstood in your letter, or what anti-socialism. The goal I have struggled throughout my life, that is, like what the Communist Party wants to achieve, is how to build the country to become rich and strong, and how to make the people in general, especially poor workers and farmers, live better lives. For such a purpose, I have taken many risks against the KMT over the past few decades. Also for such a purpose, they will be willing to contribute their own strength under the leadership of the Communist Party and cannot have any other intention.' 'Declared to the right, has suffered endless stigma and misfortune against their families and even their relatives. But this is not what I could expect. Since it happened, I only had to solve it according to the most correct approach. For more than 3 years I have not done very well for a variety of reasons, it is wrong, but my overall direction, I think it is good. Describe good intentions as malice, describe good things as bad things, to speak of helping the party and the government as opposition, portraying a friend as an enemy, and doing so is not possible and should not... and finally always come to figure out what is clear. Such representations are essential to the party, to the people, to themselves, to the underground parents and all the people concerned. I always have to be a person, worthy of these people...' These are dad's heartfelt words, forever. \\nAt this time, it was a difficult period of three years. Dad did not count on personal humiliation and family subsistence, considering that the people all over the country were starving at that time. He refused to be a private teacher, interpreter and other livelihoods, eating pedagra, leipi, and enduring pain (puffiness due to malnutrition), and wrote the proposal 'to develop agricultural production all day and night' and sent a letter of opinion to Chairman Mao Zhou. Within the end of the anti-right struggle, remove all right-wing hats. 'Unite, build socialism'. In the summer of 1962, Dame Chi Kang received Shanghai First Medical College with honors, which gave Dad a great spiritual comfort. \\nSince then, dad's body is getting worse and heart disease is getting worse. In early November, his father was in serious condition. Wang Zaoshibo came to the news. Together with me, he called an ambulance to send his father to Guangci Hospital for emergency care, and was admitted to hospital with the help of Professor Zhang Ximing, former vice president of Guangci Hospital, who was also the right. In order to take care of the sick dad, I asked the unit for a holiday night to accompany the father's bed. Sisters also often come to visit their dads after school. Sister Yan Ni later took leave from Ningxia Yinchuan back to Shanghai to visit his father. Dad's friends such as Wang Zaoshi, Liu Haisu and Shaijoe couple visited him several times. The leadership of the NLD Municipal Committee and the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party Committee of the Communist Party of China also sent a visit, instructing him to rest assured of medical treatment and said that the medical costs of hospitalization would be resolved by These have given the poor dad a lot of comfort. Sun Dayubo had just been out of jail, personally burned a tea pot chestnut roast chicken sent for him. At the time this was really a delicious meal, and Dad was able to eat. I once went to Huaihai Road Laosong Sheng to give him a bowl of 'home-made tofu', and he also enjoyed eating. At the time of his illness, he proposed to eat milk. Fortunately, Harbin food factory on Huaihai Road sold every morning. We went to line up to buy it for him, but also met his little requirements. \\nDad spent more than 40 days in the hospital. The initial condition is critical, after rescuing has eased. In his condition, he asked my sister and me to thank the leaders, relatives and friends who care and come to visit him, and said they must take time to make clear their problems to the organization. He asked our children to trust and rely on organizations, to do their job and to be a person who is useful to the nation for the people. Because Dad has long been subjected to great political and economic pressure, the disease has been stumbling, this time the condition is ferocious, later turned to pericarditis, sepsis, even after hospital rescue, finally unable to go back to heaven. \\nOn the 15th of 1962, with the westernwestern wind whistling in the winter, Dad left the world he loved, and went to heaven to reunite with his mother and brother, aged 58. \\nAfter dad's death, Mrs. Liu Haisu and Wang Zaoshibo were keen to help us prepare the aftermath and drew up a list of persons who were ready to invite to attend the memorial service. Later because Dad was a great right, and refused to bow to confess guilt, held a memorial service, worried about bad impact, so through Wang Bo to dissuade. At the end of the memorial service, Wang Bobo led our five children and several relatives to bid farewell to the remains of our father at the IWC funeral home. Sun Dayubo quietly came to the funeral home early in the morning to bid farewell to his old Tsinghua classmate, old comrades of the NLD, leaving us an envelope after crying, containing 20 yuan. Sun Bobo was criticized for this matter. Until 18 years later, I and I went to visit him and thanked him, saying, 'I and Peng Wen should be a teenager student in Tsinghua, who was revolutionized and opposed to the Kuomintang. He was very good for the democratic revolution. Taking my relationship with him, send $20 too little, should send him 200 yuan, unfortunately, I don't have money. I'm not wrong, want me to write check I don't write!' \\nMom graduated from Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts in the 1930s, when Liu Haisu was the principal. Liu also became a right-wing element in the fight against the right. He was in the same group with his father, because the two houses were similar and often had contacts. My sister Chi Kang and Liu Jia-little daughter had learned painting from Mrs. Haisu Shaijo. Liu very much admired Dad's people, sympathized with his father's political thought and cared about in life. My sister and I went to visit Dad after his death. He has said to us many times, 'Your father has the bone, the spirit, and it's amazing.' I am sorry for the premature death of our mother, brother and dad. \\nIn his life, Dad is practicing the patriotic ideals he put forward in the article when studying in Tsinghua: 'Salvation of the nation is the imperative of China today, and the inescapable responsibility of all Tsinghua.' 'My people are the advantages of the country, as the people expect, should be how to taste the bile salary, including hard work, adventure, all sorts of trouble, husband can then make chaos anyway, get rid of compatriots and fire.' Whenever the motherland is in distress, the Communist Party, the NLD organization is distressed, dad always comes forward, presiding justice and at the forefront of the struggle. He is upright and dares to stick to the truth. He has the courage to sacrifice himself and is helpful. 'I have been a democrat myself for so many years, and I have always thought that I should always be at the forefront of any movement, and at all times, I should be an activist (of course I didn't do it well). I try to be an activist in front of friends, students, young people, and often encourage them.' 'Over the years, I have maintained a 'good thinking, reckless' attitude, 'speak unspoken, endless', regardless of the ridicule and opposition of others (but sometimes this concern persists, causing me to express my views on many issues).' ... but he was shameless about some of the good things he had done, and never publicized (even when he had funded the week's prime minister to rescue the arrested Revolutionary comrades, he had been shot by a KMT reactionary officer at the meeting for his opposition to attacking the Soviet district. For this week, the prime minister went to Gian to express his gratitude and condolences to him He has never told our children), nor ask others to be thankful to him or Return. \\nDad wrote his own bright history with the practical actions of his life, and made serious efforts to carry out the duties of a patriotic intellectuals, leaders of democratic parties, people's deputies and members of the CPPCC. His life history is a testament to the fact that he is a faithful son of the motherland people, an outstanding member of the Chinese Democratic League, a sinceful friend of the Communist Party of China, and a good father who has made our children and descendants always proud and proud. \\nWith mom, brother and dad passed away in five years, our family is really 'dead', very tragic. We buried the ashes of our father and brother next to their mother's tomb in the 'Jiangxi Cemetery' in Xujiahui Xuchang Bridge (now near Guiping Road), in Xujiahui, where three of them meet in the Kingdom of Heaven. In 1966, the Cultural Revolution began with a gun, the 'Jiangxi cemetery' was razed to the ground. Nor is peace for those who die. \\nFortunately, fortunately, Dad had left the world at the time of the Cultural Revolution, and had not been destroyed by the attack. And Sun Dayu and Wang Zao, the two Bober, were beaten by Red Guards in the Cultural Revolution, raided their homes, imprisoned and tortured. Sun Bobo, finally survived the devastation of the Cultural Revolution, and later was fortunate to continue his beloved work-translation and publication of Shakespeare's poems by Dafenhau in the UK. He died in 1997 and was 92 years old. And Wang Bobo, the 'seven gentlemen', was bitter. Although he was classified as a right-wing in 1957, because of his good 'review' and good performance, he was removed from the right-wing hat in 1960 and arranged his work. It also asked him to persuade my father to 'bow down to confess guilt.' He was arrested and imprisoned in November 1966 on charges of 'an active counter-revolutionary group'. One pass was more than four years without trial, and no family visits were allowed. In prison, he lost his name, only one number. He was hospitalized in 1971. He was sent to the hospital in 1971. He was sent to the West Day in August, and the next day after cremation was notified to his family to collect the ashes. The remains are said to be skinny, scaled, and their arms broken and miserable. His ashes had to leave the countryside under a pseudonym. His two sons and one daughter died during the Cultural Revolution. Together with the eldest daughter who died after the right in 1957, one of the four children was not left behind. 'Seven gentlemen', now only leave a bunch of ashes called by the name, so suffered, sad, pathetic, lamenable! Such people called 'Anfu Sanjie' Luolongji, Wang Zaoshi, and Peng wenying in 1957 all became right-wing elements, died in 1965, 1971, 1962. \\nIn 1957, the protection of 'anti-revolutionaries Timing' became a major 'crime' for his father. Tieming is a student at Tsinghua School of Dad. He studied in the United States and the United Kingdom, specializing in agronomy, biology, and received a PhD degree, is an upright patriotic intellectuals. In 1951, Tieming was arrested and sentenced for counter-revolutionary crime. In 1956, during his visit to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Dad asked for the early release of Tim Ming to allow him to contribute more to the country as a senior technician. In 1939, Tieming launched a donation of science and technology books in Britain to support the patriotic action of universities that China moved to Kunming as a result of the aggression of Japan and Kou. It was supported by British people from all walks of life and patriotic Chinese. In 1941, more than 30,000 copies of carefully selected standard reference books of various kinds of science and technology were shipped through Hong Kong To Kunming, it has played a huge role in improving the quality of teaching in the relocated university. Tieming was released in"},

In 1983, after his complaint, he was acquitted and completely rehabilitated by the Municipal High Court after a retrial. He retired as a university professor. In 1986, British Queen Elizabeth II held a reception during his visit to Shanghai. The British side named TieMing, an 81-year-old man who contributed to Sino-British friendship in World War II. After a laborious search, he became the only unofficial guest invited. I think Dad will be happy for Timingberg in the spirit of heaven. In 2001, Tiemingbo died, after a troubled elderly life of 96 years old, spent a happy old age under the care of his daughter Tieyi family. \\nDad died prematurely, but in the Cultural Revolution, our children still suffered a little on his behalf. Our home, on the eve of liberation, was copied home by KMT agents, and took a large amount of belongings. In the Cultural Revolution, he was once again dubbed home. My sisters and I were criticized as 'bourgeoisists of the right' at the entrance. My loved one was an assistant at Shanghai Jiaotong University at that time, and was also criticized to supervise labor, and her first child was forced to abortion. Well, we were young at that time, and after the storm of the fight against the right, we all came over in the Cultural Revolution. \\nDad's teachings always inspire us, and we take pride in having such a party friend, ally and comrades. Our five children work and study all hard work. My sister Yannie is an expert in civil engineering; I was deputy chief engineer at Shanghai General Machinery Group Corporation; Dister Chi Kang settled in Canada, a professor and a famous immunologist at the University of Manitoba; two small sisters Wei Wei and Ling Ling, responded to the party's call to go up to the mountain and back to Shanghai, now from work Bit retired.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Appendix II】Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (Communist Party of China): 'The Reactionary Words and Deeds of the Rightists Pangwen Association\\nCV\\nThe Ponwen Society was born in July 1921. Hunan Xiangtan people. His father, Pang Quan, was one of the leaders of the labor union during the revolution and was killed by warlords in early 1922. After the death of Pang father, Pang lived with his mother in Shanghai anarchism base camp--Labor University, whose mother lived with an anarchist Yuan Shaoxian in 1928. Pang returned to Hunan separated from his mother. His father had a deep affair with Xiao Tongzi and Wang Guanghui, and so on. After his father died, the labor union was dissolved. Xiao and others betrayed the revolution and invested in the KMT. \\nSince 1930, Xiao (head of the Central News Agency and the KMT Central Committee), has 'helped' and 'cultivate' the Ponwen Association. Xiao applied for a pension from the Kuomintang, $400 per year, from 1930 to 1943, received the 'restoration of land rent' by the Pang family, and by the time of liberation had collected 80 tons of land rent (after the Pangjia division, Pang was classified as a small land lease during land reform, his uncle was the landowner). After 1935, the cost of Pang is Xiao, Wang supply. \\nBefore liberation, as a result of Xiao's 'cultivation', Pang had entered the pseudo-central news three times. He wrote reactionary articles, slandered the Zosan incident and the university movement, and fabricated the 'Reference Message' (sent to KMT ministers, pseudo-CPC Standing Committee and other senior officials), compiled the 'Special Reference' in the Reference Message (Write a total of 4 points, one to Chiang Kai-shek, one to the KMT Central Propaganda Department, one send Xiao Tongzi, president of the Central News Agency, sent to Chen Bosheng, editor-in-chief of the Central News Agency), compiled the annual book of the KMT's propaganda department system and work, edited internal documents and edits newsletter. Attended the plenary meeting of the KMT Central Committee. Central News Agency informed Pang to open 'outstanding party members' to attend a meeting (Pang himself said it was not a KMT member who had not gone). \\nAgainst the student movement, 'splashing cold water', 'mocking' or even blows to the democratic movement, running yellow posters, corruption of life, eating, drinking, buying and gambling. \\nIn early 1949, Pang and hidden his family of Shen Zonglin, deputy editorial director of the Central Committee (two months later escaped from Guangzhou). After liberation, Pang side with the strong genus as the signboard, carried out comrade Li Weihan everywhere and carried out a series of activities. Shouting for the landlord's uncle, and for Wang Guanghui (industrial transport traitor, senior official of the Kuomintang Ministry of Finance, and after liberation for the Hunan Provincial People's Government), to delete the autobiography. Using authority, collusion with private businesses in massive embezzlement. In April 1952, he was dismissed because of poor quality, unclear history, consistent embezzlement, bad circumstances. \\nIn September 1952, while working in the National Federation of Commerce and Industry, it organized small groups, spread many disparaging the party's discourse, cracking down on leaders, playing two ways, dissociating organizations and masses, and dissatisfied with the organization. \\nIn March 1956, Pang worked to the publishing house.] \\nFirst, the anti-socialist view of the anti-party (its reactionary remarks appear in the 'left face')\\n(i), Attacks on the leadership of the Communist Party, the Opposition\\nThe Communist Party is a sectarian\\nAsking how I think about the party in the end, it is really ironic on this issue, but it also has to be answered. Explained in two ways: I have no doubts about the nature and tasks of the party and the interpretation of the classic writings. In addition, did some comrades find material in my statement that my statement was incompatible with those provisions? Are there comrades looking to find out something? Find it! \\nThe Communist Party is a sectarian, a small circle, not associated with people's flesh and blood. The aim of the Communist Party movements was the whole person. \\nWhy do you look like this? On the one hand, their own positions are different; on the one hand, according to their own historical development path, seeing the KMT do it unconsciously, believing that the Communist Party is like the Kuomintang. \\nTo lead the 'sedan'\\nIn the group, I focused on my advice to the leaders, perhaps giving the impression that I was trying to drag my legs in the group and want to get down the car. I don't mean that. Publishers want to develop, the king will sit down in the car, let me go up not, others can't go up, good comrades do not have to worry about this. As a business of publishing house, as Comrade Wang Chi personally, I cannot get off the car. As for me, to work, I need to carry them down well. Of course, lift and walk will encounter: will not lift or sit, there will be problems. But this is another question. \\nSay that the party is 'once the right is in hand, it will do it.'\\nFrom the Party's point of view, it reflects the same situation as the newspaper said; the party is proud of merit, old intellectuals will most be proud. Such a touch will inevitably produce contradictions and pain. And when there is a contradiction, I will disobey you, and as soon as you are in your hand, you will do the order. Han Feizo's laws, techniques, and potential are the patrimony of the motherland, but it is not appropriate to use it to resolve internal conflicts among the people. What is surgery and potential? Is the authority of the party, the law is divided and isolated. In this way, it must be scary with the party. \\nUsing historical issues and so on to scary, in general, is the centralization of trialism. \\nAgainst the people's democratic dictator\\nThe problem is that the right are competing for leadership, and this would never be the case if the right-wing elements were not aggressive; it would be hard to go down without a negation, or a leap or mutation. Some cases have already revealed this problem (according to: Pomwen said July 10: seeing workers express their opinion, it is seen as a sign of mutation). \\nIf the right is really competing for leadership, a mutation is not necessary. A worker and farmer dictator! The Soviet Union has been doing this for 40 years, why can't it be! \\nA replica of Chuanping's 'party world' fallacy\\nThere is no 'one-size-fits-all' explanation in our statement to debate the issue of 'one thing'. The team leader of Nasha is not a party member, contending, this does not mean. On the contrary, what about a party member? Such a debate is not necessary. If there is power, it is 'clear and clear', so now there is no 'clear one', and the Communist Party does not have this power. 'Clear one color' itself is impossible, it is not possible in the future, so can not 'clear color' is the reflection of the objective existence, 'clear' what is bad. \\n(2), defamation of 'flowers in the whole, one hundred homes to fight', the policy is to 'step back, two progress'\\nIn the future, it is inevitable to 'step back, two steps', more smoothly take the third and fourth step. For the 'flowers are laid out, one hundred family argue' approach, I understand this way, it is a step back in mind. \\nThe proposal of the 'flowered flowers, one hundred family disputes' and 'internal contradictions among the people' is a step back in strategy. Countering the right is 'two steps forward' is 'rush march'. Clichés can not be put, old bottled new, can not put, there are class carved hatred should be put. \\n(3), Provoking the relationship between intellectuals and the party\\nReasons that intellectuals can't play should be found from the party\\nIf intellectuals do not play an active role, there are a lot of problems, because one day does not work, do work, and naturally want a lot, with the exception of some people. If it was completely Marxinist, there would be no problem with not working. This relates to why there is motivation to play not enough, or not to play it? As the opposite, is a slap does not sound, the party, some leaders in the party, to be responsible. Today, we should look for reasons from party and party leaders comrades. Because the party is the main aspect of the contradiction, it is the ruling party. At a minimum, from the party perspective, the problem is:\\n1. Valuation of intellectuals. I recall that (19), 51 years I participated in agrarian reform, and saw some situations that began only because of the transformation of their minds, and seeing the peasants are selfish and selfish, I can't see the big duke selfless, hard-working and brave. What I see is tattered and selfish. As a member of the party, see if 5 million intellectuals also see only tattered, selfish interests, rather than looking at the whole from 5 million, only individually. Individually selfish, famous views, but how to estimate the whole? Today, the problem lies in: seeing intellectuals lag behind individually and not seeing the role from the 5 million as a whole. \\n2. some party organizations, party members are not enough to analyze the characteristics of intellectuals. What are intellectuals? Most are marxist and believe in the party, but this is not equal to Marxinists, because they are not yet members of the party. Intellectuals are between, or not, there is a contradiction in itself, that is, this characteristic. I went to the data room to find a collection of Tao Yuanming poems, because most of the intellectuals today have Tao Yuanming mood. Their past has been negated, at the very least politically negated. The party does not understand this mood. Today, intellectuals have a situation of death. This is not understood by some party members or organizations. Cold face hot face, touched several times, a set of natural sentiment came. \\n3. Most of the intellectuals belong to the bourgeois category, small bourgeois, because of class status, have formed a destructive, so-called three-point hooliganism. The party did not make a proper estimate of this. In the words of the intellectuals: instead of shredded jade, not full of tiles. That's destructive. The destruction has duality that can lead to doing good things. Like the masses are destructive, and the party leads to a class struggle. So, how to estimate this destructive, understand it, better guide it, is a problem. Of course, the intellectuals also have other features, such as holistic view, self-esteem, reputation, arrogance and so on. But these have both sides. For the party, for leaders, it has guided its positive side to dominate, not a total negation. \\nThinking that the party and intellectuals have ditches, walls, uneven and can not be dismantled\\nThere are walls and ditches themselves among the parties and intellectuals, which existed in the past, present, and will exist in the future. This is a reflection of existence. Because today there are still parties and masses in society; there are activists and non-activists among the masses. This is the case at any time in the future. Therefore, shouting to demolish the wall to fill the ditch, I think it can not be dismantled, it is also uneven, there is no need to dismantle and fill, because this is a reflection of existence. It is subjectivity in anti-subjectivity; or, like Zhang is an instrument, to wipe out class, confuse understanding. The People's Daily proposed that I personally disagree. Now there are such party members who, in the whole wind, followed shouting to demolish the wall and fill the ditch. I can't understand very well. I can only say that it is a reflection of the swing. From outside the party, this part of the people outside the party is because there is no door. \\n(4), Denial of rebellion, incitement to cassation\\nThose who suffered grievances in the rebellion, talk well, my social society has taken a big opposite side. It is based on the historical conditions of Yunnan. Speaking today, in the future is not afraid of his rebellion committee. \\n(v), Distortion of cadre policy\\nIt is wrong to say that the issue of cadre policy is involved in using Weinuo. But as a reference to the king of this subjective comrade, it is necessary; it is necessary to give reference to some wino comrades. From the point of view of the development of the publishing house, from three people to now, Zhu Kun, Liu Yi and others. It is not surprising that it is not surprising that it is through the king's hands to cultivate one hand. \\n(vi), Offensive against publishing\\nAttempt to abolish party leadership for publishing, stealing leadership positions\\nThe current procedure is to make responsible editors trapped in the work of reading and returning the draft, and cannot be fully responsible for the books produced (by: meaning that no decision can be made). To change to: all submissions by the editor first look, can not be used to return, and then, the manuscript is responsible for editing, by the responsibility editor to finally handle and decide. \\nPresently, the press leadership is weak and cannot afford the final review of manuscripts. To address this problem, without changing the review process, there is a need to establish a review chamber and strengthen the review capacity. (Once established, he is willing or can act as an assistant or deputy director, who will 'share' responsibility and review manuscripts.), \\nAttempts to negate and modify the publishing guidelines of local publishers\\nIn the current situation, local publishers, especially in remote areas, have always targeted the peasant population as the primary audience. According to some of the survey materials, some difficulties arise in the sale of certain publications if farmers are the primary audience. In the face of this fact, there are two ways of thinking, one is to carefully draw up your own book writing plan to adapt to this objective situation and, within the limits of their responsibilities, to change the situation. One is to abandon the fundamental policy of 'the peasant masses with district and township cadres as the main target', and the word is changed very euphemeral and vague. In the end, not farmers should be the main target. It is clear that the former is right; the latter takes its work out of the masses and keeps itself in the circle that they define, losing the way forward, without blaming them from political concepts. People may not believe that today there is still such a disregard for the general practice, which cannot be concealed, as my work unit, Yunnan People's Publishing House. (Please refer to the Yunnan Publication Newsletter I and III, regarding the different provisions of the Yunnan People's Publishing House policy before and after the task.), The reason for doing so is simple. As already said, farmers do not have a culture at present. Farming is busy, and can't afford books. In order to benefit the business, it is said to be also to avoid 'lost direction' in the composition, it will not be lightly changed the policy task. \\nTo make a profit or not to decide whether or not to publish\\nI think it is relevant to highlight the dual nature of publications, namely, the nature of the publication as a political service and its costing as a commodity. There are some internal and external contradictions among this. To resolve these contradictions, from the publishing house, the first is a requirement for rational management. \\nAlthough some people have opinions about the local publishing work conference held last year at the central level, blame this meeting for being subjective in formulating a vision plan and a three-year work task, but the publishing house in which they work, or the publishing house in charge, has not yet been rid of this. Impact. In general, only a few hundred copies, a thousand copies of which are issued, are printed. As for the nature of the publications, the commodity nature of costing is ignored. Why this, I see the pursuit of variety numbers is an important factor. In terms of the effectiveness of publicity and education, the increase in the variety and the low amount of distribution are also unable to achieve the purpose of general and in-depth education. So why can we not focus our efforts on the specific circumstances of each region, systematically, with in-depth research and research areas, and publish a number of books with a large volume of volume in order to obtain practical results in the promotion and promotion? With regard to contentious academic manuscripts, I think there are some expedient approaches, such as some books, after cost accounting, there are difficulties in accepting publishing, and we can also introduce them to better brothers or professional publishers. If you exceed your subjective power, hard to do what you can't do for a moment, the result is only to do good things into bad things. Because of business difficulties, when the 'survival' of the publishing house really has a problem, there is no better desire to implement the policy of 'all flowers are all together, one hundred family argue' policy, I'm afraid it is also unable to do so. \\nIn the name of anti-dogmism, opposition to draft selection must have political standards\\nKnowing that uniting writers and organizing the power of social writing is the inevitable way for publishing houses to carry out their business, and is one of the fundamental tasks of the publishing house. Many publishers have made more or less efforts in this regard, and the masses and authors have so much opinion as to why the results are not good. This cannot be blamed for the dogmatism in the draft selection work and the way the eyes go up and down from the masses. For example, writings belonging to the political economy are cut off if they do not conform to the principles of Marxinism. Only one case is the exception. Zhang Guan Li Dai, the publishing house cannot discern, and non-Marxinism has also been judged as Marxinism. In the eyes of a publishing house, it is difficult to include the author's forest unless the home has become famous or the responsible cadre. As a result, many writings reserve is difficult to reach out to the publishing house. This has frustrated some people's motivation to write. Although it is clear that China does not have so many Marxinists yet, and none of the so-called famous homes are not slowly starting their homes. But we cannot do it in practice with that understanding. \\nAdvocate publication of poisons\\nIt is the Party's long-term fundamental policy for the development of culture and science. The publication itself carries out all activities under this guideline, and the effectiveness of all its activities will be measured primarily by its contribution to its implementation as the norm. It is unthinkable that the publication work should reflect both 'flowers are in full, one hundred families are contending' and attempting to rob all poisonous grass in one hand. In the ordinary sense, should there be a process of production, development, and extinction of poisonous herb? Since we admit that there are still some people, starting from their favorite, treat poisons as flowers, that means that there is also its inner life, and the fight against fragrant flowers must continue. Therefore, the attempt to rob all poisonous grass in one hand is provoked by elusive ridicule, and fully appears to be cowardly. In addition, we usually call 'safflower green leaves', 'crane chicken', if we interpret these two terms from the point of view of each other, we can also understand: safflower under the leafy set, it is very bright; if there is no chickens in the world, cranes are independent and uninhibited, will not be too Attention. The relationship between fragrant flowers and poisons has not been so. There has been a lot of discussion in newspapers and magazines on this subject, and it is a matter of note that, among our comrades in publishing, there are still concerns about works such as poisonous grass, as well as attempts to define practices, impose terms, even simply hang Signboard. Obviously, this is actually a suspicion and contradiction to the policy of 'flowers are in line, and one hundred families contested', and also suggests that these people are afraid of weather and rain. In my opinion, although this is a problem of awareness, if based on this understanding to guide their own work, of course, will not talk about the implementation of the 'flowers in all, one hundred family argue' policy, work distress will also accumulate more, swing, and eventually become a crying poor figure. \\nTo 'argue' in popular readings, 'contested' the policy of the party\\nWith regard to the provisions of the provisions, special mention should be made here. How do these people prescribe? They said that in popular reading, the publishing house could not make it contested: first, the Party's policy and policy, second, technical measures to increase production in agriculture, and three, common sense medical and health books. Since the latter two of its premises are common sense, it shows that there has been a controversy process, has been made by a family of words to become a hundred words, there is no reason to dispute, nor belong to the contested category. If someone wants to set up a family saying: say that the cream is a tonic. This kind of person may have some neurotic, otherwise it will not be explained. In addition, we may be very difficult to find other examples. As for fear of peasants being mistakenly victimized and killed by poisoning, this is even more worrisome. We should see the fact that farmers have more and more productive experience, living and class struggles than us! Come back to see whether the Party's policy and policy can be contested. I see that this is at the heart of the attempt to set out the terms, the latter two are just a complement to it. It will be particularly clear that we still talk about the facts. 'Flowers are in full, one hundred homes fight' is the Party's policy and policy! Wouldn't the famous and Soviet literary newspaper reproduced by four comrades such as Chen Qitong and other comrades, 'Some opinions on our current literary work', which is intended to propose different opinions and the Party's policy of 'flourishing together, one hundred families contested' policy? The Party's policy of 'flourishing, one hundred families contested' policy, which does not prescribe one that policy policy cannot be contested, prescribes a few people, are they not arguing with the Party's policy and policy? Only 'own' and 'fight', not 'other home' 'Ming', I see that things can not be done, and there is no reason. On the other side of the understanding of the quarters' contention, it should be to argue separately and to complement each other. The formulation of the Party's guidelines and policies is no exception, and therefore it has a magnificent life force and organizational strength. \\nOpposition to the publication of fine art works, ethnic history\\nLeaders' personal hobbies to replace the leadership bias of business leaders are not one of the reasons for some publishers. There are such publishing houses, the business situation is not good, but they do not hesitate to work locally to print publications such as album and water mining national paintings. There are also some debatable issues reflected in the selection of some publishers. Like the publishing house in remote provinces, the selection of a ministry in historical research, ranked second among the various categories. If these questions are actually published, it is difficult to raise the issue volume in the region, and also affect corporate income. Of course, there are some of the reasons why leaders who have personal preferences to replace business leaders are primarily responsible, and some have many other reasons. If, in general, this is leadership bias, I don't think too much. \\nSecond, the performance and activities in the show\\n(1), ignition, provoke, combat\\nAfter communicating the report of the provincial committee, the company began to give opinions, he said in the group: 'I have concerns. In the past, the opinion in the community will be struggled and hit. The blow is multifaceted, too.' He preached that the Forest Industry Bureau had a big democracy and pulled his comrades who thought there were some problems in mind. Seeing Comrade Fu Mingzhe did not speak much, he asked the letter: whether to look at the wind. Once again, he said to the sign, 'Shu Kung is good.' He said, 'Lei Jiaju has no courage, fear of the scarce.' 'Publishers have localism and do not pay attention to the cadres transferred from Beijing,' he said. Comrades compare the situation before and after liberation, to show that the intellectuals really have a way out after liberation, he said: saying that the situation of intellectuals before liberation is a short disclosure of intellectuals and insults the intellectuals. \\nIn presenting the Dashiming, he said: 'I have made a lot of comments in the past, but have not finished, today the issue of leadership and leadership in the company has not been resolved. It should not shift direction, this is a shift contradiction.' He said to party member Ma Wenan: 'You young members should go to Yun University and the school to see, it is good, it is exercise for you.' He said twice to party member Xu Minzhong: 'You should go to Yun University and the school to see.' He said: the publishing house has taken the opposite side, and talk about it well, he said today, he will not be afraid of his 'rebellion committee' in the future. He said: 'Improvement is only the gesture of change, but it is a change of soup and no change of medicine. Several ministers lead an officer. Change, change from the institutional level. Now the changes that you and we say are not counted. After the publication of the Anonymous Letter and the People's Daily editorial, he said in a group discussion: 'You cannot be contacted and considered because these things happen. As far as our organs are concerned, the problems raised are to be resolved, and there is no need to contact the right. The list of welfare expenses subsidies should be announced immediately. Like the medical school announced, it shows a lot of things, that is, stolen.' \\nPang Wen will say at the meeting that the party member Xu Minzhong was only confused. Facing Xu Minzhong, he said: You should take a firm stand and play a supervisory role. What should you talk about. When Comrade Xu Minzhong gave him a positive reply, Pang made a positive attack on Xu. When Comrade Fang Fengqin gave his opinion to Xu Min, Pang immediately provoked: 'Xu Minzhong and Jiang Zi-wen have been good people in organizing struggles. What will be about such a stolen matter today?' When Pang want party member Ma Wenan went to Yunda and the division did not work, he scolded on the group: 'A young Communist Party member like Ma Wenan who does not eat much salt water, I do not ask for much.' When comrades criticized his opposition party, anti-socialist rhetoric and bad attitude, Pang attacked the comrades who made opinions without giving a positive response. He said at the meeting: Comrade Liu Yi was cultivated by bourgeois education. It will only form logic and three paragraphs of theory. He said Comrade Chao Sixun is 'the activist cultivated in the various sports, will only blow the beard and stare eyes. Now it is good to not blow, not stare, what else is required?' \\nIn the repudiation of the right-wing speech, Ponwen will say: People are afraid of reactionary remarks, what is this afraid of the field? It is not surprising that 80% of comrades here, including some imperfect party members, have several right-wing qualities, except for some purely party members. \\n(2), distortion, falsification, two-sided approach\\nHe preached that 'every campaign of the party is aimed at the whole person.' He said: He explained one thing, based on the work report of Chow's government. He said: It is not relevant to say two reactionaries. It is to quote Comrade Lee Weihan's report. When comrades had revealed his anti-party and anti-socialist words and deeds, he had to say to you: 'Comrades are factual and excerpts are basically factual; at present I am grateful'. He said that his remarks should be discussed, while writing a report to the provincial committee, said that comrades were 'slandering criticism' of him, and that 'criticism does not hesitate to fabricate facts', the publishing house leader is intentional to complete him. \\n(3), Cover for the right-wing, KMT\\nWhen rejecting the 'clear and one-size-fits-all' argument, he said: Chuanping is only theoretical ignorance. Comrade said that Huang Shaohong and Lu Guofan were slag. He said: Not slag, there are good or bad. Turning to the Kuomintang Central News Agency, he said: The Central Society is a hub for the KMT's contentious struggle. \\nHe thinks: whether there are still intractable episodes in the work of the party, which cannot be discussed. So what about receiving it? I think the cases that have been revealed are serious enough. But as a whole, the Yangzi Company and the Cooperative Treasury have not yet appeared, so the Communist Party is not afraid to receive it. \\n(4), play rogue\\nComrades have just criticized him, he said: 'He was not the wind and rain, it was stormy. Make a public request to the leader to withdraw from the meeting. Comrade Wang Qi said to him: Do you consider not to participate in the future, okay? He immediately added 'political consequences', saying that the leadership asked him to consider political consequences. He said that the leadership 'intentionally directed', comrades made 'unreasonable criticism' of him. \\nWhen these practices did not work and were publicly accused, he said to be reviewed. This was followed by a statement for almost four hours, in which questions were either left unanswered or merely dealt with. The so-called thought censorship is a repetition of 54 years of thought censorship, narrowness, suspicion, bias, organizational discipline, popular opinion, criticism of self-criticism, but some changes have been made in examples. Even sentences are the same. [Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (Communist Party of China)\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】'Jiangxi Daily': 'The bourgeois political ambition, attacking party,' Peng xianyin Xianyin, a right-wing member of the division college has been revealed' (1957.8.22)\\n[News] From the beginning of July to August 16, Jiangxi Normal University held a number of symposia, and ruthlessly excuses and refuted the right-wing member Peng xianyin Xianyin, proving that he is a long-hidden bourgeois political ambition. At present, the ugly face of Peng xianyin Xianyin's anti-socialist anti-party anti-socialism has been unveiled, and the lost hearts of the bourgeois defenders have all been revealed. \\nImpacting the Pioneer of Party Commission\\nIn Daming, Peng xianyin Xianyin proposed three times to abolish the party committee system in higher schools and implement 'professors to manage schools'. He openly shouted: 'I also propose to abolish the party committee system in schools', 'do not have to be the party committee or party members personally as leaders', 'Party members leading cadres, or general cadres, are not aware of business... rely solely on Marxinism who do not understand business... can not lead'. Agree to 'professor of school'. In several statements, in order to achieve the leadership of his opposition party in schools, he did not hesitate to fabricate and distort the facts, slander, provoke party relations and attack Communist Party members. He hard said that 'party organizations are arranged instead'. Non-party cadres 'have no right to work' is the main contradiction in the school. The defaming non-party personalities are 'god cards' and 'rubber stamps'. He opposes the chairman of the party member's capture of the teaching and proposed that 'party members, members of the Democratic Party and trade unions, old teachers and young teachers organize themselves together by party members, members of the Democratic Party and trade unions, old teachers and young teachers. 'In essence, the Party Committee withdraws from the school, giving them such a so-called experienced old professor to power; he also fabricated that The college 'does not distinguish between party and government', saying that all departments have secretaries and party books 'the head of the department did not work well'; he also viciously provoked the relationship between the Party and intellectuals, saying that the Party did not trust senior intellectuals. 'Only education does not have unity,' and directly quoted Qian Weichang's words, 'Please help the scientists!'' , further slander said: 'Chinese experts... are generally not valued', 'grass-roots cadres, they look down on experts, violate party policies, arbitrarily destroy', put forward slanderous slogans 'to tighten the protection of existing experts', etc. Consider these lies and slander as his 'pretext' against the school party system. \\nIn fact, Peng xianyin Xianyin's opposition party leadership of schools has a long history. As early as two years ago, he sang 'unnecessary party organizations to lead' and said publicly last year: 'Professor to manage schools is the direction of the future development of higher schools'; when he is facing the party's application, he said to people on the other side: 'The party absorbs people who are dying (referring to the older ones), into it, is loaded with the facade.' , 'There is no benefit for intellectuals to join the party. There are many old party members in the party. Senior intellectuals are only a small party member, and it is better to join the League.' 'Don't believe too much' the school party committee, 'they are useless', and so on. In short, Peng xianyin Xianyin has resorted to distortion, fabrication, slander, and vicious methods to combat the school party committee, portraying the Party Committee as the root cause of all contradictions in the school, and is a 'abominable' 'sectarianist', thus achieving the despicable purpose of inciting the masses in order to abolish the party system. \\nAttacks revolt and cry 'rehabilitate'\\nPeng xianyin Xianyin slander Party members and cadres have a low level of culture and cannot lead the rebellion, thus fundamentally denying the major achievements of rebellion. He slandered the anti-movement 'a lot of bias' and said what: 'Senior intellectuals believed to be suspected have suffered a lot of grievances in the movement, suffered a lot of hardship and even insulted by physical confinement, and as a result, the vast majority of them were not bad guys.' The spirit of openly advocating against the object is 'to kill, not humiliate', and to shout for the counter-revolutionaries, further attempt to abolish the people's democratic dictatorship, slandered that 'party members violate policy, even violate law and discipline' and 'violate human rights' and 'guarantee the right of victims to complain in accordance with article 97 of the Constitution' 'Lee', arrogant should be punished against anti-cadres. He was extremely sympathetic to opposing objects and historical counter-revolutionaries. He said to Wu Shidong, who was opposed at the time, he said that he 'can't help'. 'If I deal with the problem of rebellion, then the man will not have any problem'; he slandered the leadership of the house to 'misarranged' against the opponents and claimed to develop a historical counter-revolutionary. Joining the Union; after he and anti-opponents hook up, consolation and encouragement, many of the opposing objects flock up, concentrating Attacking the anti-rebellion movement, one of the opposing objects actually proposed the establishment of a rehabilitation committee, with the focus of counteraction as its members, in an attempt to reverse the case completely, while Peng xianyin Xianyin himself publicly proposed at the meeting that he should thoroughly carry out the repudiation work. The punishment of anti-cadres is punished in accordance with article 97 of the Constitution. He even said, 'Wu Shidong's agent is impossible. How can a professor be an agent? Wu was only teaching in the reactionary era.' Not only did it express deep sympathy for some of the opposing objects, but also sheltered and colluded them. Peng xianyin Xianyin and some of the objectionist objects, focused on attacking the anti-rebellion movement in an attempt to overthrow the entire case and abolish the people's democratic dictatorship. \\nIgnition everywhere poison fear the world is not mess\\nPeng xianyin Xianyin not only denigrated the Party's mistrust of senior intellectuals and distorted 'unity-education-unity' as 'education-education' or 'neither education nor unity' in order to create intellectuals grievances with the Party, but also occupies himself as protectors of teachers in general, especially primary and secondary school teachers. In the early days of revelation, maliciously set fire: 'Teachers are human soul engineers... is an empty word, far from raising them to their rightful status', 'the contradictions between primary and secondary teachers and leaders are quite many and serious' to 'let them shine out in a timely and adequate manner', in an attempt to put Fire to the grass-roots level; in the hospital, from party members and cadres at the head of section level and lecturers, assistant teachers, teachers Opposing academic and administrative positions, teachers school streets should be used to overwhelm administrative positions, create contradictions and discontent and provoke the fire to attack the party; fabricate rumors that party members and non-party vice-presidents 'rarely speak their mind' and 'unreconcile' in order to provoke relations and ignite poison; put the fake NLD on the abolition of party committee system Communicate and internal documents to foreign teachers to listen to them to expand publicity and win the masses; personally fight against objects, and put A paragraph in his speech about the attack against the opponent was read to hear, encourage the object to write a letter on the complaint; in the house, he said, 'Something is not good to do, I do not know whether it is the party committee leader, or the leadership of the council committee', or implied to someone: 'A Mr. wants to make clear, if he doesn't make it now, don't sound again in the future. ', have the opportunity to force people to narrate, otherwise they say that people have concerns; in the provincial committee meeting of the mission, This newspaper reporter introduced the situation of looking for opposition objects Wu Shidong and other talks, trying to burn the fire even more fierce through the reporter. \\nUsing the leadership position of the NLD branch in the Faculty to implement the instructions of Zhangluo Alliance and Xu Liu Group\\nPeng xianyin Xianyin himself said that in 1953, he had contact with Zhang Bojun and Luolongki. Xu Deyuan often encouraged his dissatisfaction with the current situation. He also followed Xu Deyuan's instructions to absorb middle and backward people into the League, doing more work among professors, and took the initiative to absorb opposing objects into the League. After serving as chairman of the NLD branch last year, he actively introduced his classmate and right-wing activist Hu Zhaomian to join the Union, and deceived other members of the branch, saying: 'Hu Chaomian has always been clear in history and thought progress,' in order to pull into private expansion. He is also ready to develop Wu Shidong and Zhu Qixia to join the Union; and preach the Democratic Party. Send dignitaries and the Communist Party equally, the chamber resists, saying: 'Now different before, everything is up to them (referring to the communist), Party), can now contend, can supervise'. \\nPro-American anti-Soviet ideology against Marxinism\\nPeng xianyin Xianyin repeatedly stressed that the school party committee 'has no experience in running school', 'rely solely on Marxinism does not understand business'. 'It will certainly use simple and hard methods', suggesting that dogmatism hinders school development. He erases the role of political ideology and education, saying that 'cannot solve the problem completely', mathematics are all debating materialism. The content of mathematics without Marxinism, negates this basic principle of political guidance business. Therefore, for learning the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, it is substantively mixed with the British and American experience. The four-level scoring method has also been used in the past. He said: The United States has long had a scoring method of A, B, C, D, and oral examinations and classroom discussions, and it was dogmatic to learn the Soviet teaching experience. He also tried to have teachers play the guiding ideology of the American bourgeois in teaching. For example, Wang Yanyu wants to write pedagogical lectures, he introduced many books on American pedagogical law, and introduced Mr. Xiong Zhengjiu to read articles on pedagogical law in the United States magazine in order to promote American bourgeois. The National Police did well and did not normally see the police, but when something happened, the police immediately found it; he often Listening to the Voice of America did not stop, and after the publication of the Reference Message, an excuse was found to muddle their children, sounded unscrupulously and spread to people. \\nInsist on reactionary stance, refusing to talk about\\nSince the anti-right struggle, a step-by-step approach to retreat has been used to conceal its reactionary bourgeois position, seeking to retreat. He has repeatedly claimed that his 'motivation is good' at various meetings, only objectively played the anti-socialist role, and his right-wing speech was unconscious. When the masses rejected his 'unconscious theory,' he wrote an article 'On the institutional problems of higher education', trying to conceal the ideological nature of his anti-partisan anti-socialist ideology and manipulating political issues into academic ones. When this technique was debunked, they came to make a false review in an attempt to deny that he was a right-wing, attacking himself with a simple political opinion, fame ideology, arrogance, liberalism, and so on, and refusing to account for key issues. The masses further pointed out that his methods of resistance were: first, to cover up his two-factions with the affirmative side and the negative side, saying, 'Usually speaking to the party leadership, it will be blurred up on a specific issue, saying that his theory is out of practice and pretends to be a person who commits dogmatic mistakes. Second, turning the entire programmatic anti-party words and deeds into isolated pieces, without touching the ideas and realities, even the original The narrative is also isolated for some painless explanations; the third is to turn historical roots and class roots into an abstract little hat to hide the real insider. It was pointed out that he was using ideological reactionaries to hide political reactionaries and hollow criticism to cover up his reactionary words and deeds. At the same time, he pointed out that Peng xianyin should continue to account for his relationship with Xu De-yuan. \\nPeng xianyin Xianyam is a long-hidden bourgeois political ambition\\nAfter more than a month of struggles, Peng xianyin Xianyin's representations still has no new progress, provoking unparalleled anger among the masses. On August 16, all faculty and staff gathered all day long to expose Peng xianyin Xianyin and criticize Peng xianyin Xianyin, noting that Peng xianyin Xianyin is a long-hidden bourgeois political ambition. Speakers made strong and reasonable denunciations and rebuttal on issues such as the abolition of the party committee system and attacks against rebellion. \\nShao Hechun and Wu Jun said in a joint statement that one of the fundamental guarantees and necessary conditions for the realization of socialism is the leadership of the Party. And one of the main elements of the anti-socialist right-wing conspiracy is to seize the leadership of the Party in various causes and lead China to the path of capitalism. They pointed out that Peng xianyin Xianyin's anti-party activities are precisely the implementation of the anti-socialist conspiracy of Zhang Luo Xu Liu's right-wing group in the teacher training college. Peng xianyin Xianyin's anti-socialist platform is part of Zhang Luo Xu Liu's platform. Peng xianyin Xianyin's platform is the opposition party's leadership of higher education, and the introduction of 'professors and colleges'. One of the bases of his theory is that disinformation is disguised, describing the correct leadership of the Party in higher education as the root of sectarianism. The rationale behind the second is to denigrate party members and cadres as laymen, do not understand business, singing the so-called 'layman cannot lead the insider' in an attempt to force the party to withdraw from higher education. The speaker asked: since liberation, the number of students in higher education has increased from 116,000 to 440,000 this year. In the first five-year plan, about 60 new colleges were opened, and the research institutes of the Academy of Sciences have been extended to (and cannot be recognized here). Wouldn't these achievements have been achieved by the right leadership of the Communist Party? Isn't the so-called 'outsiders can't lead the insider' is not self-breaking? They pointed out that the so-called insiders, experienced and understandable business should refer to new socialist colleges. Therefore, those who do not have experience and ignorance in this regard (cannot be recognized by word), are the right elements such as Peng xianyin Xianyin. \\nMr. Yang Xinghua said: The reason that Peng xianyin Xianyin was able to propose anti-socialist anti-party anti-socialist platform is not accidental, but the origin (cannot be recognized here)! After describing the activities of Peng xianyin Xianyin's sectarianist activities, self-bragging, backwardness, combating progress, using the NLD branch as a tool of resistance to the party committee chambers in schools, and making the Scientific Research Office (not recognized here), as an independent kingdom, he further pointed out that his anti-party anti-socialist and It is not isolated. He has contacts with right-wing elements in all directions. It is to actively implement the policy of Zhangluo development allies, Xu Liu The instructed commissioner, together with the 'Party World' of Chu Anping, on a nostril out (can't be recognized here), for Qian Weichang's 'Please save the scientists!' A reprint (not recognized here); it is a right-wing element in the garment of a scientist, home or professor who has long been engaged in anti-socialist conspiracy within the people. \\nZhang Jinzhi, Ouyang Chen and Guo Zhongxi □ counter issues forcefully refuted. Ou Yang Chen pointed out: 'How can a professor be a secret agent' is not only provocation, but also a lie. He pointed out that Zeng Mian, a former professor at the 'Zhongzheng University', was suppressed in Nanchang, who was the secretary of Jiang Bangjun and the head of the Nanchang school transport team Peng xianyin Xianyin 'love can help' Wu Shidong, so why is Wu Shidong Xu people? Ouachen cited Wu Shitong's reactionary history and the evils and facts before liberation. Finally, he pointed out: Peng xianyin Xianyin has repeatedly been historical counter-revolutionaries, grievances and struggles with them, so you can see what position he is standing and why people have spoken. Ou Yang also used many facts to refute Peng xianyin Xianyin's 'physical confinement', 'illegal discipline' and so on. \\nThese denunciations and reprimands, Peng xianyin Xianyin has always been hidden and clever face tear. His bourgeois political ambitions and the minds of the fallen class are even more exposed. It was unanimously pointed out that Peng xianyin Xianyin's attempts to recalcitrant and confuse it is impossible, because he has been known clearly. The leadership group of the NLD branch of the Shore Academy pointed out that: the right, Peng xianyin Xianyin, has no way out of his consciousness. At the same time, the most important thing is that all faculty and staff both inside and outside insist on relentless struggles, forcing him to surrender his arms and bow to the people. \\nThe struggle against the right, Peng xianyin Xianyin, continues to be deepened. (Originally titled 'bourgeois political ambitions and attacking the party's 'mighty generals', Peng xianyin Xianyin, a right-wing member of the division college has been revealed, and faculty members of the entire hospital are deeply exposing and continuing to pursue, Jiangxi Daily 1957.8.22)\\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached 2] Zhou Shuren: 'Don't allow Peng xianyin Xianyin to sell American bourgeois private goods. We want to adhere to learning the advanced experience of the Soviet Union' (1957.8.22)\\nThe anti-right struggle is a politically ideological socialist revolutionary movement. Through the revelations and criticism of the right-wing elements, we see that the rightists in learning the advanced experience of the Soviet Union are also spoken in the guise of 'advocating pedagogical reform' and 'advocating learning of the Soviet Union', but in essence they used covert methods to attack. The right-wing elements, on the one hand, try to make the best use of fish and desperation to replace the advanced experience of socialism with the bourgeois experience; on the other hand, they exaggerate shortcomings and erase achievements in order to attack the major achievements of learning the Soviet Union and pedagogical reform. \\nWe must therefore analyse and refute, theoretically and in fact, the hidden activities of the right-wing elements. \\nNow, first of all, look at why we should learn the best experience of the Soviet Union. \\nIn the history of modern education in China, 100 years ago, we were invaded by imperialism. The Manqing Dynasty had to abolish the establishment of the Science Hing School and the Higher School, and so far exactly 95 years, initially studying from Britain, from Japan in the middle, and later from the United States until the collapse of the KMT reactionary. Capitalist science and technology have little to learn, such as the science of atomic energy, which is a weapon of imperialist aggression, and some achievements in industry are the secret of the market competition for bourgeois industrialists; some science and technology, even if they learn, are heroes and have no prospects for development. Old China is a semi-feudal semi-colonial society, so our old university fully demonstrates the educational nature of semi-feudal semi-colonial societies. I remember the Southwest General Assembly during the Resistance War, the Philosophy Department of the Faculty of Arts, the Faculty of Science, the faculty lineup of teachers in the old university was the strongest in the country, but the students did not have more than Mr.. What is this reason? In one word, there is no way out. \\nAs Chairman Mao said, 'The Chinese have learned very much from the West, but they do not work, and ideals can never be realized.' And this capitalist 'sir is invading students'. \\nWhy should we learn the Soviet Union today? Because we want to build socialism. Socialist countries are selfless, socialist experience has been accumulated in the USSR for 40 years. The basic and main part of these experiences is universally applicable to all socialist countries. It has a role to learn and guide us in building socialism, as long as we are good at practicing from China. To apply the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, it has no advantages and disadvantages for us to build socialism. So Chairman Mao has long taught us: 'We want to carry out great nation-building, the work ahead of us is hard, our experience is not enough. Therefore, we need to study carefully the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Whether within the Communist Party, outside the Communist Party, old cadres, new cadres, technicians, intellectuals, workers and farmers alike, must learn from the Soviet Union in good faith. We need to learn not only the theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, but also the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union. We want to set the climax of learning the Soviet Union nationwide to build our country.' \\nWhen the right-wing rampant attacks on the party, they put forward slogans such as 'insider', 'experts', 'experience' and so on. What kind of 'insider', 'expert', 'experience' are these? The right-wing elements attempted to use the technique of mixed fish, stealing the day to day, to guide people to learn the British and American, towards the old path of capitalism, equate the US-British experience with the Soviet experience, confuse new and old universities, and boast of the experience of capitalist higher education in order to achieve defamation of the Soviet side of learning from the Soviet Union. Needle policy. \\nWe know that there are two different educational systems between countries with two different systems, and rightists only see their apparent similarities, but rather ask about their essential differences. The right-wing elements are used to make such a tactic. \\nI remember last year in the province asked a Soviet expert to introduce the Soviet education experience and answer the problems encountered in learning from the Soviet experience. Soviet experts humbly made a few comments, and Peng xianyin Xianyin distorted it. It was hard to say as if the Soviet experts all said we did not respect Chinese experts, and regrettably attacked the Party. Policy for senior intellectuals. Could this report not be answered by Chinese experts in the Soviet Union? I don't think the Soviet experts themselves would think that way. \\nAt the same time, Peng xianyin Xianyin has always publicized American and British experience, such as saying to Mr. Wang Yanyang: To compile teaching methods, he has many American teaching law books for his reference. To Mr. Xiong Zhengjiu said: American teachers also draw up their experience, but also focus on intuitive teaching aids, American magazines also published articles on teaching laws, teaching principles also exist in the United States; four-level division system, oral examination, classroom discussion. \\nThose who learn the advanced education experience of the Soviet Union are not unaware that many educational experiences have been introduced and applied in the emerging era of capitalism, but some experiences have been practiced in socialist countries to be critically accepted and flourished, and in times of capitalism. Turn it into a reactionary educational tool. Recall that last year's Spring Festival NLD dinner, the right-wing activists Xu Deyuan and Peng xianyin Xianyin at the same time talked about the need to take a large class of several hundred people after the development of primary and secondary schools. This is precisely the class-teaching system of reactionary education in the United States and Britain that was criticized by Soviet pedagogy, that is, the ugly notorious 'Beel Lancaster system', is a cheap form of teaching organization that deceives the working people of the proletarian class. \\nIn terms of intuitive teaching aids and intuitiveness principles, our aim is for students to understand deeply, to enable students to gain thorough theoretical knowledge from sensory to rational understanding; it is also the main way in which theory is linked to reality. But reactionary pragmatism educators, in promoting the principle of intuitiveness, are fundamentally different from us. They are simply to train workers to become accessories to machines, easy to grasp the practical operation of simple tools, only at the stage of emotional awareness, not to develop into deep theories. \\nAt the NLD panel meeting of the Department of Mathematics, Peng xianyin also said that colleges in mainland Europe and the United States have only a few hours a week; some students do not have to attend classes as long as students test, and American colleges have fewer hours per week than we do. The blindly bragging of this message is extremely harmful to our new type of university. On the one hand, this shows two different economic systems, such as the exceptionally long holidays at the University of Oxford and its very short duration, just a reflection of the British aristocratic bourgeoisie tradition, with a handful of millionaire children who have always focused on learning at home, home teachers and private book equipment, with us wide Large children of workers and farmers live in a different environment, and that is a university that only a few exploitative class children can enter. On the other hand, it also shows the decay of bourgeois colleges. The past Shanghai Pheasant University, Peking University in the era of North Ocean Warlord, can graduate. Many international students at Columbia University School of Education in the United States only need to take a few credits and get a master's degree in less than a year. Not a tooth for the Chinese education community. As long as the exams do not attend classes, it is even more necessary to restore the feudal system of science and discipline. Our new type of colleges today is to give students a comprehensive system of scientific knowledge that can be allowed to take an extremely decadent liberal approach! \\nThe right-wing elements bring out the US-British experience everywhere, they will not follow Chairman Mao's instructions to 'carefully learn the advanced experience of the Soviet Union,' and often describe the real advanced experience of the people as dogmatism, because they do not learn from the Soviet Union sincerely and sincerely, they cannot understand the spirit of the advanced socialism experience. Quality. Why do right-wing elements do this? Isn't this to elevate their academic status, pretend themselves as 'experienced' 'insiders' and 'experts' in an attempt to knock down what they call 'layman' party members, and finally abolish the party's leadership? \\nSecond, let's analyze what we learn about the major achievements of the Soviet Union. \\nNow we only look at the cause of people's education and the main achievements: the first is the consolidation of the working-class political party-the Communist Party's leadership in the cause of people's education. \\nThis is manifested in the following three areas:\\nIdeally established Marxist Leninism as guiding the cause of people's education, using Marxist Leninism's position, views and methods to change the old system of higher education, educational content and teaching methods. Its basic steps are to organize political learning, reform of ideas, criticize mentalism, draw the boundaries of enemies and establish a dialectical materialist world view of the working class. \\nPolitically transform schools at all levels into venues for propagating the general tasks of the Party and the Government and for the general tasks of the transitional period and for the various national construction undertakings, so that the cause of education of the people serves the political tasks of the country's political route. \\nThe organization has set up party organizations at all levels and the Communist Youth League under the leadership of the Party, education trade unions, democratic parties and young pioneers organizations, so that the working class has provided organizational guarantees for the leadership of the people's education. \\nIn short, the leadership of the working-class Communist Party in the cause of the people's education has been firmly established in ideological, political and organizational terms. This is one of the fundamental achievements of the educational community in China's educational community and educational reform of the Soviet Union. It is also the socialist cause of people's education and capitalist society as a bourgeois. The main difference between the old education of the level of service. \\nSecondly, it ensures the development direction of socialism in the cause of education of the people. \\nThis is manifested in two aspects:\\nIn terms of changing student composition, higher education has initially implemented the approach of opening the door to workers and farmers. Before liberation, the children of workers and peasants had no access to university. With the increase in the income of workers and farmers and the improvement of material life after liberation, the number of students from working and farm families in higher education has increased significantly, for example 1952, 1952 students from higher education schools, 40,000 of whom were from industrial and peasant families, 20.5 per cent; in 1956, 45% of students in higher education 0.8,000 people, of whom 139,000 people were born from industrial and agricultural families, the share of 34.1%. The figures used above do not include the children of ordinary employees in terms of the origin of workers and farmers who work in manual work. This is also a fact never seen in China's history. \\nIn terms of adjusting the professional setting, higher education has basically implemented the policy of service for production and construction. For example, in the 20 years of reactionary rule of the Kuomintang from 1928 to 1948, there were only 157 graduates of higher schools, of which 50,000 graduates in political and law were the first, while few were in engineering and agriculture. The new China has changed this unreasonable situation, with more than 360,000 graduates since its founding, including 96,000 engineering graduates, more than twice as many as many engineering graduates in old China in more than 50 years combined. There are more than 320 specialties set up in higher schools in China, including 188 specialties in engineering, thus adapting to the construction needs of our country's industrialization. This is by no means anarchy, but something that capitalist higher education cannot do. Only learning from the Soviet Union can guarantee the socialist orientation of the nation-building plan. \\nThird, the quality of people's education has been improved. \\nThis is also manifested in the following three aspects:\\nCurriculum development in the curriculum is a comprehensive approach to education, ensuring the development of fully developed professional personnel in higher education institutions. \\nCurriculum and textbooks fully incorporate the most advanced scientific and technological achievements, while also ensuring complete teaching content, basically in accordance with the pedagogical progress. Teachers of old colleges taught freely and generally have never completed a single course. \\nThe teaching methodology focuses on theoretical linkages and teaching principles, in particular the strengthening of experimental internships, and measures have been taken to improve the quality of classroom teaching. \\nIn short, the results we learned from the Soviet Union are remarkable, and here is just a casual example to see. However, learning from the advanced experiences of others cannot be without shortcomings, for example, sometimes the spirit and substance of the advanced experiences of others is not sufficiently understood to achieve the desired effect; sometimes in combination with China's actual inadequacy, it may also exist; but, after all, achievements are major, only On this basis continue to improve. \\nHowever, the right-wing elements, during the revelation, collected materials to learn about the Soviet Union's dogmatism and prepared articles to be published in the party newspaper. \\nWhat is Pang Xianyin for? \\nOur departments and departments have also received instructions from the Central Ministry of Higher Education in April, the first of which is to summarize the main experience of higher education work since the founding of the nation, and that the summary work must be factually affirming achievements, identifying shortcomings, and treating the problems with the perspective of historical development, and making concrete work. Analyze, prevent one-sided ideological tendencies that affirm everything and negate everything. \\nBut Peng xianyin Xianyin, as deputy provost, should properly investigate and research according to the instructions of his superiors. Why is it private to instruct all parties to specialize in learning the shortcomings in the Soviet Union? Isn't this deliberately exaggerated shortcomings and erase achievements in order to distort the facts and reach the policy of attacking the Soviet Union's policy of learning? \\nAlthough the tactics of the right-wing elements are hidden, they can be seen under the criticism of the masses.

Peng xianzan is a youth team member, Hunan province, 23 years old. His stepfather was a secret agent, and his mother had no life after liberation because her husband was arrested and had asked for food, so Peng xianzan was very dissatisfied with the Party. After the beginning of 'Ming' and 'put', Peng xianzan organized a 'cattle house' in the hospital, self-deputy president, making right-wing remarks and opposing positive opinions. He also organized a counter-debate. After the anti-right struggle began in the hospital, the party and the group collected his material, for his knowledge and felt panic. Meanwhile, the editorial department of 'Butterfly' held a meeting to expose right-wing remarks, and also focused on him alone. Many large print newspapers have asked what the direction of 'cattle fly' is, why is it spreading right-wing speech, and who is responsible? He saw greater momentum. On July 1, Tou Jiang committed suicide. This situation has been reported to the secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee. Provincial party secretary Xu Daoqi instructed the court not to influence the conduct of anti-right struggles as a result. The court has announced the matter to the whole house, and further expose Peng xianzan's right-wing remarks, and the League Committee also announced the dismissal of Peng xianzan's group. It is said that the students reflected well. \\nThe suicide attempt was Yang Zejun, a philosophical teacher of Marxism Teaching and Research Group of Hubei Medical College. He was born from the landlord's family and his father was in re-education. Yang wrote eight old poems of right-wing remarks in this 'Ming' and 'put'. According to comrades from the Party Committee of Medicine College, the Academy did not consider making Yang a right. It was only that everyone ordered him and questioned his intention to write those poems. Yang disagreed with the big print rebuttal and asked for a debate, and the college promised him to hold a debate on the afternoon of the 3rd. Yang injected five morphine needles before the meeting and wrote a 'deadly book'. At the opening of the debate, Yang attended and made a statement. To be said, the face changed halfway, the mouths spit white foam and fainted. With emergency hospital treatment, life is no longer in danger.

It is rumored to wear young people as a result of forced migration when they were deceived and tied up by the Han in that year. In this regard, Li Congguo has no doubt. \\nLi Congguo was an official, and now went to the sea, floating unhindered, but suffered by identity. On his identity card, the national column is marked as the Miao, but he always wants to explain to people: 'I am not the Miao, I am wearing young people, I am the first doctor to wear young people.' \\nMost of the time, the other person will ask further: 'What is wearing a young man?' In the past, Li from Congress did not hesitate to roll up his sleeves to show people the trumps on the arm. Today, the body is blessed and the traces are no longer obvious, and the interpretation of this issue is getting weaker and less. \\nMore people are never aware of the problem, they have never heard of the name 'wear young people'. In the Mainland's official ethnic statistics, young people are considered Han ethnic groups. For decades in the history of the Republic, young people who did not agree with this delineation, but today, this group remains unidentified, and in ethnographic circles, the group of young people who wear young people is known as 'identified'. \\nWhy does an unidentifiable nation come to this point, to trace the cause and effect, to uncover the past 60 years ago. \\nConcealed Ethnic Identification\\nIn 2006, Yang Ran, Ph.D., Central University for Nationalities, wrote his doctoral thesis, 'The Study of Youth Wear'. The paper began with citing data such as the fifth population census, indicating that the young people are mainly distributed in Bijie, Anshun and Liupanshui city in northwest Guizhou Province, with a population of about 670,000 people in Guizhou province, accounting for 1.7% of the population of the province. Among them, Zhijin and Nayong counties are the largest, 230,000 and 225,000 respectively. His nation was in a situation of large and small agglomeration. \\nNow more than old Zhang Chengkun, was born in Qianxi County Zhijin. In the memory of the young through the house, the temple is always particularly solemn, the grandmother comb three heads told him, this is the god of the young man. A little older, he saw people in town often fights with Han people, and everyone called the hostile Han people called 'piercing the blue.' In the exchange of grace between the blue and the blue, the young Zhang Chengkun had the initial concept of identity. \\nIn the view of the young people, the historical record of their own ethnic group can be traced back to the Song Yuan period, when Guizhou already has a record of 'native people', and 'native' is the predecessor of 'wear young people', whose origin can be traced from ancient 'Wuxi Man'. Entering Mingqing, the arrival of the Han immigrant group gradually gave the 'native people' the opportunity to integrate and be understood. At that time, people called wearing young people as 'people', 'Zhongjia' and so on. The name of 'wear green' is also seen at the beginning of the Ming, he said, is different from the Han people who 'wear the blue' at the time, later, with the blazing contradictions of Qinglan, gradually become self-proclaimed. \\nThe origin of the family name, similar to the title, the history of the entire ethnic group, is also dispersed in the Han literature, but the hatred of the Han group for centuries is truly true. In Zhang Chengkun's memory, the contradictions of Qinglan were not gradually ended until after the establishment of the Republic. On January 8, 1950, the Communist army peacefully liberated the weave. Two years later, land reform began, and centuries of inter-ethnic issues gave way to class struggles. \\nAt this time, the continent is undergoing radical changes. The Communist Party of the new government promised ethnic equality and was determined to exercise ethnic regional autonomy. Thus, a national statistics column has been set up in the registration of the Civil Registry of Land Change. That is why the complex ethnic situation presented by Guizhou's agrarian reform institute has brought to the attention of the Chinese Communist Party rulers. For the first time, foreign rulers knew the name of wearing young people, so in that year, representatives of Dafang County of Guizhou were invited to visit Beijing. The invitation to national representatives to visit Beijing is one of the important tools for ethnic equality in the early years of the Republic as a means of promoting inter-ethnic understanding. \\nIn 1950, it was a young Turkish woman from Yongshun, Hunan, who questioned the national identity during his visit to Beijing as a Miao ethnic group and opened the curtain of national identification work on the mainland. \\nIn 1953, the first census began on the mainland, and at the same time, ethnic identification was carried out. The identification of young people in Guizhou began in 1955. At that time, the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress appointed Fei Xiaotong, vice-president and sociologist of the Central Institute for Nationalities, to lead the investigation, accompanied by two professors of the Central Institute for Nationalities: linguist Wang Jingru and anthropologist Song Shuhua. \\nFei Xiaotong arrived in Guizhou in late March of that year, and immediately formed a task force with the Guizhou Provincial Committee for Ethnic Affairs, the Guizhou Provincial Institute for Nationalities and the National Affairs Commission of the regions and counties with national identification missions to begin an ethnic identification investigation into the three ethnic groups of the young, the Long family and the Cai family. \\nHowever, according to Wang Dianhua, who became the director of the Zhijin County Ethnic Affairs Committee in the 1980s, recalled that the first national identification survey led by Fei Xiaotong was to investigate mountain production work outside. At that time, Fei Xiaotong was the captain, Li Fangyao and Wang Jingru were deputy captains, and sent to Bijie area to conduct ethnic investigation teams. The internal name was 'Guizhou Province National Identification Task Force', but the external called 'Guizhou Mountain Production Reformation Task Force'. Following this, the Bijie area's working group sent to Zhijin County is called 'Ethnic Identification Working Group', externally called 'Mountain Production Visit Group'. The same working group was sent to Nayong County called 'Mountain Production Survey Group' and 'Mountain Production Reformation Task Force' sent to Dading County, essentially the same name. But each organic. \\nFrom a meeting in Guiyang on 25 March and returning to Guiyang on 4 August, the ethnic investigation continued for a total of 53 days. During the period, visits were made to places such as the frame, eight steps, cinnamo, cattle farm, horse farm, and Shagoose Township in Qingzhen County, mainly to investigate genealogy, Yanyan County, including 'Pingyuan Zhi', 'Anshun Fuzhi', 'Dading Fuzhi', including local history-and To carry out interviews with the young elderly, study the dialect of 'old life words' and so on. \\nAt that time, Fei Xiaotong had personally visited the weaving gold introspection town, and Peng xuchu Xu, who was deputy director of the Civil Commission of Zhijin County, had accompanied the whole trip, but during the visit, Peng xuchu Xuchu did not understand that the contents of the examination were national identification. Until August 24, after the visit, the National Identification Task Force held a working summary meeting in Guiyang. On that day, Peng xuchu Xuchu learned for the first time that the investigation involved an examination of the ethnic components of the young people. \\nA paper written by Fei Xiaotong and others called the 'Survey Report on the Ethnic Composition of the Young People in Guizhou Province' was announced at the work wrap-up meeting that day. It concluded that 'wearing green is a Han, not a minority.' \\nThe report aroused strong dissatisfaction among the young men who were present at the time, and Peng xuchu Xu Junior expressed opposition to the organization. On Peng xuchu Xu's opinion, at that time, the Guizhou Provincial Civil Affairs Committee told Peng xuchu Xuchu that the report was only an academic report. At the same time, Guizhou Provincial Civil Affairs Committee found representatives of young people in the system of the Civil Commission at the time, indicating that the report was not a final conclusion, should not be public, nor widely disseminated. The report would be limited to the leadership of the county government, wearing the national component of the young people, and most importantly depended on the self-determination of young people. \\nThis is not true of the development of the facts. Soon after Fei Xiaotong and others returned to Beijing, the report was sent to the provincial level through the National People's Congress National Committee to form a policy. However, Peng xuchu Xu elementary people did not know that until the beginning of the 80s, the second wave of national identification began, the head of the Bijie District Civil Affairs Commission and the young people involved in national identification first heard of this report, which had been sealed for nearly 30 years. \\nOver the past 30 years, although the young people still retain the treatment of ethnic minorities, their treatment is weakening, from the period of land reform, to special care for ethnic minorities, until the early 1980s, only academic extra points remain. In terms of ethnicity, the original use of more self-proclaimed 'youth' has also gradually changed to 'wear young people' ', known as people are not known as clan, gradually become a provincial tradition. \\nAt the time, Peng xuchu Xu, who opposed the findings of Fei Xiaotong et al., was beaten as right-wing elements in 1957 because they insisted on wearing the youth ethnic composition as an independent minority. The reason was that Peng xuchu Xu elementary people 'wanted to list young people as a minority and set up autonomous counties and wanted to be county governor.' \\nIdentify Yourself\\nThirty years of Hedong, 30 years in Hexi. Nearly 30 years after the first national identification, Zhang Chengkun, who has become the propaganda minister of Zhijin County, suddenly felt that spring was coming. \\nIn 1979 after the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Deng Xiaoping said, 'After democratic reform and socialist transformation, our brotherly peoples have already embarked on the socialist road, forming a new type of socialist nation of solidarity, friendship, mutual assistance and cooperation. Relationships.' At this point, the idea of national work, which was based on class struggles during the Cultural Revolution, was completely reversed, and many ethnic groups for historical reasons were not sufficiently identified or unidentified began to demand the re-establishment of national identification. \\nAs a result, in November of that year, the State Commission on Ethnic Affairs issued document No. 166 \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), 'Notice on the Urgent Implementation of National Identification', which calls for national identification throughout the country. In December of the year, approved by the Guizhou Provincial People's Government, Guizhou province ethnic identification investigation began. \\nAt that time, due to the heavy workload of carrying out the national identification investigation and the shortage of manpower, Miao Chunting, deputy secretary of the Provincial Committee of Guizhou Provincial Committee, gave the opinion: 'To speed up the speed of national identification, it is not realistic to rely on the people appointed by the national people. Similarly, it is unrealistic to rely on provincial people to appoint people everywhere. There are national identification tasks of places, states, cities, counties to organize forces, identify themselves. In doing so, there are two advantages that others cannot replace: one is to contact the actual, and the other is to connect with the masses.' As a result, Guizhou Province has laid down the policy of 'identifying oneself', requiring the governments of the respective nationalities to be identified, to set up an ethnic identification office, and first draw people with their own culture to participate in research and data collection. In addition, according to Miao Chunting's instructions, the focus of this national identification work requires not to be too much entangled on the issue of ethnic origin, and that 'national will' be considered as an objective existence to investigate and research, as an 'extremely important thing'. \\nWang Jiafa was the vice-principal of a middle school in Nayong County. After the province's national identification investigation was carried out, he was drawn by the Nayong County Civil Commission into the newly formed National Identification Office. He also entered the county office at the same time as Huang Liming and Guo Guisen. Huang Liming is a government staff member. Guo Guisen is from the township The director of the enterprise, the office is then the director of the Nayong County Civil Commission Guo Zhenyong. In addition to the three Nayong Wang Jiafa, the young people gathered more weaving gold, with Zhang Chengkun, Li Fachun and others involved. The representatives of Dafang County are Liu Fada, Zhang Ruilin and others. \\nThe work of the entire county national identification organization was basically completed by 1982. The national identification teams of the counties were merged according to ethnicity and were stationed separately by region. For example, the Youth Organization in the organization of gold, the Lilimin group in Anshun, the Longjia group is generous, etc., each group is working separately. At that time, the team leader of the Guanqing identification group was Zhang Chengkun and deputy leader Wang Jiafa. \\nAccording to Wang Jiafa recalled, the main studio visited various places and collected materials. In 1982, Long Mingyao, director of the National Identification Office of the Provincial Civil Commission, led several working groups to visit Hubei, Jiangxi and other places, comparing genealogy, and organized a seminar on scholars and experts in Hubei, Jiangxi and other places. Zhang Fakun had traveled to Jiangxi with Wang Jiafa, at that time Jinggangshan had floated heavy snow, the two people in the guest house, turned over materials, didn't feel sleepy. \\nWhen he went to Jiangxi, Zhang Fakun and others brought the family genealogy of the eight big names wearing the green to control. However, after a visit to nine counties in Jiangxi, they found that from the genealogy point of view, none of the surnames can be linked to the same number, even the ancestral addresses have different times. \\nIn addition, they examined more than 20 local histories in the five counties mentioned above. They still fill the records of Guizhou in order to find Jiangxi immigrants. At the same time, in terms of language and folklore beliefs, the Jiangxi dialects are very different from Xu Zhenjun, which is widely respected in Jiangxi, is also different from the five discernible gods who wear the beliefs of the young people, even the river Most of the West will be the Five Gods are for the evil gods. \\nAfter the investigation in Jiangxi, on the basis of the separate work of each group, the group wrote a preliminary discussion draft of self-identification materials for young people wearing youth. In March 1983, the discussion paper was reported publicly at the Second Ethnic Identification Report in the Western Area of Bijie. On this basis, the National Identification Office of the Provincial Civil Affairs Committee decided to concentrate the groups on Anshun, to further complement the investigation and prepare the colloquium. \\nSo, in April 1983, all groups of people gathered to Anshun Sequoia Hotel, and began nearly a year of merger office. \\nDuring this year, personnel change, Huang Liming, Guo Guisen and others left, and Wang Xinggui, Guo Taihua and other people added into the pianqing identification group. It is worth mentioning that Wang Xinggui was not wearing young people but Buyei. At that time, as head of the government office, he found that some characteristics of wearing young people were very similar to the Buyei ethnic group. He had suggested wearing young people to identify with the Buyei, but was rejected by other colleagues in the youth group. Seeking to be a single nation was the desire to wear young people at that time. \\nAfter Anshun concentrated, information and visits continued. In view of the fact that the first national identification in the 50s had the problem of 'heavy genealogy, light history', this sort of data, wear youth group staff, decided to study a lot of history and find ethnic origin. In response to this, Zhang Fakun recalled that at that time, wearing the youth group had verified about twenty kinds of state and local history within and outside the province and abroad, and also made hard work in the identification of the version. For example, 'Pingyuan Zhi', there are three versions, divided into Qianlong Ben, Daoguben and Guangyumoto. At that time, the three versions were studied in detail; 'Dading Fuzhi' was formed in the Qing Dynasty and 'Dading County Zhi' was written in the Republic of China, compared to the two. In addition to Shi Zhi, the staff of the Youth Group also started research on the genealogy. Long Mingyao continues to lead personnel to Hubei, Hunan, Yunnan and other places to investigate. During the investigation to Dali, Yunnan, Wang Jiafa and Guo Taihua found that the genealogy ancestors had been official in Jinchang Road (now Dali Heqing, Yunnan), and were all attached. \\nLater, a man in the youth group and then combed the young genealogy to book time, and found that the earliest genealogy was now in Qianlong years. After searching for history books, Zhang Chengkun and others found that during the Qianlong period, once the policy was changed, ethnic minorities began to be banned from taking scientific examinations. So, in order to obtain the exams, the young people began to codify their genealogy and attach their identities to Jiangxi immigrants. People also horizontally compared the Qiandongnan Buyei family genealogy, and found that most are also Jiangxi origin, while Guizhou Miao has a few genealogy, but the legend of the stream still attached to Jiangxi immigrants. As a result, they concluded that most of the family genealogy of the ethnic minorities in Guizhou had been deliberately altered and did not have sufficient credit. \\nSuch a conclusion clearly contradicts those made by Fei Xiaotong for the first time. Not only that, after many visits, wear youth groups, etc., also made three conclusions:\\n1, wear the young people believe in the five obvious gods, worship the five altar, and the first recorded in Guizhou in southeast Guizhou, so, the belief of the five apparent gods wearing young people should come from southeast Guizhou. \\n2, wearing young people moved from Jiangxi to say, it is untenable, if in the beginning of the Ming because of the North and South, moved from Jiangxi, then this contradicts the historical facts of Guizhou Patrol in the Ming Wan calendar year that the Guizhou went through the Blue as Miao Man. According to the examination of the youth group, before the Ming Dynasty, there were native people living in the Wuxi area on the border of Xiangqian, but the native people in southwest Xiangxi and northwest Guizhou were relatively early, and the young people should be the earlier locals in China. \\n3, wear the language of young people, called 'old life words' or 'boss cavity', and the Southeast Guizhou dialect, from the pronunciation, tone is exactly the same. And in Qianxi, there is no nation that accents this. Therefore, wearing young people is not a branch of the Qianxi Yi, Miao and other ethnic minorities. \\nThe successive conclusions reached have gone beyond the framework of the first national identification report, and differences have arisen during the identification process. Should they count as Guizhou indigenous minorities, or Han immigrants who moved from Jiangxi? Wang Dianhua, then director of the Zhijin County Civil Commission, contacted all parties with their views. The parties finally decided that according to the actual investigation, the young people were a single ethnic minority. \\nUnfinished Ethnic Identification\\nIn the preparation of this report, which will identify the young people as a single minority, Fei Xiaotong, the leader of the national identification in Guizhou for the first time, came to Guizhou for a special visit to Guizhou to listen to the second national identification work in Guizhou. The staff of the Youth Group were asked to collate the current identification investigation into materials and report to Fei Xiaotong. \\nThe writing of the reporting material fell to Zhang Chengkuntou. In June 1983, he hastily stopped his work at hand and began writing a report on the identification and investigation of the national composition of the young people in Guizhou Province, which was prepared to report to Fei Xiaotong. On 29 June, the report was finalized and reproduced on 1 July after discussion and slightly modified by staff members of the Youth Group Wang Xinggui, Zhao Lin, Zhang Ruilin, Chen Xuexiang and others. Later, the report served as the basis for the preparation of the reinvestigation report by the Youth Group. \\nOn July 8, Zhang Chengkunte rushed from Anshun to Guiyang, in the meeting room of the new building of the CPPCC in Guiyang province. This material was reported to Fei Xiaotong and the provincial leadership of the United Front Department and the Provincial Civil Affairs Committee. Based on the work done over a year, the report states that young people should be a single minority. \\nAfter hearing the report, the next day, Fei Xiaotong made a 'Report on Ethnic Identification'. According to Zhang Chengkun's recollection, the main thrust of Fei Xiaotong's speech was to persuade everyone, although it was a minority in history, but now do not fight again. 'By comparing himself, he said he could not figure out what ethnic group it was, probably the descendants of the warriors who had been hitting the Japanese in history. He was full of hair, and Fei Xiaotong said his chest also had hair. Zhang Chengkun said, 'But Fei Xiaotong said, he does not ask for minority treatment now, so we are advised to give up the request.' \\nFei Xiaotong's remarks made the young people who listened to the report at the time were particularly unhappy. Soon after, Shi Lianzhouin, professor of the Central University for Nationalities, wrote the book 'National Identification of China', went to Guizhou to investigate and encounter young people wearing them to protest Fei Xiaotong. He recalled that at that time, the young people wearing Fei Xiaotong were strongly dissatisfied with Fei Xiaotong, and even proposed that 'the father is not dead, Lu can't die'. \\nOn July 13, 1983, Fei Xiaotong returned to Beijing with two revised 'Identification and Investigation Report on the Ethnic Composition of the Youth in Guizhou Province'. Almost six months later, in January 1984, the Guizhou Provincial National Identification Office decided to wear the youth organization by Jin, Nayong County personnel, and the division of labor to write the 'Reinvestigation report on ethnic composition of the youth in Guizhou Province'. In September of that year, in response to the report, the Civil Commission organized a colloquium in Guiyang. After the meeting, the staff of the two counties wear youth group continued to modify, and they were ready to be reported to the State Civil Commission by the Provincial Civil Affairs Committee. \\nIn March 1985, then director of the Civil Commission of Guizhou Province Xiong Tiangui and director of the Institute of Civil Studies and the deputy director of the National Identification Office Long Mingyao went to Beijing, with 8 kilograms weighing national identification material, went to the State Civil Commission to report. However, according to those who returned from the meeting, the reporting process had not been smooth, particularly with regard to the issue of wearing young people, who had repeatedly been prevented from speaking. \\nThat's why things went straight. After reporting by Xiong Tiangui and others by the State Civil Commission, the State Civil Affairs Commission came out to ask to stop continuing to identify and conclude that 'wearing young people are Han people, not ethnic minorities.' At that time, the National Civil Council gave the reasoning that, in the 1950s, the ethnic problems of our country had been largely resolved. The work to change the composition of the nation has been basically completed. \\nSo, after Xiong Tiangui returned from Beijing, he personally found representatives of young people wearing them, Zhijin Zhang Chengkun, Nayong Wang Jiafa, Nayong Wang Jiafa and generous Liu Fada, and so on to convey the spirit of the State Civil Commission, and convince the three people to stop the national identification work. Then, Huang Guangyuan, deputy director of the State Civil Commission, came to Guizhou to convey the spirit of the State Civil Commission. At this time, the report of the State Civil Affairs Commission on the issue of wearing young people has also been sent to Guizhou. The conclusions of the report repeat the conclusions of the 50s and concluded that 'wearing young people are Chinese, not a single minority'. \\nThree years of work was once overthrown and the internal views of young people were ignored. In rural areas, rural areas began to organize parades spontaneously. There are also groups of young people who are ready to go to Beijing in tandem for petitions. For a time, social stability has arisen as a result of ethnic problems. \\nOn 1 February 1986, the Ministry of Public Security and the State Civil Affairs Commission jointly issued a Notice on the Use of Ethnic Text and Ethnic Elements for Resident Identity Cards, which stipulates that the national item of the national identity card should be filled in full name according to the national name identified by the State. In particular, it is stated that the 'Han' should still be filled out as 'Han' if they have opinions on the identified Han people (such as young people). Such regulations provoke stronger dissatisfaction among the local youth in Guizhou. \\nIn view of this, on April 24, 1986, Hu Jintao, then secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Committee, held an office meeting for the people to be identified in Guizhou province, dedicated to listening to the report of the Civil Commission of Guizhou province. After the meeting, the 'Minutes of the Office Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the CPC' \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), were formed, in which it was clearly decided that the status quo should be maintained before the issue of the ethnic composition of the eight groups such as Kuanqing and Cai Jia 'has not been explicitly resolved, that is, any person who has been treated according to ethnic minorities is still treated according to ethnic minorities. How to fill in the original national ingredients still how to fill in. At the same time, Guizhou Province decided not to communicate or issue the notices issued by the Ministry of Public Security and the State Civil Commission. \\nIn May of this year, in order to implement the decision taken in Guizhou Province in 86 years, during the first generation of resident identity cards issued in that year, the Guizhou Provincial Public Security Department and the Guizhou Provincial Civil Affairs Commission issued several provisions on the national composition of the population identity cards, which specifically emphasized that 'the country has not yet been positive The formula identified as a national minority, which has not been declared as Han after liberation, its national composition How to fill in the past, now how to fill in. Such as 'wear green' should be filled in as 'wear youth'.' In dealing with the issue of ethnic identification, Guizhou Province has embarked on a different path. \\nHowever, national identification is now over. On May 1, 1986, the party group of the State Democratic Committee reported to Xi Zhongxun and the Central Secretariat that 'the task of national identification in our country was basically completed in the 50s, and the problem of changing the composition of the nation has been basically resolved.' Among them, principles for dealing with the pending national identification issues are proposed, such as 'in the case of similar ethnic groups... to be integrated with each other as possible and identified as the same people'. At this point, the efforts of young people to seek a single minority have failed. Information such as the 'Report on the Re-investigation of the Ethnic Composition of the Young People in Guizhou Province' is used only as an archive of historical materials and has been thrown to the cabinet. \\nThe averse path of identity\\nAfter the end of the national identification work, Wang Jiafa did not return to school, but left with the government department and was responsible for writing 'Nayong County Zhi'. County Zhifu Cheng, he retired, and Zhang Chengkun and Wang Dianhua, who participated with him in national identification that year, have also retired home, and the vigorous national identification of the young people became silent. Nationalities whose identity remains to be determined continue to wander between Han and ethnic minorities. \\nThis ambiguous silence was broken in 2003. In May of that year, on the eve of the issuance of the second generation of identity cards, the Ministry of Public Security proposed that the ethnic composition of the young people should be filled in as 'Han', and that at the beginning there was no national code to wear young people in the identity system. Such a vision sparked strong dissatisfaction among the young people. Private groups of young people spontaneously appealed to the Provincial Civil Affairs Committee, believing that the practice of the Ministry of Public Security involved 'forced assimilation', while representatives of the young people through the Zhijin County Civil Commission also expressed dissatisfaction to the Guizhou Provincial Civil Commission, and a larger appeal was also being brewing. Knowing the matter, the Civil Commission of Guizhou Province quickly joined the Guizhou Provi"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "ncial Public Security Department to reflect the problem to the State Civil Commission and reach the State Council. \\nEventually, according to 86 years of practice, things remain the same family name. Therefore, on August 28 of that year, the Ministry of Public Security issued document No. 118 to Guizhou Province, 'On the Approval of the Issues on Fill in the Contents of the National Identity Card Project of the National Project of the National Identity Card for the National Project of the National People of the National People in Guizhou Province', which states that 'in order to safeguard the overall situation of national unity and social stability, 'Whosoever has been treated according to a national minority, what is the original when filling out the national component 'How to fill in' principle, when processing resident ID cards, adopt a transitional approach, which can be filled in as 'leather family' and 'wear youth'. \\nDespite this, wearing young people out of the province still face identity embarrassment. The children of Li Fachun, who wear young people, were admitted to a school in Chongqing. After they went to school, the school did not recognize the national identity of the young people in 56 nationalities and asked the children to change their ethnic name. The Li Fachun family did not want to change it, then came up with a notice from the Ministry of Public Security and the school against the book This is not an individual case. According to Zhang Chengkun, the choice of national identity is indeed a difficult problem when the young children apply for the examination. Some fill up the Han people, and it is difficult to recover from this time. In addition, before the second-generation identity card popularization, young people wearing young people go out to work, and need to process temporary identity cards and also need to be declared as Han. The loss of the identity of young people, as well as the number of young people who wears young people who have disappeared inexplicably in the population statistics of the public security department in recent years, have made the young and elderly people feel more anxious. \\nIn 2007, another related to the major event of wearing the national identity of the young people. Once again, Zhang Chengkun, Wang Jiafa, Wang Dianhua and others went out to the mountain again. Many of them even signed signatures, protesting. \\nOn October 9, 2007, the Bureau of Ethnic Affairs of Bijie District of Guizhou Province issued a notice to each county and municipal Bureau of National Affairs on conducting the work of population verification and unidentified national identity investigation in our region, requiring three unidentified nationalities headed by 'wear young people', if they need to identify one other Ethnic groups need to report to the Regional Bureau of Nationalities as soon as possible in order to report to the Land Committee and the Administration \\nAfter the notice was issued, Zhijin, Nayong, Qingzhen and generous places organized a symposium between the representatives of Yuanqing. Among them, Nayong held a symposium on October 17, after discussion, tend to identify to the Tujia family; Zhijin on October 17 and 24, respectively, held two symposiums, and also unified views, from ethnic origin, customs, language, and hope to identify to the Tujia; Qingzhen also said to identify with the Turkish family; only great Fang decided to identify with the Yi ethnic group. \\nHistorically, unidentified peoples, such as choosing the path of national identity, were generally keen to choose peoples that did not exist in the province or region. Such an approach, in terms of political treatment, is the best option. \\nAt this time, the young people have no hope of becoming a single minority, and more youth representatives began to pursue the path of national identity. Nayong two counties, accounting for nearly 80% of the weaving gold, Nayong two counties wear the green people, according to the examination study, from four aspects that wear young people and Tujia are the same: 1, ancient ethnic names are the same, since the Ming Dynasty of Guizhou local books called 'native people'; 2, before the Qing Dynasty dress is very similar, are large sleeves of rolling lace in Tsing Yi; 3, religious beliefs are similar, Tujia sacrifice five rampant, wear young people sacrifice, The two exonyms, and the ritual show is very similar; 4, the remaining language traces of reality are the same, sound changes are f change h, ian change ie, such as 'house' as 'yellow', 'salt' read as 'Yaba' and so on. \\nWhat's more worth mentioning is that, according to Wang Dianhua, the author of the study study of the problems of young people, Yang Ran, a doctor from the Central University for Nationalities, went on to weave gold, Wang Dianhua talked with his family genealogy. It was found that Yang Ran's genealogy from Chongqing's Tujia family was actually able to associate himself with the young family genealogy of the Yang family. The origin of the young people and the Turkish family is visible. \\nHowever, the views of the two counties of Zhijin and Nayong reached Bijie area, but were left on hold and were not communicated upwards. At the same time, Bijie Administration sent a deputy commissioner to Zhijin and Nayong two counties to guide the people to unify their views, learn Dafang County, identify with the Yi people. According to Zhang Chengkun, Wang Jiafa, Wang Dianhua and others, this is because the Bijie area has the largest number of Yi ethnic groups, while local government leaders are also mostly Yi. In response, Chen Hongshu, the former director of the Zhijin County People's Congress, told 'Phoenix Weekly' reporter that the Bijie Land Committee had had a deputy secretary of the Yi ethnic group to do his job, hoping to guide the young people to identify the Yi community, but did not do it all. \\nThe delegates are not satisfied with this proposal. They believe that the young people are coming from the east side, and the Yi are coming from the west. In the western area of the water, they have lived together for hundreds of years, different from each other. They have never been integrated together and should not be classified as a family. In response to the opinions of young people wearing, Bijie area specially organized scholars to write relevant materials, from a historical point of view, wear young people or belong to the 'Qingyi'. According to Chen Hongshu, he hoped to wear young people to identify with the Yi people, it was not the idea of the morning and evening. As early as the first national identification, there were officials in Bijie area who argued that wearing young people should identify to the Yi ethnic group. Only at that time Fei Xiaotong was defined as a Han ethnic composition, and this was done. \\nIn order to resist the bijie area's 'stay in the middle' of the reported materials and the recognition of the ethnic belonging of the young people at the academic level, the representative of Chuanqing visited the Provincial Civil Affairs Committee. However, the reply given by the deputy director of the Yi nationality of the Provincial People's Committee was the same as the Bijie area: the internal views of the young people were not uniform. On the question of wearing young people, Phoenix Weekly reporter had called the Civil Affairs and Law Department of Guizhou Provincial Civil Affairs Committee. The answer was: the question was more sensitive. \\nThe people who wear young people did not stop, came out by a then-provincial people's Congress officer, contacted the Tujia Society of Guizhou Province, and held a special private forum. Chen Guoan, vice president of Tujia Society of Guizhou Province, later told 'Phoenix Weekly' reporter that the attitude of the Tujia Society at that time was welcome to wear young people to identify with the Tujia family, but wanted to wear the youth attention policy grasp. Chen Guoan followed the leadership of the Provincial Civil Affairs Committee in the 80s to examine the issue of wearing young people. In his view, wearing the identity of young people was really embarrassed. The ethnic group did not identify with Han, the surrounding minority did not identify her, and the local Han people did not agree with her. This time, the national identity also touches on the proportion of the Yi, Hui and Miao population in Bijie area. Therefore, policy is very strong and difficult. \\nDespite the difficulties as Chen Guoan said, the positive reaction of the Turkmen Society has given the impetus to wear young people. Since then, young people from around the world met separately to study the issue of identity to the Turkish family. On March 28, 2008, Nayong Youth representatives formed the Nayong County Youth National Identity Organizing Committee and held a national identity conference on behalf of the Organizing Committee to discuss the issue of identity with the Tujia family. On the day of the meeting, Wang Jiafa's father was seriously ill in the village. The meeting was important and could not be taken into account. But did not expect that when the meeting was near the end of the meeting, he received a phone call and the country father had just died. The father died, the old man who traveled for a half-life of his national identity, drank his life regret. \\nThe astray path of identity, road resistance and long. Under the suspicion of identity, the ethnic customs of wearing young people have also disappeared a little bit in China and urbanization. At present, in addition to the few remote areas of Qianxi still keep wearing traditional clothing, tiara and earthos, the young people in more places already look similar to the Han, but the internal national will is like stone-like time and never lost. \\nWhere should an unidentified nation go? In 2006, Yang Ran wrote at the end of his doctoral thesis, 'The study of young people wearing youth' wrote: 'In the center of the youth, the general reflection is that the name 'wear you' is passed down by the ancestral generations and cannot change the name on themselves, as to the care of the state is irrelevant. Moreover, in today's historical environment of diversity and well-developed information, how to solve the problems of ethnic groups such as youth, eliminate negative and resistance among them, and build a harmonious society should be confronted. We believe that the best way is not to prevent blocking, not to evade, but to strengthen consultations and actively channel.' \\nHistory of writing and book\\nEthnic identification in the 50s came to an end in 1956, following the end of ethnic identification, followed by the ethnographic survey. The survey covered the history, culture, social form and language of various ethnic minorities. Among them, the Minority Language Survey, which introduced Soviet experience, established in 1956, the Institute for Minority Languages was established with the Director of Baulhan. The ethnic social history survey was led by Peng xuchu Zhen. Both are carried out separately. \\nThe importance attached to the languages of minorities was already stated in the Common Programme for the Establishment of the Nation, but at that time, there were still many ethnic minorities in China who had only languages and no words. Since 1951, the CCP proposed to 'help people who do not yet have words to create texts and help people with incomplete texts gradually improve. text' and gradually incorporate the proposal into the political platform, written in 1956 Second five-year plan for the development of the national economy. \\nIn this context, after 1954, professors from the USSR Academy of Education Sciences Gerl Sergiuchenko were invited to China to teach Chinese scholars experience in the creation of minority languages. A year later, Beijing held its first scientific symposium on national languages to study the issue of writing writing. Later, Ma Xueliang, who participated in the national language survey, recalled that in 1955, Hu Qiaomu was commissioned by Mao Zedong to summon a national language expert in Zhongnanhai to inquire about the reserve of ethnic language talents. After hearing reports from Ma Xueliang and others, Hu Qiaomu indicated that, except for some teachers staying in school, senior students and fresh graduates can participate in the survey. \\nAs a result, in February 1956, the Central Institute for Nationalities held a training course for more than 400 people in language investigation, bringing together graduates of the National Institute for Nationalities and cadres of national minorities with a higher level of culture throughout the country. After three months, the teachers and students were divided into seven investigation teams according to their professional direction. Investigations. \\nIn this survey, a total of 42 ethnic groups have been studied in more than 50 languages. Eleven ethnic minorities, including Zhuang, Buyei, Li, Dong, Miao, Yi, etc., with languages, have improved and reformed Lahu, Jingpo, Mongolian, Uyghur and Ha A variety of words such as Sark. \\nIn parallel with the ethnic language survey, the ethnic minority history survey led by Peng xuchu Zhen was conducted. In 1956, Peng xuchu Zhen, in accordance with Mao Zedong's directive, instructed the NPC to carry out an investigation into the social history of ethnic minorities, asking for an in-depth examination of the social morphology and historical development of various ethnic minorities in the country and preparing for socialist transformation. \\nSo, in 1956, the NPC sent more than 200 people from the central government to participate in the investigation, and set up eight investigation teams including Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Guangxi and Guangdong. In 1958, the investigation team increased from 8 to 16, adding eight investigation teams, including Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Hunan, Fujian, Weng Dujian, Fu Lehuan, Lin Yaohua, Chen Yongling, Shen Jiaju, Shi Lianzhu, Wang Bingyu, Wang Juibao and other scholars, respectively, participated in the relevant team. The number of personnel increased to a thousand, of which the Central Institute for Nationalities alone drew more than 400 people, almost the whole class Transported outward, now retired Professor Shao Xianshu of the Central University for Nationalities was one of those who participated in the survey as a student at that year. \\nThe main work at that time was, on the one hand, to divide the social patterns of ethnic minorities on the basis of Marxist principles. At that time, the whole country is already on the verge of the 'Great Leap Forward' period. Under the idea of dividing the social form for social transformation, slogans such as 'step across the millennium' and 'running into socialism' began to appear, and controversy over the division of ethnic minority social patterns. In this regard, Hou Yuangao, deputy director of the Western Development Research Center of the Central University for Nationalities, took the Yi as an example, to say that it was a slave society or feudal society. The academic community had cried for twenty years, until the 1980s, after the country's political system was changed, the wind began to flourish. \\nOn the other hand, the work is to collate the historical documents of ethnic minorities and respond to Mao Zedong's call to help each identified minority to prepare a brief history and brief history of the ethnic group. At that time, Shi Lianzhu, who was the leader of the Zhejiang and Fujian team, had two main tasks: one was to investigate the Shes and the other was to investigate the Gaoshan ethnic group, and to write a brief history and brief summary of the ethnic group based on the findings and historical materials. According to him, there was no experience in writing ethnohistories at that time, and everyone's job was to touch the stone across the river. \\nThe survey work ended in 1964. According to incomplete statistics, more than 340 kinds of survey materials were written before and after the social history survey of ethnic minorities, more than 29 million words, collated archives and excerpts of more than 100 kinds, over 15 million words, and filmed documentary films for ethnic minorities, and collected a group of minority histories Relics. As a result of the survey, a brief history of each ethnic group has been published since 1964. However, the brief history and the brief book only refer to the establishment of the Republic, and the matter after the establishment of the State has not been dealt with properly. \\nLater, due to the impact of the Cultural Revolution, the finalization of the social history survey of ethnic minorities was stopped until after the Cultural Revolution, the preparation of the remaining historical materials was gradually completed. In 1980, Shi Lianzhu's editor-in-chief's 'Brief History of Shes' was published, although only 80,000 words, but prior to publication had to be reviewed verbatim by shes representatives, which made him remember to this day, it is still unforgettable. \\nEnd of 56 ethnic groups\\nThe holding of the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1978 brought the mainland into a new page of political history, so the national identification work was revisited. \\nIn order to repair the inter-ethnic relations damaged during the Cultural Revolution, the Sixth Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China adopted a resolution on certain historical issues since the founding of the State, specifically mentions the significance of 'improving and developing socialist national relations and strengthening national unity'. Under the new situation, how to deal with ethnic relations and balance the rights of various ethnic minorities in electing people's representatives, implementing ethnic regional autonomy, training national cadres, enlistment, recruitment, recruitment, recruitment, recruitment and participation in the armed forces, as well as family planning and economic support, is the focus of the work of the nation in the new period of the Communist Party. \\nTo solve the above problems, the first thing to start is to deal with the problems left over from the national identification work of the 50s. Therefore, at that time, the State Civil Affairs Commission conducted key investigations in the six provinces and autonomous regions with more controversial disputes, held seminars on national identification work in Guizhou, Hebei, Hunan and other provinces. On November 3, 1979, it sent the 'On Urgent National Identification' to Sichuan, Tibet, Guizhou, Guangdong and other provinces and autonomous regions Job Notice, which calls for identification surveys of ethnic minorities that have yet to be identified. \\nAccording to data from the Third National Population Census in 1982, over this period, the national population called for the restoration and change of ethnic composition amounted to 5 million. In such a situation, a further large-scale national identification survey would have had too much impact and would break the existing ethnic pattern, so the approach of work at that time tended to change the composition of the nation. Identifying an existing nation has become part of the issue of national identification work during this period. \\nThus, with the exception of the Keno people surveyed in the 50s, which were newly identified as a single minority in 1979, there were no new nationalities between 1978 and 1990 for more than a decade. But the process of integration involving millions of clans is in full swing. Among them, Guizhou Province has relaunched the ethnic identification survey since 1982, and the 23 ethnic minorities left behind in the 1950s, including 'wear young people', etc., have been integrated; 'Wawxiang people', 'locals', 'Wuzhou yao' and so on were classified as Han in Guangxi; Guangxi put 100,000 ethnic groups to be identified Mouth were merged to Zhuang, Yao, Miao, Yi and other 10 ethnic minorities; Yunnan's 'bitter Cong people' into Lahu and 'Mosuo' are classified into the Nasi, while the 'Tuva' in Xinjiang are still considered to be a Mongolian group. \\nThe integration of nationalities has maintained the existing ethnic pattern and averted national-political conflicts arising out of the newly established nation, but this initiative has created new problems unexpectedly. \\nThe problem still lies with the Turkish family. Entering the 80s, after the change of ethnic composition began, many formerly classified as Han and Miao people have changed to Tujia, the largest of which is the 1.4 million people in West to the Tujia move. By, the Turkish family population from more than 500,000 in 1957, soared all the way, to the fifth census in 2000, it already has a population of 8.02 million, the total population is listed in Zhuang, Full, Back, Miao and Wei, and ranks sixth in the country. \\nThe expansion of the population, on the one hand, brings the dispersion of national identity. In the 80s, when the Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture was established, Bai Zhensheng, professor of the Central University for Nationalities, led students in Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture internship. At that time, when the Turkish family cadres in Xiangxi spoke with Bai Zhengsheng about the changes in the West, the gods were quite uncomfortable, believing that the Otxi Tujia were not real Tujia, and that the merger was only a government act. \\nOn the other hand, the increase in the population has also raised the political status of the Turkish family. In addition to the increase in ethnic representation, the status of administrative divisions has also been promoted upward. The earliest xiangxi region for the Miao Autonomous Prefecture, and then the number of Tujia people over the Miao, changed the name to Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. In the 80s, the Turkish family was not satisfied with the treatment of the autonomous prefectures after the rapid expansion of the Turkish family population, and once hoped to be able to string up the Tujia clan in Xiang, E, Qianqian and Chongqing regions, and became an autonomous region. \\nSuch a change was unanticipated from the center. Ethnic integration efforts, which would have hoped not to break the existing ethnic situation, would have even greater impact if there were changes in provincial administrative divisions. At that time, the turmoil of the international situation, the upheaval in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and the collapse of the Soviet Union left the rest of the socialist countries chilling and national-political issues became hot potato, with any impact seen as a potential for a greater crisis. In view of this, even though the Tibetan people and other nationalities are still waiting to identify, the central leaders of the central central government have decided to stop the national identification work completely for the sake of stability of the country and society. \\nAs a result, in November 1989, the State Civil Council and the Ministry of Public Security issued a Notice on the Suspension of Work to Change the National Constituency. In May 1990, the State Civil Affairs Commission, the State Council Leading Group for the Fourth Population Census and the Ministry of Public Security jointly issued the 'Provisions on the Determination of Ethnic Components by Chinese Citizens'. Subsequently, according to the results of the fourth population census in 1990, China officially confirmed the inclusion of 56 nationalities, 55 of which are ethnic minorities and minorities The total population of ethnic groups is over 91.2 million, accounting for 8.04 per cent of the country's total population. \\nThe opportunity to be officially recognized as a single nation is lost for controversial unresolved nationalities, including undetermined 'nations to be identified' and 'identified nations' whose ethnic affiliation is not recognized by themselves but not recognized by them. Scholars familiar with the State Civil Commission at that time conveyed the events of the year to the reporter of the Phoenix Weekly, saying that at that time the government's attitude was that national academics could continue to study, but policy was about stability, maintaining 56 nationalities, and would no longer allow breakthroughs. \\nSummarization and thought\\nNational recognition, which began 62 years ago, delayed for more than 40 years, has become the yellow flower of tomorrow and is rarely known in mainland China. And in the singing of '56 flowers of 56 nationalities', most of the experts and scholars who participated in this work in that year have passed away. There are few surviving people, who can speak even harder. This scenario, makes Shi Lian Zhu heart quite sad. \\nIn his view, when the new China began, national identification played a key role in the country's stability. At that time, the state did devote itself to the work, but such an important work was not summed up after a sudden end in 1990. \\nOf course, not nobody summarizes. In 1993, Shi Lian Zhu himself wrote a monograph entitled 'National Identification of China', published in 1995 with the support of the State Civil Commission, and won the first prize for outstanding results in policy research by the State Civil Council. \\nIn 2010, Thomas S.Mullaney, PhD in History, Columbia University also published a monograph titled 'Coming to with the Nation Terms: Ethnic Terms Classification in Modern China', led by Yew Wah Lam of the southwest ethnic recognition as an incision, to discuss the Chinese national identification work in the 50s. In this book, Thomas S.Mullaney commented: 'In 1995, China's first (and so far only), analytical monograph on ethnic classification was published by Shi Lianzhu. For the first time in this report, some of the most basic questions on this subject are conclusive answers.' At the same time, after visiting five members of Yunnan Province who participated in ethnic identification in Yunnan Province in 1954, Shi Lianzhu, Xu Ning, Zhou Yuewen, Yan Ruxian and Wang Xiaoyi, he was surprised to find a foreign researcher interested in an almost forgotten topic in China. Forgotten topics, worth thinking. \\nIn addition, Fei Xiaotong, Lin Yaohua and others have also written articles to summarize China's national identification work with first-hand experience. While affirming the achievements of national recognition, Fei and Lin also pointed out that there are still many remaining problems in national identification work that need to be resolved. \\nAs Lin Yaohua mentioned in the article 'Ethnic Identification of Southwest China', China still has very few ethnic units, and the identification work is yet to be carried out, such as those in southern Tibet and the Kemu people in southern Xishuangbanna. In his book 'National Identification of China', Shi Lianzhu extended the range of ethnic groups to include Hainan Province Miao, Hainan Lingao, Xinjiang Tuis, Sherpa Tibetan, Xizang Shalpa, and Unidentified ethnic groups such as Taiwanese, and other unidentified nationalities such as the Chuan Long Junction and the Taiwanese Alpine. Solve the problem. \\nSo far, according to statistics, China still has more than 700,000 ethnic groups to be identified, the vast majority of which are distributed in Guizhou, such as the population of about 670,000 young people and gadowan people. Although they are classified as Han and other nationalities, the will to become a single nation is strong and is not satisfied with the result of ethnic integration. After the discontinuation of ethnic identification in 1990, the issue of attribution of these nationalities was treated as a sensitive issue in Guizhou Province. \\nMoreover, the misrepresentation of ethnic groups still needs to be corrected. For example, Yunnan Pumi, in the opinion of scholars, actually belong to Tibetans, and the same group is classified as Tibetan in the Sichuan part, which has caused the situation of two parts of the family. The same is true of the Zhuang and Bouyei. The two communities have the same language, history and culture are not very different, but in Guizhou are all Buyei ethnic groups, in Guangxi, and a nation is divided by provincial administrative divisions. In addition, the Yi, Lisu, Hani, Lahu and other ethnic groups should be one nation, but in the process of national identification, they were classified as seven or eight nationalities. \\nSome of the nationalities that have been successfully identified have also revealed a number of legacy problems in the development process. If Zhejiang Jingning Shes moved from Wuping County, Fujian Province, but Jingning is classified as She Autonomous County, Wuping is not identified as a shes populated area. Problems such as these have not been resolved due to the cessation of national identification work. \\nNowadays, Shi Lianzhu and others have gone through years, and their cry on the above issues has long been exhausted. Looking back, past things like spring and autumn. 'At that time, we were young, doing national work, and had a full feeling for minorities, which even permeated our lives. Unlike nowadays, there is no feeling among nations, and on ethnic issues, the country is not as 'style' as before.' \\n(Phoenix Weekly Issue No. 9, 2012, No. 430, entitled 'How the 56 Nationalities Come')\\nPhoenix Zhou Kan Zhao Jiapeng http://blog.ifeng.com/article/17152394.html\\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attachment 2】Li Yuzhi: 'Listen to me about the story of the young people in the past' (network)\\nFirst talk about the 50s wearing young people identification. \\nIn 1955 AD, by the National People's Congress, Dean Fei Xiaotong, Professor Wang Jingru and the State Committee for Ethnic Affairs Song Shuhua and others came to Guizhou with the National Committee for Ethnic Affairs of Guizhou Province, the Guizhou Provincial Institute for Nationalities and the ethnic affairs of the regions and counties with national identification missions Task forces were drawn up jointly by the Commission and provincial teams to be sent to Bijie district Internally called 'Guizhou Provincial Ethnic Identification Task Force', externally called 'Guizhou Mountain Production Transformation Task Force'. Fei Xiaotong is the captain, Li Fangyao and Wang Jingru are deputy captains. The scope of the investigation is mainly Bijie and Anshun. In Bijie is divided into four groups of Dading, Nayong, Zhijin, Shuicheng. Bijie area set up a working group sent to Zhijin County to be called the 'Ethnic Identification Working Group' to the outside world, called the 'Mountain Production Visit Group', and Song Shuhua was the leader, while in Nayong called the 'Mountain Production Survey Group' and in Dading called the 'Mountain Production Reconstruction Task Force' in Dading. The main subjects of the investigation were Chuanqing, followed by the people's community such as Longjia, Cai Jia, Luren and Nanjing. The survey lasted more than four months from a meeting in April to a provincial summary in early August. The survey was led by Professor Fei Xiaotong. Its conclusion was that the Chinese and not ethnic minorities had formed a 'Survey Report on the Ethnic Composition of the Young People in Guizhou Province', but the relevant part of the country was guided by this conclusion when formulating and implementing policies. \\nIn Zhi Jin, Mr. Peng xuchu Xuchu, who was deputy director of the Youth Commission, was involved in the whole investigation of the youth wear. After the investigation was completed, Mr. Peng xuchu Lao, who was happy, thought he was designated as 'the young people' wearing a spiked shoe and a stick. Year after year, there is always no finding in the face of the ethnic composition of young people, and there is no news about the visits everywhere. Like the majority of young people wearing young people, Mr. Old has always insisted that his ethnic composition is a young ethnic group, refuses to fill the ethnic composition as Han according to the above meaning. This can be obtained, the old Mr. of the Cultural Revolution was finally 'killing the chicken monkey', and Zhang Ruiyu, a young man with his colleagues, was beaten as 'local nationalist right-wing separatist', and took his high caps and returned home to feed the pigs. Even so, the two gentlemen did not change their position of wearing the national composition of the young people until after the end of the cultural revolution, they were not returned to their posts. \\nIn September 1978, Fei Xiaotong, who was also beaten as the right, just rehabilitated, delivered a speech entitled 'Issues on the identification of our nation' at the meeting of the National Committee of the CPPCC National Committee. Talents wearing young people knew that Fei Xiaotong had quietly engaged in fame and excitement. Then there was an investigation in 1981, but Peng xuchu Lao left. And Zhang Ruiyu's elderly people were fortunate enough to participate in the investigation. It can be described as absurd years absurd, three right-wing plays. Think about the absurd moves of some people nowadays, and how can it be worthy of the old generation who walked for the young people, let alone the fathers. \\nZhang Ruiyu's elderly people lived in Zhijin Inadogi in the central area of the youth. Before liberation, the local government of the Republic of the Republic had set up a national school here, but the conditions were extremely poor, there were no school classrooms, completely rented private housing to run schools, and usually maintained the size of 20-30 students. The National School of Paul was dissolved on the eve of liberation. In February 1952 after liberation, Zhang Ruiyu was commissioned by the local farmers association to pilot the new China education career in Dogi. In the first phase, only 12 children of families with better economic conditions were enrolled. The school premises were still leased to residents through the Agricultural Association, without tables and chairs. Students sat on the ground to study. Teachers used the loosely weathered gravel as chalk, and the Han landlord bear's plaque black as a blackboard. Later, the school received the attention and support of the local people and the support of the county government. In just a year and a half, the number of students soared to more than 200 people, the Doji Primary School was officially established, and its nature was also changed from private to public. Since then, relatively large government funding has been allocated for the construction of school buildings, and the size of the school run has increased year by year. During the Cultural Revolution period, local education was stagnant, school founder Zhang Ruiyu was beaten as right-wing decentralized labor, and the school was also on the verge of dissolution. After the end of the Cultural Revolution, the development of schools is on the right track. \\nIn 1984 and 1986, under the strong recommendation of Zhang Ruiyu elderly people, more than 30 local minority students were sent to the Qiandongnan National Cadre School of Qiandongnan, Kaili City. Zhang Ruiyu's elderly people to wear young people can be described as diligent, hard work! Look at these guys now, I'm blushing. \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"}

In 1952, when the production was fixed, the production of Pingdi paddy fields was too high, coupled with excessive rainfall in 1954, the actual production was reduced, resulting in a gap between the required and actual production.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】Yangtze River Daily: Debunking the True Face of Pengyi Lake (1957.7.6)\\nRecently, some people are calling 'peasant life bitter'. Rightists also grabbed the topic to make an article. Yesterday's landlords are also calling for farmers today. It seems strange to say, but things are true. In Wuhan's Pengyi Lake, it is such a person. \\nIn order to figure out exactly what kind of person Peng yihu is, who he is speaking on behalf of, the reporter recently made a visit and investigation to the hometown of Pengyi Lake, Yueyang Huangtian, Hunan. \\nHere are the peasants from Pengyi Lake's hometown-some of them from former tenants, debtors, employees, and more. \\nLandlords, debtors and bureaucrats eight years ago, Peng Yi Lake was also the landowner of Huangtian. \\nHe once served as a model county governor under Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime. By exploiting people's sweat money, he occupied more than 100 acres of fertile fields in the Huangtian mountain area, becoming one of the three most powerful landlords in the region. \\nLike other landlords, tenants of Pengyi Lake suffer from land rental exploitation is cruel. Poor farmers tented 15, 6 tons of land harvested a year, and pay 10 tons of rent a year. In this way, Pengyi Lake receives several hundred tons of rent in a year. The farmer's hard work throughout the year has only fallen hungry, groaned, and is in danger of seizing tenancy at any time. \\nPengyi Lake is also a big owner of high profits. \\nHe lends money through his wife and daughter-in-law. In addition, five others are the two owners who lent money on Pengyi Lake, and dozens of Huangtian households are Pengjia's debtors. Poor farmer Tang Dingnan had borrowed 18 silver dollars from Peng's family, the interest was four months 1 against this, he was forced to sell Chai Shan for 8 months, the next year sold the paddy field, and in the third year, the house had to be mortgaged, so 18 silver dollars still remained more than 100 yuan, or still not clear. Finally, the wife forced to go as a maid, son flow The waves worked as permanent workers abroad, causing their homes to die and displaced. \\nOne year, the new valley was listed, and the price of the valley plummeted. Peng Xiaochen, son of Pengyi Lake, bought in large quantities with 2 silver dollars and 1 to a valley. By the next spring, farmers had to buy at the price of 12 yuan yuan. In this way, farmers were doubly exploited, but Pengyi Lake's family had a big fortune.. \\nPeng yihu is a big squire in the local area. Peng's nephew is a county senator. His son was a pseudo-guardian, relying on such political forces to enjoy privileges. Peng Jia is a 'direct household' of the township government. The Kuomintang's heavy tax donation is borne by the poor, and it is also the children of the poor, and Peng's family is 'exempt from the takeaway'. In short, pressure and burdens are attached to farmers, while Pengyi Lake is the dominion of local farmers. \\nAccording to the peasants, in Pengyi Lake's home, the poor have no freedom to ask for meals. In one year, a widow, Mai (can't hit the word here), a widow in her 70s, went to Pengjia to ask for meals. Peng family thinks she should not always come to eat, (this word can't be used), and said painfully: 'Hungry stomach, no way, no way to come!' Peng Jia thinks she should not be strong, grabbed the beating, has been beaten all the way around, and finally can't even go, all the way to climb back. Farmers reflect that in the past there were four things to the farmers who went to Pengyi Lake's home: pay rent, borrow money, sell the valley to buy the valley, and asked him to mediate. Usually nobody dare to go, if the peasant goes to sit on a stool, Peng yihu's wife will need the maid to flush with water. His wife went to the farmer's house if something happened, in order to be afraid of the mud stained, he was leaping across the door. Please see how different is the status of farmers and landlords! \\nHowever, after liberation, Pengyi Lake has repeatedly called for the pain of the farmers, pretending to care about the farmers. Well, listen to the peasants of Pengyi Lake's hometown: since you care so much about farmers, why not make kindness at that time? Why is Gong Decai, who has been employed in your house for more than 10 years, still owes you the 10 dan-valley? Why is your cousin asking for dinner while you don't care? \\nPeng yihu: It turns out you are a cat cry mouse, do not have the intention! \\nResistance and destruction of land reform in 1949, Hunan liberated. \\nPengyi Lake knew to carry out land reform after liberation, so on the pretext 'autumn march too heavy', rushed to sell 42 acres of land in 1950. The farmers described: 'Pengyi Lake is like a broth chicken, panicked to sell no matter how much money or less money, he sold it, in this way, he actually got 160 danggu.' However, Pengyi Lake is not willing to allocate land to farmers. As long as they recall this point, they all regret having a big deal for themselves. \\nIn 1950, Hunan Province held a congress of people's congresses of all walks of life and decided to carry out land reform. Pengyi Lake (at that time he was attending the meeting as a representative of democracy), and poor farmer Gong Wenqiu said: 'It is too early to carry out land reform now, you have no livestock, no agricultural tools, three seeds, land is not allocated to you? Woo? This affects production.' He also argued: 'Now we can reduce the rent, land change will be postponed for three years, until you regain your energy.' This is the withdrawal plan made by Pengyi Lake. If it really postponed for three years, Pengyi Lake would definitely sell the Tian two net, then he could rest assured, 'Change it! Change it! My money has been sold anyway.' However, people will not be fooled, and the wheels of history will not reverse the direction. \\nLand reform is under tense progress. Thousands of farmers rose up to fight just against the landowners who were still on their heads yesterday, but Pengyi Lake shouted 'No fight, no fight.' 'The farmer landlords are immoral and damage human dignity.' 'It is immoral to buy a chicken upside down in Hong Kong,' he said. In his view, the Communist Party was worse than British imperialism. Pengyi Lake's real proposition is 'peaceful land reform'. Please see how firm the landlord class position of Pengyi Lake! \\nPengyi Lake not only acted against land reform, defended landowners in rhetoric, but also organized to cover the landlord class retreat. According to the peasant expose, in the land reform, Pengyi Lake concealed a murderer who killed many Communist Party members, captain of the Kuomintang Shovel Communist Party, and the landlord bullies, and introduced his work for him; the other is his nephew and the great landlord of Yueyang, who also introduced his work. \\nAfter attacking the land reform of the food policy that stigmatized the Party, the peasants stood up, so Pengyi Lake changed his strategy, criticized the peasants and attacked the Party's food policy. \\nIn 1954, the country implemented a general food purchase and sales policy, the vast majority of poor farmers and lower middle farmers are actively advocating. They believe that food purchase and sales have three major benefits: stabilizing prices, ensuring supply and promoting cooperation. However, as a result of a national disaster in 1954, there were no experience in the food work, there were some shortcomings in the work, and there were some food tensions in some places, so Peng Yi Lake had drastically attacked and sent a letter to the central government in his capacity as the Central Committee of Civil Construction, criticizing the policy of food purchase and sale of food for bad., said, 'Rural food left too little, a farmer only left 460 pounds of food, not even half enough.' And fabricated the fact that 'the people are unable to eat, lack of physical strength, low mood, and the decline in production', and describe the policy of food purchase and sales as a whole, in an attempt to fundamentally negate the food policy that is relevant to the livelihood of the entire country's people. \\nPeng yihu believes that a working farmer should leave 700 pounds of food a year. But what is the truth? \\nWhat Pengyi Lake said about the people's lack of food? Yes, what era is that? That is the time of the local owners of Lake Pengyi. At that time, many farmers did not eat, but had to eat wild vegetables, eat fennel (soda), rattan, eat fern root, a little wasteful, a lot of going out for dinner. Peasants from Pengyi Lake's hometown had the saying that 'half a year of food, no vegetables for half a year' to describe the situation in the past, but since the introduction of food purchase and sale, it was in 1919 In the year of flooding in 54, there was no one in Huangtian Township, and no one starved to death. Are there any striking facts? \\nPeng yihu said that the people were unable to eat, lack of physical strength and affected production. This is a big lie. Huangtian Society increased production of tens of thousands of pounds of grain last year. Due to the country's policy of increasing production and not buying, the average food rations for the whole society is 520 pounds. This year many farmers have savings. Is it not a clear fact? \\nPeng yihu said that leaving 460 pounds of food is not enough even half, believing that a working farmer should stay at least 700 pounds. This is all the craftsmanship of sitting in the office. Let's take Pengyi Lake's hometown, this township has an average of only 1.62 acres per person, in 1954 grain production average of only 615 pounds per person. If according to Peng Yi Lake's food retention standards, the country not only cannot carry out a general purchase, but also should take the grain out. Everyone knows that food cannot fall from heaven, nor can the majority of urban people drink the northwest wind. What is the purpose of Peng yihu saying this? \\nSo, now the rural food is not enough to eat? The reporter visited the son of Pengyi Lake in the countryside. He was a burdensome man. He said: 'We two people, we need to eat rice, two liters of fennel (soda), silk every day. Last year, we planted 3 acres of lots of fields, harvest 2,200 pounds, except pay. In addition to the general purchase of grain, there are more than 1,400 pounds, we also have fennel 400 pounds, wheat 3, 40 pounds, rapeseed more than 20 pounds, soybeans, green beans more than 100 pounds, mud beans 8 buckets, this year fed 2 pigs, not only enough to eat, there are savings. Speaking of general food retention standards, he said: 'If big and small mouth to eat the main grain, more than 400 pounds will be enough.' When we asked about the general purchase and sale of grain, he said: 'Now the masses are much better than before liberation. They used to eat wild grass, fennel, peasant Gong Honggu before the liberation, it was different last year, and called me to help him make about 4 buckets of glutinous rice.' This is a great misfortune. Pengyi Lake's son slapped his old son with facts. \\nOriginally, Pengyi Lake represents a part of the wealthy farmers who oppose the general purchase and sales policy of grain, and a few wealthy Chinese farmers are attacking the Party's food policy with the position of the landlord class. \\nNot only that, Pengyi Lake also attempts to fundamentally negate the all-food purchase and sales policy. \\nAt the end of June this year, when Gong Dixiang, the Huangtian Cooperative Commission, passed through Wuhan, Peng yihu talked with him about its food retention standards. Finally, Peng yihu asked him: 'If you cancel the general purchase and sales, you can see?' 'No, cancellations are not allowed.' Gong Dixiang's answer is very clear. \\nWhen cracking down on grass-roots cadres, Peng yihu, when attacking the general food purchase policy, he said that district and township cadres were worthless. If they were enemies, he said: 'The working style of the district and township cadres is very bad... All things are forced to order... the farmers' feelings for cadres are very bad.' He also said that the party's meeting of activists was a 'secret meeting' and used all kinds of 'conspiracy' to implement the party's policy. This is totally defamatory. \\nYou can not conceal that some of our cadres have shortcomings in the working style. The masses have opinions, but the vast majority are good cadres of the Party and are supported by the people. Party general secretaries Yao Guohui, Gong Wenqiu, and the president and the social committee committee. They were all poor farmers who had been oppressed and exploited in the past. They grew up from the masses, and they were promoted by the people. The masses believe that they are their own wealth. Farmers praise them kindly as good cadres who are willing to suffer, have a good temper, care about the masses, and have problems with the masses. They are good cadres in Party education. \\nThey care about the suffering of the masses. He Weiqing, organizer member of his fifties, willing to be frozen, gave his own cotton to poor farmers. The masses fervently called him the father. If he went down in rural areas, the masses pulled, dragged and graciously slaughtered chickens for hospitality. In order to avoid waste, he always walked quietly. What is this relationship? Is it 'bad', or flesh! \\nThey will govern their lives, not only have they implemented the Party's policy and care for the masses, that is, Pengyi Lake's son, who was known for having used to smoke opium and gambling, and are now being educated like a person, working and living. Of course, they do have some 'forced orders' and 'very bad feelings.' But they are good for farmers, who see them as their own. \\nPeasants think good, Pengyi Lake thinks bad, farmers think it is wealth, but Peng Yi Lake thinks it is worth nothing. The position is so clear. It turns out that Pengyi Lake looked at the problem in the position of the landlord class. \\nThe people of the landlord class have passed a good day. Pengyi Lake is unwilling. Soon after the land reform, his son even fights (think his father was in Hankou), took back a part of the property allocated to poor farmer Gong Yanhua. Last year, Peng yihu, in the name of 'commemoration', changed a magnetic basin assigned to poor peasants Wan Biyu. The peasants asked: the land in the past was yours and the house was yours, are you also going to commemorate it? \\nA series of facts prove that Peng yihu is not a peasant's 'blessing God', but a right-wing, anti-party, anti-people, anti-socialist who has always stood on the landlord class position. The eyes of the people are snowy, and the original shape of Pengyi Lake is clear. No wonder the 52-year-old Chen (can't hit the word here), said: 'Beware, if the farmers listen to Pengyi Lake, they will re-enter the eighteenth floor of hell, never turn over.' The majority of farmers said with one voice: 'He is easy to change, nature is difficult to move, we firmly stand firm and give him a headache.' \\nThis deserves deep reflection on Pengyi Lake. The vast majority of people can even more identify whether or not, and draw the boundaries from Peng Yi Lake's thinking.

My father slept, I lay on my mother laid a cool mat for me in summer, and in winter I inserted an electric blanket on the wide bed woven palm leaves, suddenly felt that I could not sleep tonight. I enjoy the rush of tears quietly, afraid to wipe with hands will wake up God's farmer's wife, quietly pumped down the pillow, want tears to flow back into my eyes. But the tears still came out, they broke out from the corner of my low-lying eyes, passing through my sideburns, silently wet my shoulders. \\nAlthough I read from the 'Immortal Biography' by Dong Jin Ge Hong when I was a child, my ancestor Peng Hang lived 767 years old and was the brightest birthday of all mankind, but five thousand years later his distant grandson, my father, was a miracle to live to 90 years later. From another book, what I read from my father's Late Gathering is an age of life. He was arrested in jail for opening a grain position, framed by a county collector named Yan Huaizhi, for an ongoing counter-revolutionary crime. The following year, it coincides with the famous human catastrophe and hunger in China's history, with edema and death jail; the more three years, the summer fell to the extreme right to the re-education team, and cholera again crossed the ghost door. In the same autumn, the same room's hard friends could not see a tiny dawn of tomorrow, using the detonators stolen during the day. Self-contained, one handed over to the father, and asked, 'Do you think there is still a sense to live?' Father hesitant, hard friend ignition turned, a riot head separation, plasma splash, the head has been crushed in the air shrouded in a gloomy night. \\nIt is the great and thoughtful of the father, and the party made him steal life today. \\nThereafter, or criticizing, or suffering, or suffering, or suffering, or losing a daughter, he sought to help himself by swallowing his own blood and tears, dismayed as a mice that was blocked by death, running on a vast prison court, struggling, dying and resurrecting. People say that my father can finally come up with the so-called Zhaoxue, and it is also a misfortune. Who knows the grief in his heart to the death! The three-year-old girl only because of the mistaken birth, with a child with a surprise wind, but can not get a class struggle as a criminal doctor in time for treatment, grass generally self-extinct; to find a way out to the poor farmers three children, lost her eyes in the swaddle, grew up reading, although excellent college entrance examination hit, but also because of the impoverished grandson Mountain, and do not understand the mother's bitterness, resentment she should not only send him, outrage out of the river and lake, die in a foreign country. More than twenty years later the remains grew up, repeat the father, wandering, drifting, and again creating homeless souls in the past! \\n'Late gathered' page 412: 'In August 1958, to participate in the meeting of thousands of party members in the county, because selflessly borrowed 280,000 kilograms of food, disbanded the collective canteen, stopped making steel, was declared the current counter-revolution, engaged in the 'independent kingdom' in Tianbao, arrested and imprisoned.' \\nSo the tragic history of blood, in his father was not one person, generation, and implicated his children, children's children, grandson, the crime of Yanduangka that year, actually caused a happy home to collapse instantly, the vines and three generations of tragedy breed by the breeding, until the day when the reproduction and hardship ended the rest of the day...\\nThose who say that the unfortunate father is unfortunate, must be those who are more unfortunate, either killed by the right relatives of that year, or descendants of the right who were out of school, unemployed or lost their ability to play fair. I read in 'Late Clouds,' I read that under Yan Lianzhi, the right, father's hard friends, day and night fight, abuse, died in the distant Xiangbei farm, buried the local Leap into the Bridge, in the Moon Palace pool, dozens of known and named wrongs, and more with a cap. Among these people are my friend's father, father-in-law and uncle who lived only one third of my father's life. Compared with that, is it not a bad luck for a father who lived to 90, is it a big chance of misfortune? \\nHowever, there is no shortage of poor talent, for a fly head big fiction, a bowl of maggot-like meal, a shoulders laughing action and expression to sell false history. Such people, either because of their meager knowledge and talents, were in the past, but lost in the competition for survival in the new era. The more poor simply published 'works' in the network without review, in order to prove that they were also 'writers', and could hunt evil officials from newspapers and documents of the far left years. Sins are meritorious, glorify bad deeds. It is true that this is due to political movements and times, but the same wind, the same wave, the wind, the wind dances are different good and shameful birds, and there are also different fish dragon and turtle turtle in the waves. Born in chaos, choose not one, or hurt, or killed, during which there are still people who prefer to be killed or not hurt, more clean and loved ones will touch the left chest at times, never do the thing to go to hell after death. And born as a ghost, choose time and hidden, timely out, all performances are inevitable. \\nLong Wen bamboo Creek show talent, homecoming, a list of the article title is a minion, and then read the article, no talent, just slave. \\n'Late gathering' page 414: 'September, officially judged to the extreme right, daily to the east door to open fire, pull cars, piling, leap into the bridge. At that time, the far-right elements who died and died at the construction site were teachers Xiong Maoxiang, Chen Shaoren, Chen Shaowu, Yu Changxiao, and County Minister of Industry and Agriculture Propaganda Yu Peitian and Zhuxi tabloid editor Ma Zhisen.

At midnight on December 28, together with the far-right teachers Hu Chunhe, Huang Yuan, Feng Maoyo, Wu Xiutang, Xiao Dashun, and so on, were escorted by a prisoner car to Xiangbei Farm, and the three squadron labor reform. \\nYan Lian, Pingyao people in Shanxi, junior high school culture, I do not know the clouds and rain, rapidly changing, 30 years of Hedong people in the dead, forty years of Hexi also have to live well. Just after ten years, the Cultural Revolution erupted, Red Guards from the place of promotion, pulled back to the land, wearing high caps, black cards, aircraft, butt, was pulled off the head of the head of the head hook 90 degrees, former wealthy sweep, town Kansai seeking a good hanlutian manoeuvre General please small action lighter. Guo Linfei, commander of a villain farmer, one of the eighteen staff of the FHKI, Ke Meifu, double riding a bike to see my father in Huangtuling, inviting him to 'his whole dog day' together, is the gentleman's revenge? \\nAt this time, his father, has since the right concentration camp of Xiangbei farm returned to his hometown, straw hat shirtless, pulled out black legs from the seedfield, climbed up the field, pulled out brass cigarettes, stuffed cigarettes please two smoke bags, Zhuangzi generally laughed: 'What does he do? He has tasted the whole taste today, and will not be the whole person anymore!' \\nCommander-in-Chief Guo, Kee attendant, duo cross the bike, long sighs. \\nMy family fell hard, 21 years of frustration, my brother lost school, but also rural farmers to earn a living. Until Hu Gong Yaobang ruled, 550,000 right-wing flattened the snow, and the dead thought, and the living people saw the sky again, and the father was one of them. Is he exactly fifty, knowing that destiny is going to be reversed, dare not fall asleep on the night of life, but fear that the life of life is very sad, a sleep will long sleep past. He looked back under the light and sat in the day, and suddenly in the early morning a poem:\\n21 years of national disaster, a great disaster went to the gold crown picking. \\nThe snow buried the dead corpse will eventually, spring shine to my country. \\nSaid it was reinstated, what was it? This is the highest level 17 in the Jianguochu County Committee, then 20 years old, thirty years later after a Bute Ma Wen, began to go to the Nanshan tube power station, and then out of the city to make rough cement pipe. His father did not care, consciously much better than being in prison. The only inconvenience was to go to the city, and the old houses in the countryside could not live, and the new units did not allocate accommodation to the reinstated right. So until I went to Beijing, because of the dignity of my son, strongly encouraged him to leave early. In order to reunite my wife and children every year, I bought a house for them in Checheng City between Beijing and Xicheng, located in Wuyan Liulin Road, which is on Beijing Road today. After changing this name, it seems that some people fear me coming back from Beijing, can't remember my parents' home. \\nLin Zhongyuan and the original Yunyang Land Commission compound are only one zebra line, and no accident happened. One day to eat dinner, father and mother went out for a walk, and actually dreamed, met an unforgettable face. It was Yan Canan, who was promoted to the deputy secretary of the Communist Party of China's Yunyang Land Committee because of the crackdown on the right. Of course, he is not a deputy secretary of the Land Committee for a long time ago. China's land committee during the upheaval change has gone, and the deputy secretary Mao has survived. Two stop, look at, smile, move forward, shake hands, miraculously ask, completely not narrow road meet the death and death of the enemy, but a pair of old friends who miss the day and night. Mother's chest has no father wide, or why would singers sing the river of the father's prairie mother? Only listen to the mother to drink: 'Go!' \\nThis monster stored in the brain of the film, quickly rolled back half a century ago, discoloured, once again grasped each other and hurried not to go. Father catching up with his mother, he is really an immortal, a word to determine what the mother wants to say: 'What else to say with him!' \\n'I want to hear him asking where my son is, what my daughter-in-law is, what is the grandson, I can tell him where my son is, what my daughter-in-law is doing, and how about my grandson. I mean to worry about you, our family has come alive and live well, nothing worse than you! You really shouldn't roar this, he didn't ask anything, I would say nothing!' His father sighed, and he felt deeply regrettable. \\nHe was determined to return to the county town a few years later because he missed his hometown, his ancestral people, and the stalls of delicious food, such as bowls cake, sesame cake, and tofu that were extremely difficult to eat during his right-wing career. I sold the house of the future Beijing Road in Checheng, and supported my parents to buy a new house in Zhuxi County, here called Renmin Road. His father lived in the new residence of Renmin Road in Zhuxi and heard the death of an old man who had been sorry to the people of Bamboo Creek. \\nShame the first resignation, greeting has gone unheard. \\nPray for the afterlife of the old house, kindly treat colleagues mo struggle. \\nAfter writing this poem, the father seems to really feel that if this person really can not accompany him to the end of his life, he pray that the two people meet in the afterlife, be a good colleague who no longer has class struggles. \\nI compared a hundred years of life to a long run on the ten ring road, and those up to ten rings can pick up the crown of the group. His father has now run to nine rings, compared to many people who fell at the beginning of the shooting, and who stumbled in order to lead and stumbled others and finally fell, he is already an excellent old athlete. And he was burned with scars, bloody stains, with a life of nine dead dead body appeared in this 10,000 people. He has almost become the leader of his hometown old man, he will also lead, run to the ten ring, the most successful end point. \\nHis father's longevity defeated all health professionals who promoted health knowledge, they let eat fruit, he eats dried fruits, peanut seeds chestnut, and the latter also bites with teeth, boom two pieces, and click four teeth. They let eat vegetables, he eat meat, lean meat and eat pork belly, pork belly is not too addictive to fat meat, gnaw trotter is his hand. They let eat less oil, he eats fried egg rice, named to fry with lard, and soak the oil to the surface of every grain of rice. They let eat seventy percent, and he eat ten full, and eat eight soup balls, four dumplings, and after eating a full bowl of meal, he asked to add half a bowl. They let drink light tea, clear tea, warm tea, he drank strong tea, teas, teas rolled out, a cup of tea, a cup of tea like the one who evaluated the Cultural Revolution at the beginning of the reform, three points are water, seven points are tea, drink three courses, and another cup of new ones. Although he drank at his discretion, punching is invincible, if hung bell, move if the rabbit, every new poetry, will sing loudly, laugh, these many phenomena, all violate the basic principles that the elderly need to be stationary. \\nHe's like a character in the Water Margin, Rutty. Let me not fool, I had expected his return, and he would sit on his balcony one day, like the monk eating dog meat. \\nIt seems he himself thought of it. Last March, suddenly revealed secrets to me, saying that he had the last wish in his life and wanted to find one of his gracious men. Seventy years ago, he was studying in Ankang and hiding away from his family home for desertion, a mountain village named Black Dragon on the border between Hubei and Shaanxi. She left him and her sister squeezed to sleep in a bed to cover him who had lied to search soldiers. If she is still, he wants to see her side, otherwise he could leave the world at any time and bring his regret into the coffin. \\nI asked my friend to find her every way, and the girl is 88 years old, and we protect him with two cars, so that he and his grace will be reunited here after 70 years. I photographed this exciting scene with my mobile phone, and I spoke like a reporter about what power she was doing so. After returning to Beijing, I wrote a novel on this basis. In the month when the publication was published, my hometown called, and the hero's grandmother died. \\nOn another road parallel to a health scientist, I was curious about the mysteries of life, which were originally known to Confucius and then two emperors of the Qing dynasty. During Obama's presidency of the United States, a longevity hometown of the world in Guangxi, China, sent people with a sign that says 'Oh, Bama,' to greet me and several Beijing writers at Nanning Airport to gather style. The county's name is Bama. I saw another brand there, Emperor Guangxu, more than a hundred years ago, quoted the Confucius quote more than 2,000 years ago, and wrote by the Governor of Guangxi to a centenyear-old man named Deng Chengcai in Bamas. The elderly, 60 years old, also participated in the Sino-French war, honored his hometown, bought sugarcane seeds for many years, taught their neighbors the method of planting, and taught everyone to smoked bacon. Light Hue thought for its righteousness, gave plaque and praise. \\nPreviously there is Jia-qing emperor, smell this Bama County's yongding soil jurisdiction Yao people Lan Xiang, Li Kangxi, Yongzheng, Qianlong, Jiaqing four dynasty, life high 120 years old, higher than the sum of the father Emperor Qianlong and himself, so give a wish: 'Star lonely Zhaorui should be surrendered south, land immortal surname blue. Hundred spring and autumn 30 years, four dynasty rain dew a Qin Yan Xia nurturing with Peng Zu, moral interrogation asked old Dan. Flower Armor Zhou Yan Promise, Changsheng treasure seal Lang Han.' \\nI went to Bama, and I heard a beautiful legend that a centenyear-old cried by the roadside, asked him why, the old man said his father beat him, and asked his father why, his father said he did not go to visit his grandfather every day. Legend instead of nonsense, Bama is the world's longevity hometown, because it is the hometown of longevity in the world and is the hometown of China migratory birds, 200,000 counties have 100 year-old people as many as 80. There are three thousand years old tradition inherited here, one is to supplement the elderly, make it a constant source; second is to prepare coffins for both parents, make it worry-free afterwards; three is to do good deeds, Yun Gong, home has more money to repair bridges, build pavilion rain. I also think of my father, when he was suffering because of the opening of a position, how different is this from the food preparation coffin, not doing good deeds, and what is it? In this way, he is also a man of a benevolent lover, and there is no reason not to live long. \\nOn the eve of leaving Bama, Bama County People's Congress director Huang safflower accompanied me to see the night market, and sent someone to take a narrow imitation of 'Weren Shou' sent me, I brought it back to Beijing, as a precious gift collection. With gratitude, I wrote an article describing this trip, called Bama whose birthday shines, published in the year's Guangxi Literature. \\nHis father's ninety shoushi is unprecedented. Friends of Beijing and provincial cities want to celebrate Shou, blocked by me, friends in the city claiming to be a half-day drive, but let me how can I also stop. Secretary gave flowers, county governor sent blessing, former county committee secretary district commissioner Mrs. Kai Kai both dressed in big red clothes, by car personally congratulated. The eldest woman sang the song of self-composing song in the choir. The daughter-in-law from Beijing custom built ninety-nine small peaches, I will give my piety star medal five years ago by the Beijing Municipal People's Government, solemnly handed over to the old sister who served his father all year ago. Friends from distant friends sent poems, local friends hanging out congratulatory calligraphy, dozens of people staged poetry, more than a hundred people to commemorate. \\nThe old life star is like the star arch moon, sitting in the center, wearing a dark black hat, wearing a silver gray tunic, this is his seventy years ago big wedding dress with his mother, only one more rosewood faucet cane between his hands. The benevolent, drank a glass of sake, face like peach blossom, spring breeze whisk sleeves, stupid hand into his pocket, pulled out an oil poem to:\\nThe ninety old man was not deaf, and should be thankful. \\nTaste the peach has been given by the king, and the guests are birthday star. \\n13 November 2017 at 12:00pm written at the old residence of Beijing listening wind building\\n【Author profile】Wild Mang, Chinese contemporary writer, native of Hubei Zhuxi, graduated from Wuhan University.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】Huang Jinye : 'Peng zhixian Zhixian: 'Live, prove your innocence!' (Huang Jin Ye's blog)\\nPeng zhixian Zhixian, Changde, Hunan, born in 1927, 5 years old and lost her mother. The grandfather is a famous Chinese medicine in rural areas, demanding for his father to learn traditional Chinese medicine. The father and son have a gap, and the father went out without knowing the end. Peng zhixian Zhixian has a sister who is three years younger than him, and premature. He was raised by grandparents. In order not to impose a financial burden on his grandfather, he went to a secondary teacher training school, which provided free meals. Secondary teacher graduated and had been tutor for one year in primary school. In 1947, admitted to the Wuhan examination area of Lanzhou University. He was admitted to the first of eight Chinese students in the Wuhan Examination District, considering that he was able to get a scholarship, so he went to Lanzhou University. In 1949 Lanzhou 'liberation', the scholarship treatment for school was unchanged, so he did not join the army and chose to continue his studies. When 'liberating', grandfather practiced medicine, home had a few acres of land, a little cooking while farming was busy, and the farmers were busy hired a few short jobs. It should be classified as freelancers but misclassified as landowners. The reason is that when it was near liberation, several homeless travellers came from the town, staring at a home home. In 1949 and 1950, grandparents passed away, Peng zhixian Zhixian had no money to return home. It became his permanent heartbreak and guilt. \\nIn 1951, Peng zhixian Zhixian University graduated and was assigned to the Party Committee of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region. \\nPang Zhixian's uncle died prematurely before 'liberation', and his family also had a few acres of land, with her cousin and cousin. After 'liberation', the land reform should be classified as small land lessors, but also as landlords. The aunt was forced to dive. \\nCousin Peng zhixian Zhiqi, born in 1924. Private school, admitted to Jiao Tong University Department of Finance in 1945, enjoy public fees. Students admitted to Beijing University in 1946. 'New China' was established, and the Department of Northern Western Language was suspended. He joined the PLA. He studied Marxism at the Central Corps School. He then served as the editorial team leader of Southwest Youth Publishing House and editor of China Youth Publishing House. In the political movement of the 1950s, he joined the Kuomintang when he was appealed to high school and was delegated to work in Suihua County, Heilongjiang. It was only in 1979 scheduled to return to Changsha, Hunan. Former deputy editor of Hunan Literary and Art Publishing House. There is a collection of poems 'Wangyuelu'. \\n1\\nIn March 1957, the Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee verbally conveyed Chairman Mao's 'Issues on Correctly Handling People's Internal Contradictions' and 'Speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference of the Communist Party of China', and the curtain of the Party's rectification campaign opened in Xu Xu across the country. \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian listened to the meeting, knowing that the purpose of the weathering movement is to rectify the ideological style of subjectivity, bureaucracy, sectarianism, and sectarianism that the Party demands that all party members should 'speak unspoken and endless'; know that the approach to wind is 'wind and rain' and 'dare to approve' Comment, dare to argue'...\\nAs a Communist Party member, Peng zhixian Zhixian's blood boils all night sleepless. \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian, 30 years old, tall, white net, thin, see people always laughing, nodding, do not love talking. \\nAfter graduating from university, Peng zhixian Zhixian has prepared a lot of long and short policy propaganda materials, published in the press or printed in brochures. In the autumn of 1956, he was sent to rural Turpan to conduct a social survey. At the end of the year, in the name of the Working Group of the Ministry of Rural Work in Turpan Five Star Agriculture Society, he wrote a summary of the study and inspection of a democratic host society in Turpan, which was published in the Xinjiang Daily, he was included in the Xinhua Monthly Newspaper 'Catalogue of Important Articles in the National Newspaper'. This information caused a small wave in the hearts of the people of the district party committee propaganda department. \\nThe young Peng zhixian Zhixian was a big deal. He is more comfortable with his 'don't run not send' creed. Since working in 1951, he worked in the propaganda department of the district party committee, for more than five years, never gave the middle and upper leadership to pay a new year, nor did he go to string doors, but just buried reading and thinking. He does not know that this time the 'glimpse' and has always been the pride of others, became the curse of his own life. \\nAfter the spirit of the wind meeting was communicated, the propaganda department of the district party committee organized a rural investigation working group. Seven members of the working group, including Huo Ran, Cui Tiansheng, Peng zhixian Zhixian and Tian Hwa were the Ministry of Public Information. Of the four, only Tanhua was not a party member; she was the transceiver of the Ministry of Information. There are also Zou Lu of the District Women's Federation and a young couple. The team leader is Huolan, and the branch secretary is Cui Tiansheng \\nPang Chi Hin knows Holly. At the end of 1956, Xinjiang Daily held a general meeting of several hundred people, and the auditorium of the daily newspaper was filled. The topic of the meeting was to discuss the issue of joining the party. Huo Ran, Baodi people in Hebei, are people in the Huo Yuanjia family. He was rejoined the party, once left the party, presumably participated in the Kuomintang outskirts. Re-entering the party is more cautious. The general party member is spending a branch will discuss it, and for him is the total expenditure meeting. The conference declared that 'after a multifaceted review of the organization, there is no problem and agreed to join the party.' \\nA few days after joining the party, Huoran moved from the Xinjiang Daily to the Department of Propaganda as deputy director. \\nIn early April, seven individuals from the rural investigation team arrived in Aksu. They live in the Aksu Land Committee Guest House, Peng zhixian Zhixian and Cui Tiansheng in one room. On the evening of April 10, the two people spoke, speaking about the question of whether there was a need for the Aksu Committee's propaganda section. Peng zhixian Zhixian said: 'There are so few people in the propaganda department of the Land Committee. There is no need for a branch branch!' Choi Tiansheng said: 'This is an organizational decision!' Peng zhixian said: 'To rethink!' Cui said: 'That is prescribed above, no division is not possible, even a person has to have a section chief.' Peng zhixian said: 'Division of labor is OK!' \\nTwo people, one sentence, I say, say, the argument becomes a quarrel. Two people blushed their neck thick, even gasping also shouting. Between the arguments, Cui Tiansheng came up with the big hat of the 'anti-party' and said, 'You are against the party! This is a violation of the party's decision, and the party decides to set up a branch has his reason, and can still be debated in the matter decided by the party?' Peng zhixian Zhixian thought: 'Your comrade's fire is too great! Why can't you change what the party decided? Has the party chapter been revised two or three times? Isn't there been several major changes in the organization of the party? So long as changing the form of organization is good for building socialism, why not change it? Some decisions are out of time, why can't they be overturned? Some decisions are not suitable for the situation, and why can't you disagree or even reserve your opinion?' \\nAfter the two people quarrel, Peng zhixian Zhixian did not disappear, opening the diary, and after writing some of the above words, continued to write: 'In fact, there are only section chiefs, no clerks, or clerks, but the number of officers and soldiers can't be said to be long word addictions, long word disease, and a little joke. He can't listen to me in particular for long words, jokes, etc., he uses a big hat buckle. I hate this style most, so the two people were noisy.' \\nCui Tiansheng and Peng zhixian Zhixian are about the same age. Cui is Shaanxi Baoji, high school student. When Baoji liberated, Cui did not know that he had worked or was working at home, so he participated in the PLA. He was reinstated to administrative level 18 and upgraded to administrative level 17. Peng zhixian Zhixian could join the army during the liberation of Lanzhou, but he chose to continue his studies, so he took part two years later than Cui Tiansheng, at level 18. \\nThe rural working group went to the rural field to investigate the situation, and to see what internal contradictions exist in the countryside? It is usually one or two people looking for farmers to talk to work in some rural productive labour. Peng zhixian Zhixian went to water at night. Watering, is to guide the water in the canal to a piece of land flow, watching the water of the canal do not run. Run the water, quickly dig a few clay trowels up. That night, Peng zhixian Zhixian did not meet the eye overnight, carrying clipped soil steamed continuously along the drainage canal. \\n'Long' word disease, like a thorn on the heart of Peng zhixian Zhixian. Not a few days, he has talked about the disease several times with people. He heard that the Central Committee had recently decided to abolish the various sections of the Land Commission, and it was a breeze in his heart. When he did not want him to speak of 'long' disease again, Zou Lu, who was in the Working Group, also strongly opposed it. Peng zhixian Zhixian is unhappy with his stomach. He only speaks to himself in his diary: 'I always feel that even if our administration has been cut, it is still not small, how much 'for the people' has been done by these people? The cadres of some organs have been idle in the organs, so they have to turn down. However, as soon as they move to the production unit, farmers and workers are much more sensitive than our leaders. They saw the continuous flow of cadres coming and did not give them many problems solved, and some cadres gave them trouble, so they said: Too many people they feed too many people. People who like to buckle hats also like to talk about this organ do not cut, please listen to the voices of the people!' \\n'Maybe these comrades also feel that the institutions are too large and there are too many cadres, but after thinking that cadres have been reduced significantly, the 'long' will become a 'member'; 'member' to become 'long', it will be even harder to make 'long', then they will have to put the cap on 'abolism' to others.' \\nOn May 1, 1957, the People's Daily published the instructions issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on April 27, concerning the movement of the wind, and the whole country began to 'magnify'. A month later, on June 8, the People's Daily published an editorial, 'Why Is This?' By the middle of June, the country has reached its climax, and even near the end, Cui Tiansheng and Huolan smelled some breath, stealing to talk about what. Huo Ran told Peng zhixian Zhixian that we still need to grasp some more information. You and Tian Hua went to Ushi County to investigate. \\nUsh County is located in the northwest corner of Aksu, 100 kilometers from Aksu. It is a small border county bordering Kyrgyzstan. Pang Zhixian muttered in the heart of the heart, why did I send an assistant to Wushi County? Not to mention that Tian Hua is a lesbian, going down to the country together is more inconvenient. After the incident, Peng zhixian Zhixian understood that that was not any assistant sent at all, but the person who was sent to monitor his words and deeds. \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian and Tian Hua went for about 20 days. When he returned to Aksu, Peng zhixian Zhixian handed over his completed investigation report to Huolan. Huolan did not say anything, looked, and found nothing from it. Immediately Huo, Cui and sent Peng zhixian Zhixian to Awati County. This time did not send field to follow. The aim is to allow Tian Hua to report on Peng zhixian Zhixian's remarks and actions in Ush. \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian came back for about a week or two. He mainly learned some opinions of farmers in the purchase of grain. Peng zhixian Zhixian wrote a few hundred words and sent it directly to the Propaganda Department. Leaders believe that there is still value, they published it in Xinjiang's Branch Life. \\nAt that time, the anti-right movement across the country gradually deepened. Following 'Why is this?' Following the editorial, the editorial department of People's Daily published an article on 'Asset Tier Directions for a Period of Wenhui Report' on June 14, and published an editorial on July 1, 'The direction of asset class should be criticized in Wenhui News'. As a result, the anti-right movement came a 180-degree turnaround, and the 'big song enlarged' to the Party's opinion to help the party's winds turned completely, and the people who made opinions became the object of criticism. \\n2\\nIn early August, the rural working group returned from Aksu to Urumqi. \\nPolitical movements in Xinjiang are half a half late than the major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and the country. When the whole country was sounded, Xinjiang remained unmoved. When the country entered the anti-right-wing phase, Xinjiang began to launch the sweeping. \\nIn August, a nationwide propaganda work conference was held, that is, a general mobilization meeting, and Minister of propaganda, Lin Bemin's mobilization report, let the Party give advice. Xinjiang began to enter the phase of the anti-right movement. \\nDuring the coming week's meeting, Peng zhixian Zhixian was extracted from the conference briefing. That is, every night, the minutes of the discussions of the regional and county propaganda cadre group meetings in Xinjiang were sorted and printed and distributed by the nature of the problem for the attention of the attendees before the next day. Briefings of the meeting were written by Peng zhixian Zhixian by night car. \\nAfter the meeting, the whole territory began to shine, and the propaganda department also began to magnify. On 2 September, the Ministry of Public Information held its first congress. Everyone has to speak at the resting meeting. Peng zhixian Zhixian's debate after the revelation of the whole country has changed to a 'counter-right stage' situation, and also believes that he has always worked seriously, and has worked hard. So he took the recent four months of investigation in the countryside, just said. He said that the achievements of the Autonomous Region Party Committee in the leadership are great, and there is little talk about it here. But there is also subjectivity, bureaucracy. For the issue of food acquisition and retention standards, some places have been tested, and rations standards have been announced to the population (Aingko, Awati County), others have been distributed according to the rations standards (Hunbash II, Aksu County), and the District Party Committee has additional tasks. In this way, food retention standards in these places will be lowered. Kuqa County is said to have changed three times. caused the following work passive, causing masses discontent...\\nPeng zhixian Zhixian speaks with the facts. It is reasonable and reasonable to talk about it. He is quite satisfied with his own statement, and even a kind of self-interest is overflowing in his heart. \\nIn the aftermath, he also said that the deputy minister of rural work should not have mistaken the Xinjiang Oilfield 'Karamay' repeatedly as 'Kemalay' at a report meeting. Because the word 'black oil' means the oilfield, you want to read it wrong, it's not that. He also said that Secretary Wang (Enmao), is not bold to deal with the issue. He saw in the large print paper posted in the yard of the organ that Secretary Lu (sword man), brought back more than 20 pieces of table from Tibet. He said that Secretary Lu bought from Tibet the duty-free and tax exemption form imported from India. This is a violation of national laws and regulations, it is smuggling and an offence. Politically, the impact was bad; financially, the country's income was lost. This issue should be reviewed. \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian believes that he is right to present these opinions to the party and to the party's leaders. It is for the healthy body of the Party and for the more purity of the party's nature. Therefore, he has generously made his statements. Sometimes it's even blushing to argue with others. \\nWhen the big Ming enlarged, the big print in the yard of the District Party Committee was not too many. By the time of the big debate, the big print in the yard of the district party committee was covered. Narrow is a snake out of the hole, and the big debate is focused on fire counterattack. Pang Zhixian Wan did not think that his opinion to the Party, when he spoke frankly, became a shells fired at himself at the time of the big debate? He was basically the only target of the Ministry of Public Information. \\nAt the beginning of the debate, the leading group of the Ministry of Public Information issued to each attendee the attendees 'Pang Zhixian's Speech Records at Several Confirmation Meetings of the Ministry of Public Information' and 'Wrong Speech During Peng zhixian Zhixian's Village' and other oil printed materials. Fight rack type open. \\nThe District Party Committee has several critical key objects. The propaganda department is only one, because he has a university diploma, and is considered an intellectuator. There is also a tiger fly, also a college student. \\nAt the beginning, Huoran old hold a heavy word not to say, while Cui Tiansheng 1 clapped the table to accuse Peng zhixian Zhixian. At that time, Peng zhixian Zhixian knew that when he was still investigating rural areas in Ush County, Huoran and Cui Tiansheng were already collecting his materials. When he went to Awati County, a document signed by Huo, Cui and Tian Hua had been written and reported to the Propaganda Department. \\nEverything is in premeditation. Criticism and controversy are also raging. Later, they obtained the information of the women's federation Zou Lu's denunciation. \\nAt a debate, Huo Ran, deputy director of the propaganda department of the propaganda ministry and head of the working group in the countryside, publicly denounced Peng zhixian Zhixian and the party 'are not a family' and explicitly want to make Peng zhixian Zhixian a right. At that time, Peng zhixian Zhixian also grievances and angry. He attended the party congress in 1956, knowing that he was a backbone of the KMT and that his history was innocent. The angry is that a man of historical innocence has been blamed by a person who jumped out of the sludge water. The grievance is that his own mind toward the party is now a right-wing reactionary party with the party 'not a family'. \\nThe more he wants to get upset, the more he will find the Director of the Propaganda Department, Mullian2. \\nMu Lian, born on February 5, 1922 in Queshan, Henan, a family named Yang. Small name Yang Xingzhen, big name Yang Shuwan, went to Yan'an when renamed. Mu Yi Yang, Mu same voice; the name thought of ancient xinqing integrity and integrity, so in the name of Mu Lian. \\nYang family belongs to the big family, book fragrant door brother. When Ming and Qing, the ancestors were also in the clothes, wearing the flower Ling, a prominent moment. When fathers, the family road fell, but there were still nearly 100 acres of land. His father is good, self-taught as a famous Chinese medicine, is a famous gentleman. His mother is also rich people, quite literally. \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian told Mu Lian that I could not accept the accusations made against me at the critical meeting. I could not accept it. I was sincere to the Party during the day, the conscience of heaven and earth, and my origin was innocent. At the same time, he also talked about some ideological activities, and it was said that Peng zhixian Zhixian, the hurting department, had no reason to shed Mullian said I could understand your mood and advise him to treat the movement correctly, review mistakes profoundly, and also said some comforting words. \\nMoulian's words moved Peng zhixian Zhixian very much. He returned to the dormitory, sat there to froze God for a while, calming his mood, before he walked into the canteen. He looked at a glance, and the cafeteria was full of people, all pouring into his own meals. Speak, chopsticks and bowls form a sonic wave, and Pang Zhi Xian feels irritable. He walked to the window, and he went to a table with no one to sit alone. When he picked up the chopsticks and just went to the dish, he saw Mulian, wife of Minister of Propaganda Lin Bomin, Wu Shaohua, deputy director of theoretical education department and Li Ling, deputy director of theoretical education department. Peng zhixian Zhixian stopped with his chopsticks hand, and his eyes strained on them. The three of them have finished eating and talking about. Mu Lian pointed Peng zhixian Zhixian with his fingers to Wu Shaohua and Li Lingyuan, while saying, while still wearing a bitter face, it is more than a tear. Mullian said that his face had a splendid laugh. Mrs. Lin Bomin Wu Shaohua was 'eating' laughs, and Li Ling was 'haha' laughing. With that 'haha' laughing, Li Ling's shoulders shake shaking...\\nAll of this was fully captured by the sensitive Peng zhixian Zhixian. He really couldn't think about it. He was holding a blood heart to talk to the 'Party', and she, who represented the 'Party', had both factions, said in person to face that it was a ridicule behind the understanding. Is this the image of our party leadership? He had no appetite in the face of the freshly bought meals. In his heart there was an insulted, betrayed anger rushed to his head. \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian got up, quite a chest, step out of the canteen. Go back to the office angrily, take the diary out of the drawer, and write it on the diary with a pen:\\n'Hey, comrade, how are you so cowardly? Since someone says that you and he are not family, you should endure or fight back, why tell a woman and a child? Why add laughter to women and children after a full meal? You coward, you damn it. You should put your women and children when faced with you and say understand you turn around and laugh, as a literary typical of your future work to float her. To let millions of offspring appreciate the ugly face of her poor tongue. To know real friends. Of course, this is not the era of 'broad intercourse', and the snake scorpion is not without. Outside of work, less nonsense. Be careful that the snake used to capture the wind and shadow turn it into your poison juice, it hurts you, it can divert another layer of skin...'\\nPeng zhixian Zhixian writes that only the anger of the heart is vented into paper, and white paper becomes black. \\n'Etiquette · Confucius line' in 'Confucian can not be robbed, can kill and not humiliate', Su Shi's 'Liuhou' has 'pifu see humiliation, pull up sword, stand up and fight, this is not enough for the brave. There are brave men in the world, desperately and not surprised, without reason and not wrath. For somehow, when writing his diary, Peng zhixian Zhixian turned out to be dominated only by Confucius Line, and completely forgot about Dongpo's ridicule and cynical mockery of certain piffs who could not tolerate! Not only that, he also thought of death. \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian is still single, living in a small cottage in the compound of the Party Committee. Single dormitory for two or three people. Indeed, he could not understand his heart of a red heart, came to this end: being criticized, criticized, criticized, ridiculed, tortured, insulted. Can people live on this job? Self-esteem of him, kindness in front of his eyes a dark, he does not see a little light, he thought of death. How to die and what ways to end your life? He does not know. Later he thought, died, died, and everything was gone after death. But a few of you will use 'self-defeating the people' to determine you, and all wrongs will be forever in this word. He thought of ancient Qu Yuan. What is the point of death like him? You die, those few people will laugh laughing and clapping fast! No, can't die! The world is always changing. Live and see the future! So another thought took the upper hand: 'Stay alive to prove that you're not an anti-party! To live, to prove their innocence...'\\n3\\nPeng zhixian Zhixian has the habit of diaries between three and five diaries. People in the Propaganda Department of the Party Committee know. \\nBig Ming enlarged, is the snake out of the hole, big debate is what? The debate is to criticize, do not let you speak at all. Just give a few arguments, you say that you do not confess guilt and have a bad attitude. There is something that can not be said, there is no reason to argue, and what else is there for not writing a diary? Peng zhixian Zhixian did not know that writing a diary was a deadly shells against himself. \\nWen Ye, Chief of the Office of the Propaganda Department and Head of the Wind Leadership Group, asked Peng zhixian Zhixian to hand over his diary. Peng zhixian didn't want to give it, but Wenye said, 'You still hand over, you have come to the edge of the right. Deliver the diary, show loyalty to the party, not to pay is recalcitrant in the end!' \\nThe diary went on for a few days, about the late November, 'Peng zhixian Zhixian Diary Excerpt' printed and issued, and the criticism of Peng zhixian Zhixian will climax. \\nIn the Excerpt of Peng zhixian Zhixian Diary, there are those words of scolding with Cui Tiansheng, there are records of quarreling with Cui Tiansheng. It also indicates that there may be snakes in the revolutionary team, which can cause people to sit on the right sign. This has greatly angered some people, causing them to bloody veats, waving boxing cases and scolding in a new round of criticism. Cui Tiansheng pointed to Peng zhixian Zhixian and said, 'You are a viper in the party!' Peng zhixian Zhixian knows that by these alone, he can be hit as a right-wing element. \\nRepeated fierce criticism caused Peng zhixian Zhixian no longer to justify at the meeting, because he had been exhausted and had to bow his head to confess guilt. On December 19, 1957, he surrendered 'Self-Criticism'. However, at the end of 'Self-Criticism', he still asked to retain his party membership. \\nWhile they were preparing Pang Zhixian's opposition material, Mu Lian allowed Peng zhixian Zhixian to prepare a brochure for propaganda. Peng zhixian Zhixian said: 'My thoughts are messy like a hemp. Where can I write it out?' Mullian said, 'No, you have to write!' 'I can't write it out!' 'Can't write it out and write!' \\nTo hear this sentence, Peng zhixian Zhixian had to retreat quietly to make it difficult. \\nIn March 1958, at a meeting of all cadres of the Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee, the decision to classify Peng zhixian Zhixian as 'ordinary right-wing elements' was announced, and he was given a typed oil stamp finalised material, namely, 'Peng zhixian Zhixian's Right Word and Deeds'. The punishment is mainly for dismissal of party membership, demotion, downgrading, and decentralization of labor. \\nTo the surprise of Peng zhixian Zhixian, the subjectivity, sectarianism and Wang's unbold opinion on handling issues in 'Peng zhixian Zhixian's Right Word and Deeds Material' are all in the right-wing criminal evidence, while Secretary Lv Jianren brought back from Tibet more than 20 tables imported from India was not mentioned in the case material. \\nThe diaries that were forcibly taken away were returned again. Peng zhixian Zhixian took over the diary, and tear it off in a few cases, thought, 'What kind of diary do you write?' And determined to work well after going down, be a loyal citizen, let them see if I am an anti-party, if I am a big viper in the party! \\nThe next day when it was declared a right-wing, Peng zhixian Zhixian bought a bus ticket and rushed to the designated Turpan Five-Star Agricultural Association, receiving the supervision of more than a dozen propaganda cadres who had already worked out there first. At that time, Peng zhixian Zhixian had not had time to carefully read the right-wing words and deeds, and to find out many of the inaccuracies and many intentional falsifications. \\nTurpan five-star agricultural society, is the district party committee rural work department stationed a cadre group of pilot societies, is also Peng zhixian Zhixian in the autumn of 1956 where investigation was written into a democratic host society summary report. This time, Peng zhixian Zhixian is working and repairing drains in farmland together with commune officials. Although he is labor-intensive and sweaty as rain, he never forgets the big hat of the 'right-wing, reactionary' wearing on his head. He was very disobedient. \\nDuring the National Day, he took a leave to Urumqi and wrote a letter to Minister of Propaganda of the Autonomous Region Party Committee Lin Bumin at the hotel, saying: 'Mr. Lu Xun said that the most painful life was awakened without a way to go, I think such times are gone. In a socialist society, perhaps the most painful thing in life is: a person's understanding of his mistakes, the conclusion of a party's mistakes that he has made, can not be complicit...'\\nLin Bemin read the letter and summoned him. He taught him, 'Do not be mistaken again!' At that time, the right was classified into five categories, one or two were extreme right, three were senior intellectuals and four or five categories were general right-wing elements. Peng zhixian Zhixian belongs to the fourth category of right-wing demotion. Lin Bemin's saying is, 'If you do not obey, you can immediately upgrade you to the extreme right'. After the words,Immediately after he said another sentence,You don't be in Turpan,You go to Dabancheng Donggou Township in Urumqi County to participate in the mining team! \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian listened to this word, only without words! \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian took his luggage from Turpan's five-star agricultural society and arrived at Daka Castle. He walked off the car alone, carrying his luggage and carrying a suitcase to Donggou Township. Get off the place from Donggou Township "},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "is still a good distance. The more he felt that the luggage was not moving, the more he felt far away, the eyes were dark, the box on the hand was more and more heavier, so put the suitcase to the Gobi beach, only carrying covered luggage kept walking. When dark, he walked to the mining brigade and lived in the evening to a villager's house. Return to Gobi Beach the morning the next morning and get the box back. The box contained some of his books and some clothing. \\nAlthough more than a dozen right-wing groups in Xinjiang Daily were also in Donggou Township, he and they were not yet together at this time. Pang Zhixian is mining iron ore with members of the mining brigade together, digging a flat furnace and eating a large pot of rice in the public canteen. Tuflat furnace swallowed iron ore, but it was useless iron slag. Tuping furnace iron making ends in failure. District Party Committee decided to build two 28 cubic meters of small blast furnace in Ganhezi, Fukang County, and set up Tianlong steel factory. The new steel mill was built and the staff was not enough, and it was decided to hand over this group of right-wing elements from Xinjiang Daily in Daban Chengdonggou to the Tianlong Iron and Steel Plant for use. \\nIn 1957, the Xinjiang Daily News Agency reacted against the right, and there were 19 people divided into the right. Han's editorial department has more than 90 people, drawing 15 right-wing. In addition to Yu Zhenwu 5, Wang Xinquan, Wang Liang, Lin Yongnian, Yuan Ding, Yelen, Yu Fei, Kaolin, Wang Hongjia, Yang Shenglong, Zhang Zhongzhi, Xiao Lian, Xiong Anqi, Tian Yi, Wen Bin, the right, the right, the right, Changji, the West Gobi Farm, Korle Weili Lake in Southern Xinjiang. Dur Ying, Chen Xuexin, Zhang Yunshan then arrived in Bancheng Donggou Township to participate in the big steel production (Mengdu did not go to Donggou Township, later Direct to the Tianlong Steel Factory). The seven in the furnace Yuen Street Detention Centre were the heaviest to deal with, the far right. Working in Donggou Township is less convicted. Among them, Wang Hongjia, Gaoling and Zhang Zhongzhi belong to supervise labor, while Mengdu, Xiao Lian, Yang Shenglong, Yu Fei, etc are all relegated to disciplinary action. \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian was told to meet with more than a dozen right-wing elements of the Xinjiang Daily to dig coal at the Tianlong Iron and Steel Plant in Xiaohuangshan. \\n4\\n1959 New Year's Day, a big truck carrying 120 people from Daban City Donggou Township approached the road on the same day reached the Xiaohuangshan coal mine in Fukang County. \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian is caught in the right wing of the Xinjiang Daily News Agency, there is no word. These people he didn't know, and this time he didn't want to know. No one in the car speaks, only the roar and whistle of the motor outside the car. They don't know where small Huangshan is? Do not know what small Huangshan is like? In fact, they didn't think so much, but a mindset of fate. The car struggled on the ice and snow highway. \\nAt Xiaohuangshan, they unloaded their luggage and necessities and began to take tents in place. The tent is a cotton tent, the tent is divided into two rows, the middle left only a narrow passage. One and twenty people squeezed in a large tent, one next to a man. Tent on the door of a stove made of gasoline barrels, fire, added coal. The most important thing that can dig up coal is coal. Furnace flames through, melting the snow and ice inside and outside the tent. The cold on the floor is heavy, good that everyone is very young, also anti-frost. \\nEat breakfast, team leader assigned tasks to everyone. There are coal digging, there are coal transported. There is also a division of coal digging, and there are those who have drilled old wolds, and there are piers, and coal The person who assigned the task is the Xinjiang Daily. He knows exactly the situation of these dozen right-wing groups. Who is heavy, who is lighter, who should not have delineated into the right, and who is more stubborn. He will assign different labor intensity to these right-wing groups according to different circumstances, and the work assigned to Peng zhixian Zhixian is to drill the old nest. Drilling old Wozi is the heaviest living After the captain assigned, there is an old worker to tell you how to drill the old nest, how to hack pier, how to transport coal out and digging coal matters should pay attention to. \\nXiaohuangshan coal mine is mined coal mine. This old shaft under Peng zhixian Zhixian for the first time was on a flat ground clipped between two mountains and a depth of tens of meters. Peng zhixian Zhixian came to the wellhead, black deep bottomless, head over a touch of fear, also felt novelty. He took a pointed head, with his hand on the ladder, and went down one level from the wellhead probe. A wooden ladder connected with a wooden ladder, people also by a level of a well wall, a ladder down. After about a dozen meters of darkness and darkness, he saw the light of the oil lamp. The dusk glow illuminates the high and deep coal-mining lanes that reach both ends, stacked and stacked. Keep down to tens of meters deeper, before going down to the bottom. Not far from the bottom, you see a little light of nature, that is to raise the bottom of the other well head of the coal. The derrick on the wellhead, fitted with a winch, can be pushed by manpower and pulled by the donkey, the rope on the winch raises a basket of coal out of the wellhead. \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian is doing the work of drilling the old wok in the underground, kneeling on his knees and waving the pointed points. The tip is about the same tool as the crosshake, the difference is that the crucix is pointed, one is flat, and the two ends of the tip are pointed. The tip of this head is blunt, change the other. Excavate a hole that can fit, and the oil lamp is placed on a small table where the hole wall is self-digging. The oil lamp is the kind of pottery firing a little bigger than a fist, filled with vegetable oil, and a cotton wick burns a little flames. Oil lamp flashing, will cause gas explosion at any time, which we all know. But the underground gas concentration is not to the burst point, no one can figure out. In the heart of Peng zhixian Zhixian understood that when it came to the coal well, the life was handed over to the coal well. Once down, die alive by the days. If the coal seam in the well is wide, it can be separated by two people to drill the old nest. The rear excavator can stand up and widen the hole in front into a cave-like coal roadway. Then the person behind can also split the coal in the lower part of the roadway more than a meter deep, called pier. Their tool can be the head, and out of coal is the fastest. People who split pier do not fall, can stretch the limb and throw away the dry, but the body to be strong, to be strong. The man who drills the old wok most stifled, have to kneel dry, such as pupa before Hand constantly waving the tip, coal crumbs falling, coal dust filled with small space nowhere to spread, thickly fluttered into the nostrils, breathing into the lungs, eye nest, hair, neck, not to mention. At noon, pulled out the two nest heads of the belt, gnawed and continued to dry, has been in no day black hole to dry enough eight hours to climb out of the well. \\nReceipt back to Inoue to see the day bright, people became a coal carving: the whole body is the same as coal black, face, nose, eyes, ears no place is not black, only the teeth exposed when the mouth is white. The black surface of the whole body can wash white after all, just the coal dust in the lungs, can never be washed off. For a long time, it may be an incurable disease 'silicon lung'. It is in this way that many workers who are mining coal in Turkey lost their labour force until they die early. The first thing from downhole to the inoue is to put a blunt tip to the stove to burn red, hammer sharp, quench, and then use it the next day. The mountains lack of water, no bathhouse, have to scrub the whole body with washbasin end water. In the winter and spring season, the mountain temperature is usually below zero ten degrees or even twenty degrees, all over the ice and snow, and have to put ice water into the tent on a large stove made of gasoline barrels. A tent lives twenty people, everyone must move fast, before you can not affect the scrub and sleep of others. Sometimes just asleep, or just entered the dream, and was screwed by the whistle of the unloading car and drinking. The next day has to get up as usual to dig coal, must not have a half delay...\\nEveryone knows from the chief that the other end of the shaft is close to the underground spontaneous fire layer and cannot continue to dig. At the other end there are droplets dripping, coal mining people have to wear raincoats rain boots. Continuing deep, more difficult. So they were instructed to move to an old oblique well. \\nThe wellhead of the inclined wells in the bare of the coal seam on the slope, homeopathic boring forms The top and two walls of the inclined wells have round wood support, and there is little support in the deep hole. Peng zhixian Zhixian is still drilling the old Wozi, and Kaolin and others behind the pier. Inclined wells are not the same as shafts are the newly added donkey and donkey catching people. One of the people who catch the donkey is called Yu Fei, one called Yang Shenglong. \\nOn the late spring day, Peng zhixian Zhixian is excavating in the coal well, and suddenly the top came to crumble when crumbling. When a large slump of coking coal collapses, even if immediately stuffed with lanes, it will not emit a big bang, just rustle. Peng zhixian Zhixian felt bad things happened, and the people behind it had stopped digging. The head of the group Kaolin let not move in place. It is impossible to run out or send lunch in this time. Everyone had to listen to the fate. There is no talk, no choking, no cry, no sigh, some just silence, silence, or internal anxiety. \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian sits in the old Wozi, even lazy down that step a little stretch, just sitting there and guarded the oil lamp. It is estimated that the oil in the oil lamp is gradually decreasing, and the flame continues to shrink until it shrinks into a piece of fire, until there is oil to extinguish. He knows, that's because of lack of oxygen. Thereafter, he felt chest tightness and dizziness. How long has it been trapped in the well? He didn't know much, nor did he care much, even less willing to ask others. Since it was divided into the right, Peng zhixian Zhixian gradually developed the habit of a little speech, and he saw that none of them speak, I'm afraid that one of the words that leaked his mouth has become a recalcitrant. \\nIt was not known how long it took. Pang Zhi Xian in the dizzy heard an asymptotic clash. Suddenly someone hello: climb out! So he went down the steps of the old nest, and climbed out with the back of the men in front. Crawling, he saw a light penetrating from the small hole, he climbed, only found himself standing in a dozen meters deep into the patio. The rescued people hung those in distress to the ground one by one with wicker baskets. People who hang on the ground, there is no kind of sadness when meeting after taking off the risk, after the big mourning. Everyone is very calm, and there is no different face on the face, as usual out of the pit road from work. Peng zhixian Zhixian was fortunate to be able to take off his risk. After all, there are good people who want to save their lives even if they are 'reactionaries' in distress. He felt a hint of warmth. \\nAfter breaking off the inclined wells, the right were instructed to move to the coking plant in the Shagou to dig coal in April. \\nA new coal mining slant well opened in the sand ditch, the quality of coal is not very good. It took a breath that summer came, life was a little comfortable, lived no longer a cotton tent, but the old house of the villagers. Peng zhixian Zhixian bought a mining book. He wanted to know the basics of coal mining. The old coal master went out to survey, and sometimes took him on, climbed to one hill after another looking for coal. He looked north, a large number of mountain heads crowded like a desert grave to the foot of the mountain, and farther away from the infinite desert Gobi, that is the southern edge of the Junggar Basin. Yamano made people's eyes open. Peng zhixian Zhixian almost forgot about being a person wearing a right-wing hat, but also forgotten the many depression and troubles accumulated in his chest. \\nThe master told him how to see the coal veins and how to concentrate, he listened quietly. (Next bis)\\n5\\nIn August, Tianlong Iron and Steel Mill came to notice that the right sent back to the factory headquarters to build a house. \\nShortly after the construction of the Xinjiang Tianlong Iron and Steel Plant began, a group of workers from Taicang County, Jiangsu, needed a lot of supporting facilities and infrastructure: department store department, flour factory, oil press factory, sauce vinegar factory, photo gallery, school, dormitory and other buildings, Peng zhixian Zhixian became a construction worker. When Peng zhixian Zhixian is building bricks on the scaffolding, it is not expected that the rope tied to the scaffolding suddenly broke, Peng zhixian Zhixian and the wooden planks on the scaffolding and the bricks stacked on the plank fall together. Although his injury was not too heavy, but also made him out of a cold sweat, on his chest rib a more than ten centimeters of steel, a little more than a few centimeters, that steel will be like a sharp spear through his chest cavity. \\nAfter the completion of the infrastructure, Peng zhixian Zhixian was transferred to the iron-making workshop to do miscellaneous work. In front of the 28 cubic meters of blast furnace, the dump truck on the earth rail has not been completely cooled, still with some red slag, and in the back of the blast furnace with high and abdominal wood wheelbarrow push coke, or use a dwarf iron car to push crushed ore for blast furnace feeding. Anyway, he would do what he did by assigning him to do. There was no grievance. All he wanted was to survive, prove his innocence and prove that he was not an anti-party. \\nAfter a dozen people in the Xinjiang Daily, several were famous, Wang Xinquan's father was Wang Fuquan, a famous figure of the 5.4 period Zhejiang New Cultural Movement, Yu Fei 6 was the eldest son of Yu Dafu and Wang Yingxia. Mundo is the prince of Mongolia. Wang Xinquan 7 was sent to the Caohu Reeducation Farm in Southern Xinjiang. Yu Fei first arrived in Bancheng Donggou Township for mining big iron and steel, and later to the Tianlong Iron and Steel Factory, and Mendu was almost a year later than they came. After he was hitting the right, the newspaper was not staffed enough to write, and after he made another section of the newspaper, he went to the Tianlong Iron and Steel Factory. As soon as he arrived at the Tianlong Steel Factory, he was assigned to the vegetable team. \\nMengdu formerly known as Hyperlink 'http://baike.baidu.com/view/498255.htm\\\\\\ n _blank all Baia, and later renamed Meng Chi North, HYPERLINK 'http://baike.baidu.com/view/5318.htm\\\\\\ n _blank Inner Mongolia Hyperlink' http://baike.baidu.com/view/418334.htm \\\\\\ n _blank Ejina flag person. 1947 in HYPERLINK 'http://baike.baidu.com/view/7537.htm\\\\\\ n _blank Kunming University (Present  HYPERLINK 'http://baike.baidu.com/view/937361.htm\\\\\\ n _blank Kunming University), to attend school transport, then went to the liberation area of Subei, he served as the reporter leader of the Sunan Daily, HYPERLINK 'http://baike.baidu.com/view/94818.htm\\\\\\ n _blank Xinhua Daily, deputy leader of the industry group, 'Yuhua' editorial department novels. Literary creation began in 1955. In 1957, he was transferred to Xinjiang Daily as deputy leader of the Xinjiang Daily Industry Group. The anti-right movement began two months after the transfer, and the Propaganda Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee came to a letter and read out the problem. The time to criticize him was short, and finally the newspaper left one indicator, trade-offs between him and Xu Shuchao. Xu Shuchao is the head of the Finance Group. Fuwen, chief editor of the newspaper, president and deputy minister of propaganda department of the district party committee, said that Mengdu has no problem, a Mongolian, let's count. Finally called and asked the people of the Propaganda Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee. People from the Propaganda Department of Jiangsu Province said, 'If Mengdu is not the right, there will be no right in the world.' This sentence pushes Mendu to purgatory. \\nYu Fei went from Fuzhou to Singapore at the end of 1938 with his parents. In 1940, Wang Yingxia and Yu Duff returned to home alone. Yu Duff and Yu Fei father and son are dependent in Singapore. After Japanese troops invaded Southeast Asia, Yudafu was trapped in a town in the Philippines under a pseudonymous business cover. Hu Yuzhi returned to his country, Yu Duff brought him 14 years old Yu Feito back to Chongqing. At the beginning, Yu Dafu wanted to entrust Yu Fei to Shen Congwen of the Southwest United Nations General Assembly, but was afraid to cause difficulties for the Qing poor Shen Congwen, and finally to Chen Yi, who is the secretary-general of the Executive Council in Chongqing. With Chen Yi's concern, Yu Fei studied Zhejiang University. In 1949, Yu Fei graduated from the Department of Foreign Languages, Zhejiang University. In 1950, Yu Fei enrolled in the press school run by the Information Department of the Beijing Government Council. Journalism schools are tantamount to college students, and journalism schools are difficult to test. 3,000 people across the country enrolled 150 people, 800 in Shanghai, 30. Of the 90 people who graduated from that news school, Yu Fei, Wang Xinquan, Zeng Bin, Zhang Yujun, Wu Zhenhuan, Luan Shizheng (Jingyan), were divided into Xinjiang. In addition to Wu Zhenhuan to Xinjiang People's Radio Station and Zhang Yujun was later transferred to the Xinjiang People's Press Propaganda Department, the rest of the Xinjiang People's Publishing House. All four are in Xinjiang Daily. Against the middle of the right, the six people in Laijiang are classified as the right. \\nIn 1954, Yu Fei and Xinjiang Radio broadcaster Mou Cuizhen married, loved one beautiful and very good relationship. \\nYu Fei is quite talented, foreign language level is high, but do things, speak casually, I do it, is a free and dilapidated person. In 1957, Yu Fei was on a business trip, so there was no 'sweeping speech', and in a subsequent review of the 'anti-right struggle', the superiors instructed that 'the number of right-wing people defined by Xinhua News Agency Xinjiang Branch did not meet the prescribed target' and asked for one to be added. At this time, Wang Ren, a living friend of Yu Duff and Chinese ambassador to the Philippines, revealed that Yu Duaf had served as an interpreter for the Japanese gendarmerie, but he did not say the fact that he was killed again by the Japanese gendarmerie, he considered his father a traitor, and was implicated as a right. \\nBeing classified as the right, it is a catastrophe for individuals and families. Of the 19 people classified as the right in Xinjiang Daily, families have changed due to social pressure. \\nIt is not surprising that the true 'right' is divided into the right, but there are also those who have left as the right, and even people who don't have anything else can be classified as the right. Kaolin is one of the left divided into the right. Although Kaolin is the left, it is honest and does not mix with private interests. When he was instructed to report on the anti-right movement at the Daily Daily News Agency, he was beaten into the right when he reported the anti-right situation of the newspaper. Kaolin was the webmaster of the Xinjiang Daily News Agency in Kashgar. The reporting rate of documents in Kashgar is high in other regions. Others think he has any trick, in fact, no tricks, but his thoughts are all on investigation, interview and writing. After Kaolin became the right, a group of people vigorously encouraged the separation of his loved one, and his loved one had nothing to expose him. He offered to divorce his wife, and he did not see him again. \\nWang Hongjia, Hunan Liling people. In August 1949, joined the army, entered the Chinese People's Liberation Army, China South Army, Great Hunan Branch. After graduation, it was assigned to the Northwest Military Region 'People's Army' newspaper. In October 1954, the Xinjiang Military Region 'Xinjiang Liberation Army' newspaper. In May 1955, he was transferred to the Chinese editorial department of Xinjiang Daily. \\nWhen Wang Hongjia went to Xinjiang Daily, he studied at Marxinism Institute. Lang Ke is good at pulling relations, and after learning back to talk specifically to Wang Hongjia, but also took the initiative to be king of party introducers. When it came to light in 1957, people had a lot of opinions on Ronco. Wang Hongjia inserted a sentence, saying, 'He has the temper of talent, but he has no talent.' Wang Hongjia's wide knowledge, sharp vision, love ancient poetry. Fu Wen conveyed the speech of the central leadership, saying that cadres cannot take their families to evacuate, so since ancient times. He Zhizhang's poem, 'A little away from home boss back, the Heung Yin has not changed the temples', that is to say this! Wang Hongjia said that this poem is not exactly the same as the Tang Dynasty Changling, 'The young women in the girlings do not know about it. Spring makeup on Cui Lou. Ignored the forehead willow color, repentance son-in-law find 'exact. At that time, it was only the central leadership speech, but it was not known which leader of the central government was. Xiao Du said you can't speak that way. This is Chairman Mao's speech. Wang Hongjia said that Chairman Mao also had to think independently! At the beginning of criticism, Ronco arranged Yan Jinsheng wrote 'Red armor black?' of the article to Wang Hongjia, saying that you think you are a revolutionary, and Chairman Mao said you must think independently. Are you really red or black? In fact, the speech conveyed was Liu Shaoqi's speech. Wang Hongjia did not have a lot of remarks when he came to light, but others spoke he inserted a lot of words, causing others to remember hate being classified as the right. Finally, expelled from public office, expelled party membership, gave 20 yuan a monthly living fee of 20 yuan, and delegated supervision of labor. \\nZhang Yunshan is a proofreading section of proofreading, is a very honest person. During the anti-right period, a person from the proofreading section and the chief of the section was hospitalized. When he went to see, he was beaten to the right. \\nYu Fei was divided into the right after someone wanted to protect him. After going to the Tianlong iron and steel factory, first in the coal mine catch donkey and then to the vegetable team. The vegetable team has more than 100 people, mostly from rural Jiangsu. Yu Fei was drawn to work on general affairs. General affairs was his most reluctant job. He often picked up books and read books at the end of his work. He loves English and enjoys studying the history of Central Asia. In the opinion of others, his job was too easy, said he was not good to transform, hard to find the stubble, opened a critical meeting, after the meeting he was very uncondoned. Yu Fei is very talented, good foreign language, also a little proud. He saw the silent Peng zhixian Zhixian also loved to read books, so the two people occasionally talked a few words. \\nIn addition to the right's supervision of labor, there are also periodic jury sessions, which are far from the 'four Qing Dynasty' movement began to study after the Cultural Revolution. Jury, is to summarize, report, others review from both aspects of labor study. To inflict your own guilt on yourself, you will not give yourself a crime, prove that your transformation is not so good. Yourself curse yourself, the more ruthless you curse, it will prove that the better your transformation, do not curse yourself is no transformation good. Also write text material to surrender. \\nBefore the National Day in 1959, Tianlong Iron and Steel Factory right molecule assessment, Kaolin and another right-wing molecule were approved by the factory's original unit to remove the right member hat, setting up a good model for transformation. \\n6\\nIn the spring of 1960, the country was in the midst of hunger and hunger. \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian pushed an iron dump truck on the railway track of the iron making workshop at Tianlong Iron and Steel Factory. The dump truck was filled with steaming iron slag, the depths of the iron slag are hidden dark red, Baidu's high temperature waste heat, smoked with Peng zhixian Zhixian. The sweat on his face rushed out of a sweat stain in the dust, a burst of starvation in his stomach, he made all his power to push, straight into Venus before his eyes, he vigorously alive, he had to work alive. His monthly food ration is 40 pounds, 40 pounds into a meal ticket and how many pounds are there? I'm afraid to add water is not enough 40 pounds. The slogan of 'encouraging energy, striving upstream, how fast and good to build socialism' and 'Super British catching the United States' are still shining on the earth wall. More than a meter seven, he was skinny in his purse bones and walked some shake. Four beds make up the small dormitory full. His sweater and a few things were gone and the dorm lived for 4 people. One of the four is the right in Fukang County, almost 10 years old. The door of the dormitory is not locked, and a broken box does not matter. Famine years can not even be saved, but can hold their own piecemeal clothing? Money and national bonds are loaded on the body, carry it with you, put in the dormitory is equal to being placed on someone else's hand. There are post offices, restaurants, shops, and a special shop on the side of the Kankako road. The restaurant can not buy meat dishes, special shops are dedicated to how many level or above leadership. Peng zhixian Zhixian turned inside, items are more abundant than ordinary shops, have thorns or anything. He didn't ask how much money a pound, he asked. Urumqi high-priced stores, 16 yuan for a pound of dim sum, he bought Wang Hongjia twice. The taste is really good, but a few mouths are finished. The director of the Xiaohuangshan coal mine is Yang Lai, who was transferred by Xinjiang Daily News Agency. Yang came to know Wang Hongjia no problem. Wang Hongjia did not dig coal in Xiaohuangshan coal mine for a few days, he was transferred to the coal mine for purchase, often went to Urumqi to purchase. Dim sum is delicious, but it is also a cup of water. Steamed high yield in the cafeteria, water is diluted with fire, looks tenacious, hand pinch into a lump, two or three is gone. Peng zhixian Zhixian is already hungry as an adult, thinking of behind it. There is nothing behind, he has long been a man. A little closer is a cousin, cousin. Cousins in the North deserted, dead and alive, cousin's home, little contact. He went to the Tianlong Iron and Steel Factory Photo Gallery and photographed himself, leaving an image of his death in case he died. He looked at the photo that was skinny as a firewood stick, and felt ridiculous, people were not there, and who left the image to? \\nA young daughter-in-law who cooked food in the cafeteria was named Li, who was about the age of Peng zhixian Zhixian. Look at his skinny look, and sometimes give him a little more than a pinch or a spoon when selling for meals. Perhaps thanks to the little daughter-in-law occasionally gave more to the one, he saved a life to prove his innocence. She lives not far from Peng zhixian Zhixian. When Peng zhixian Zhixian had not left the steel mill, she and her husband left the Ganhezi. \\nFull overhaul of blast furnace in the summer and autumn season of 1960. Next to the hot-blast furnace has been excavated a deep pit of two meters square, the underground brick gas pipeline that guides the blast furnace produced gas, has collapsed more than half a meter. The head of the supervision of the right sent Pang Zhixian to repair it. Peng zhixian Zhixian did not say that he went with a knife, trowel leaf, with a cement bucket. Walking to the pit, he smelled a strong smell of coal, choke him to breathe. In order to complete the task in time, he jumped into the pit without much thought. The pit is more than two meters deep, standing in the pit can not see the ground. Peng zhixian Zhixian hands and feet cleaned up, complete, and finally smooth the appearance. He did it for more than half an hour. In his nervous work, he only thought of work, and enduring the suffocating gas, but just after the repair, he wanted to vomit. Knowing that this was a critical moment, he was desperate to climb the pit wall with his hand to climb up. Just climbed to the pit, his head and chest exposed the ground, he fell in the pit along the dizzy past. \\nSeveral young masters were on duty at a dozen meters away from him and found someone dizzy by the pit, and they used to lift him to a shade. \\nWhen Peng zhixian Zhixian came awake, he found himself lying on the upper hand next to the blast furnace more than ten meters away from the pit. He looked at the young masters who had just laid down his hands and feet at the edge of the blast furnace and understood that they left when they brought him here to make artificial breathing and watched him wake up. \\nHe was thankful in his heart. Slightly slower, he slowly stood up and looked at them with pious gaze, bowing slightly to thank them for their salvation. After that, he went to the pit, again went down to the pit to check the repair of the gas pipe wall, pick up the tile knife, trowel leaves and cement buckets, and went to do something else...\\nOn the eve of the National Day in 1960, after the right-wing jury meeting, Tianlong Iron and Steel Factory Department reported the assessment materials of Peng zhixian Zhixian's labor to the propaganda department of the Autonomous Region Party Committee. According to Peng zhixian Zhixian's labor performance and ideological transformation, it is proposed to remove his right-wing hat. District Party Committee propaganda Department quickly approved: 'This person pleaded guilty is not deep!' The leader found Peng zhixian Zhixian to talk, saying that although you work well, your original unit thinks that your knowledge is not deep and"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": " should work well. Peng zhixian Zhixian knows that Mu Lian is still the head of the propaganda department of the district party committee. In particular, Cui Tiansheng has been promoted to the deputy director of the Party member education department. How can he be reformed under their hands? He knew that the alleged guilty plea was not profound, but he did not express his close proximity to the anti-right activists in the original unit, did not go to the door, and failed to be beaten on the left face, as Jesus said, and quickly sent the right face again! \\n7\\nTianlong iron and steel factory is a regional-level factory mine, 1961, the factory department received the notice of the district party committee 'right elements picking caps without the original unit review'. Before the National Day this year, a group of right-wing activists including Peng zhixian Zhixian took off their right hats and moved out from the iron making workshop to the workers' vegetable team to cultivate vegetables and keep their duties. The captain of the vegetable team is Li Dequan, who was delegated by Xinjiang Daily to the steel plant. The deputy captain is Gaoling. \\nThe vegetable team is on the edge of the plant, near the foot of the mountain. Later, Peng zhixian Zhixian was assigned to an abandoned land wok to live alone. The construction of the earth nest is to dig up a flat ground along the slopes, using the three sides of the earth pit for the wall, then with mud branches up four walls, and then use rough branches for rafters, rafters on grass, clay clay, and then the door became a small shed. Shack is small, only enough for one or two people to live. Far from the factory area, head blue sky and white clouds, in front of the eyes radish cabbage, or cauliflower fragrance, or green eyes, compared to digging coal drill old nest in Xiaohuangshan, compared to iron workshop push ore, push iron slag, or scaffolding wall, much easier. He appeared in front of his eyes. There are a lot of people in the vegetable team, and many people live in this area. But Peng zhixian Zhixian is still silent, doing his own work every day, rarely interacting with people. Even if you meet the captain and deputy captain of the vegetable team Kaolin, he just nodded or laughed. He knows that the more pipes are, the more unlucky. \\nXiao Lian is also in the vegetable team. She lives alone. Although women are scarce here, there are few people going with her, and even few people talk to her. People from Xinjiang Daily News have seen her, and they all seem to be wanting to hide from her. The first criticism of Xinjiang Daily News Agency against the right was Yu Zhenwu. Yu Zhenwu read a lot of books. Knowledge was more optimized. It was the pen bar of the daily newspaper at that time, and the masses were also high. Only cadres above section level can listen to his report. He was beaten as an anti-party group because he did not agree with Editor-in-Chief Ronke. The group is fabricated, and the anti-party is even more incapable of talking Xiao Lian is implicated in the group. Xiao Lian is smart, good to learn, and Yu Zhenwu is somewhat ambiguous. Criticism of Yu Zhenwu, she went back at the meeting to expose the matter between the two people with Yu Zhenwu, and the words were overwhelmed. \\nRight hats are allowed to choose their own employment. Most of the Xinjiang daily newspapers have arranged work at the Tianlong Iron and Steel Factory. Yu Fei thought of his foreign language level and wanted to find a more suitable job. One day, Yu Fei came to Peng zhixian Zhixian's residence and said, 'Old Peng zhixian, can you lend me some money?' Pang said, 'How much do you want?' He said, '$40.' Peng zhixian said, 'OK!' Peng zhixian took him 40 yuan, and Yu Fei handed him two letters after receiving the money, saying, 'These two letters are left to you!' Peng zhixian Zhixian did not ask, 'Where are you going?', he just took the book and read it. It was two letters of twelve kinds of manuscript lithograph 'Qing Dynasty Notes Series', saying, 'OK!' Peng zhixian Zhixian thought, 'When you come back, I'll return the book to you again!' \\nYu Fei left Tianlong Iron and Steel Factory with luggage to Urumqi. Before he went to Beijing, he wrote a letter to Fuwen. Fuwen is the chief editor, president, deputy president of Xinjiang daily newspaper, deputy minister of propaganda department of the district party committee. Rich did not reply. Helpless, Yu Fei only went to Beijing to seek his own job. To Beijing, he went to Guo Moruo's home, Guo Mo is not present, Guo's wife Yu Liqun is, he is not good to say what. Yu Fei, looking at the strains at hand, thought of a student he met while studying in Kolkata, India, is now the first secretary of the Indian Embassy in China. Yu Fei arrived at the Indian embassy in China. By no means, the classmate was not there either. Yu Fei was handcuffed when he walked out of the embassy gate. 6\\nAfter the local arrangement of self-choosing employment by the right, a policy was put in place to resolve the separation of couples, saying that the right is also a person, and the couple cannot be separated for a long time. It is actually cleaning up the city's 'roads' so that the right wife also goes to the lower unit. Mengdu's wife Luo Green transferred to Tianlong Iron and Steel Factory to engage in finance. Wang Hongjia's wife worked at the district film company, and Tianlong Iron and Steel Works sent people to the film company, saying they wanted to solve the problem of their couple's permanent separation. His wife is the backbone of the business of the film company, and the film company firmly does not put it. People from the film company said, no, to bring Wang Hongjia back to Urumqi, we arrange. Tianlong iron and steel factory considered a bit, it was released. The culture and education of film companies and autonomous regions are a system, and it is not difficult to contact a teacher position. So, the film company was contacted. However, all secondary schools in Urumqi city were contacted again, saying they were missing teachers but were not willing to accept hat-picking right. No way, the film company contacted the small daiwopu farm in the outskirts of Urumqi and asked him to be a propaganda officer at the site office. \\nKaoling found one of the female workers who had been recruited from Jiangsu to get married, but the money on hand was not generous. He found Peng zhixian Zhixian. He said, 'Old Peng zhixian, can I lend me a little money? I'm getting married and returning you later!' Pang said, 'Well, how much do you want?' High says '400!' Pang gave him 400 out of his deposit. After Peng zhixian Zhixian became the right, the salary fell from level 18 to level 22. The salary of 22 is more than 70 yuan, the average person is 40 yuan. In addition, Peng zhixian Zhixian is still single. A person is not hungry to eat the whole family. He has no habit of drinking or smoking. The only hobby is to buy books and read books. On the Ganhezi Dagobi beach, 100 kilometers away from Urumqi, where can I go to buy a book? \\nYu Fei was handcuffed into the detention center. The court sentenced him to 15 years' imprisonment for 'conspiracy to treason' and sent to Beijing prison. At this time, his wife Mou Cui Zhen worked on Radio Xi'an with two children, and his life was difficult. Zhang Zhongzhi is ready to go to his mouth for a trip, want everyone to make some money to help her. \\nZhang Zhongzhi found Peng zhixian Zhixian, saying, 'Yu Fei is now caught up. He is serving a sentence. His wife's life with two children in Xi'an is very difficult. We don't even eat enough to eat. We are helping her ah!' \\nPang Zhixian listened after a burst of con He only knew that Yu Fei had gone, but did not know where to go, let alone the matter of the sentence, and said, 'OK!' Without any hesitation, he took out all the more than 100 yuan of money from his body and handed over to Zhang Zhongzhi. More than 100 yuan, equivalent to his two months' salary. In three years of disaster, he almost died of starvation. Although there are a few money on it, where can I buy something to eat? He wants to help. \\nAfter 15 years of sentencing, Yu Fei wrote a letter to his wife Mu Cuijin, saying, 'You don't wait for me,' and offered to break up with his wife. \\nAfter the fall of 1962, a group of right parties at the Tianlong Iron and Steel Factory had all placed jobs in different jobs. Only Peng zhixian Zhixian had not yet worked, and the District Party Committee decided to concentrate those people who did not work in Shanshan gardening grounds. Before leaving, Kaolin found Peng zhixian Zhixian and said, 'I don't have the cash right now, give you a few bonds!' \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian nodded his head. \\n8\\nAfter the National Day in 1962, more than 100 people from the Office of Human Resources of the Northern Xinjiang Region were gathered in Shanshan horticultural grounds. \\nThese 100 people, all kinds of people have, among them the right. \\nA horse, a student of the Central Conservatory of Music. The anti-right movement is over and he is not classified as the right. The leader spoke to him, saying that now the movement is over, all the things that should be drawn up, what do you have in the anti-right movement? Now you can also say to the party. Now to give heart to the party, it will not be pursued. He said there were some thoughts he had, but he didn't say it. Later the leader said that since you had that idea, you had to be classified as the right, so he added. After forming the right, he was devolved to Xinjiang. During his school at the Conservatory, he had talked about a contrast. He was divided into the right, and the object was blown. \\nThere is a young man of Jiangsu nationality called Zhu Han, who is 10 years younger than Peng zhixian Zhixian. He is a coal mine technician belonging to the Hami Mining Bureau. He is also concentrated here to rearrange his work. \\nThere were several girls in Shanshan Garden, and Zhu Han looked for an object to talk about. He said to Peng zhixian Zhixian, you also find a talk! Peng zhixian Zhixian said that I am in my 30s, people are still young, the age difference is so big. What do I do to touch that nail? Zhu said, 'Would I introduce you to one of my hometown? What did Peng zhixian say she did? Zhu Han said: Her name is Zhu Jinxiu. She is one of our Zhujia people, in the same village, very strong personality, love to learn better, is now a worker of Shandong Tancheng Machinery Factory. Peng zhixian said it could be, just if people would like to do it? Zhu Han said I was going to go home recently to visit my family and told you when I went back. Peng zhixian Zhixian promised. Although Peng zhixian Zhixian promised, he didn't hold too much hope in his heart. He knew that he was a big boss, and he was a hat-picking right. Does a young and well-educated young women's union run to Xinjiang to find a hat-picking right? \\nPeng zhixian Zhi Xianchoing calculates, himself has 35. The poor family situation in the school era, coupled with a few words, no female classmates were greeted. After graduation, she was assigned to the Propaganda Department of the Party Committee of Xinjiang, although there was a job and the work unit was very enviable, but the shortage of women in Xinjiang, coupled with the conversion of hundreds of thousands of large military forces, this situation is even worse. Wang Zhen's decision to recruit several batches of women into the country from Hunan, Shandong and other places, also differs too much from the coordinated proportion. In addition, there is no family running, and the anti-right movement trapped in a mud pit, making a talented youth an old single in marriage. \\nZhu Han returned home and told Zhu Jinxiu's mother about Peng zhixian Zhixian's mother. The mother had no opinion. He just promised to say to Zhu Jinxiu, saying, 'Her things are what she does.' Zhu Han Tan came back and told Peng zhixian Zhixian about the situation and told Zhu Jinxiu's address. \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian wrote a letter to Zhu Jinxiu, giving a brief introduction to his situation. \\nZhu Jinxiu, born in 1937 in rural Huai'an, Jiangsu, has four younger brothers. She was grandma with big hands. Grandma did not know what he always wanted to commit suicide after his grandfather died. She always followed her grandmother, and she was constantly alert even to sleep at night. Grandma died in 1953, she was going to school when she was 16 years old. As soon as she goes to school, she is going to grade 4. The principal got her to grade 3, and she didn't do it. She is going to grade 4. The principal said that you got 100 points for each exam, and she promised. So, she desperately learned from her classmates. In addition to arithmetic, all other subjects were 90 or more points or 100 points. After following a relative went to Tancheng County, Shandong, admitted to the technical school. Graduated from technical school in 1958, to Tancheng Hongqi Machinery Factory. Tancheng is a good place, not far from the Yellow Sea, aquatic rich, seafood every day, she feels life too good. What Zhu Jinxiu is thinking about learning, learning technology, learning culture, reading books and newspapers, and dreaming that one day he can write articles. \\nJust as Zhu Jinxiu was obsessed with learning technology and culture, she received a letter written by Peng zhixian Zhixian from Shanshan, a hometown of cantaloupe thousands of miles away. \\nZhu Jinxiu holding a letter from afar, reading, she appeared in front of her eyes a solitary wanderer, 5 years old bereaved his mother, his father went out somehow, his grandfather and grandma died, a man was studying abroad, working in the frontier and was beaten into the right, devolved labor several times in distress... how could he Are the bad guys? How could he be the right? No, no, sure he was wronged! Look at this letter so elegant, so literary, reading a letter is like reading an article in a newspaper. No, it's better than the article in the newspaper! ... Zhu Jinxiu thought about, a spicy, winning, loving learning girl's heart flew far away, she spread the paper to pick up a pen, wrote him the first letter. \\nHuang Hai Tianshan, a wide range of miles, the messenger of green clothed, pulled the two hearts closer. The two people sent photos each other. In the eyes of Zhu Jinxiu, age is no longer a problem. Peng zhixian Zhixian's writing and knowledge have conquered her heart. She more than once thought in her heart, how he wrote things so well, so there was a level, never wrote mess things, and could not see a word of love, even if you wrote an admirable heart, did not write directly, but used a few verses. Those poems have been engraved on Zhu Jinxiu's heart wall, 'I walked out of the east gate of the city, the girl is much like the clouds of heaven; although much like the clouds of heaven, they are not the people I miss...'\\nPang Zhixian planted cantaloupe in Shanshan gardening grounds. The work done is nothing more than moving to cut the earth trowel, partake cantaloupe seedlings, compared to mining coal at the Tianlong Iron and Steel Plant, building a house in the plant, and pushing iron slag in the iron making workshop, it is no longer a living. After receiving the work from the ground and eating, Peng zhixian Zhixian picked up the books of classical literature with him, or think about her far off the Yellow Sea coast, or look at her letter or write to her. Sometimes looking at her letter boast his words, there is also a little sweet feeling in the heart, or even laughing. Peng zhixian Zhixian knows that he is a scholar-type rigorous person, is not a romantic poet. The poems written to her are not their own poems, but 'out of the East Gate, there is a woman as a cloud; though it is a cloud, bandit I think.' Jump to your pen tip, inadvertently write it on paper with the current words. \\nIn early 1964, more than 100 people who worked in Shanshan horticultural grounds for more than a year came to their hearts 'Minister Chin Chin Chin'. The Office of Personnel of the Autonomous Region came up with an officer, bringing together everyone, saying that you are now assigned a job, followed by the distribution list on paper, and sends each person a check-in note. Assignment work is complete. \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian, Tu Jixue and Wang Degui were assigned to the Kashgar Office. Wang Zhi was divided into Wada further than Kashgar. Zhu Han divided into a coal mine as a technician. He thought coal mining was too dangerous and left the mine home. \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian took the check-in notice to find the car to Kashgar. \\n9\\nPeng zhixian Zhixian went into the Personnel Section of the Kashgar Administration and delivered the distribution notice form, saying, 'I came to report!' \\nCheng Mingying is looking at the documents issued above. \\nSeeing someone, she took the notice and asked him to sit down. Then remove a copy of the material from the drawer and say:\\n'Are you Peng zhixian Chi Hin, right?' \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian said, 'I am!' \\nShe said, 'Assign you to Gashi County, right? This was what we decided to meet!' \\nWhen Cheng Mingying said this sentence, there was no point of nail on the board, and seemed to have a negotiated tone. After Peng zhixian Zhixian listened, heart Ritton, hesitantly said, 'What do I do to Jiashi County?' Cheng Mingying said: 'You go to Jiashi County as a statistical cadre, do statistics work!' Peng zhixian Zhixian felt strange: 'I've never been a statistics!' Cheng Mingying looked at the table and said, 'That's what you wrote on this table!' Peng zhixian Zhixian thought, and said, 'Uh-I think of it!' \\nAfter removing the right-wing hat, Peng zhixian Zhixian was given preferential treatment to the side team to grow vegetables. At that time, the labor had been much lighter and there was no danger. At that time, a large number of people were drawn from Jiangsu to be divided into the vegetable land, everyone should work to remember the division of labor. How much work did you do, for ten minutes before finishing work, let Peng zhixian Zhixian use a wooden bow to measure the land, and dried a few acres and converted it into a division of labor. When personnel cadres of the iron and steel factory fill him out the form, they simply did not write what university they had ever attended before, and what work they had done, just said 'hat-picking the right' or 'statistics'. In fact, the 'statistics' are still high written, the staff is still far away from statistics! \\n'Uh, yeah, I stayed at the Tianlong Steel Factory, and I had planted more than a year before leaving. I was also a team of staff members. They probably think of the staff as statistics, right?' \\nCheng Mingying said, 'So what do you do? Reschedule you. What are you doing? What have you done in the past?' \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian said: 'He was an officer in the propaganda department of the district party committee!' \\n'Then you go to Gashi County Committee secretary!' \\n'Thank you for your kindness. But I'm not eligible! I'm not a party member, and a lot of documents are confidential.' \\n'Say yourself what you want!' \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian tentatively said: 'I am a secondary school teacher!' \\nCheng Mingying wants a graduate of the Chinese Department of Lanzhou University, a person who has worked in the propaganda department of the district party committee, to be a middle school teacher a little bit of the talent! She first considered the Kashgar Teachers College. However, the teacher training colleges are not administered by the Kashgar Board and are administered by the Department of Education. Cheng Mingying speaks while thinking about it. Pang Zhixian sat there without breath. But what he feels warm in his heart, has he ever heard such bargaining words since the reversal of the right? What is heard is accusations, orders, and cold words, not to mention the assignment of superiors to subordinate? His eyes are a little moist. He saw her gaze also contained a kind of wishful hope. \\nCheng Mingying again opened his mouth. \\nShe said: 'Now Kashgar teachers have recruited several college classes from Tianjin, mainly to learn dimensional language and also learn Chinese. Is there any difficulty for you to teach Chinese?' Peng zhixian Zhixian did not hesitate, saying: 'I have not been wasted in these years, my free time has been reading books, there is no difficulty!' Cheng Mingying said, 'That's good!' She then picked up a telephone call and consulted with an officer in the Education Section of the Department. That officer also agreed. \\nThus, Peng zhixian Zhixian went to the forum of the college department of Kashgar Normal School. \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian stood on the forum of the college department of Kashgar Normal School, and always thought of the scene reported by the personnel section of the Kashgar Administration, always thought of the personnel officer Cheng Mingying, who was warm and unequivocal. From then on, Cheng Mingying's name was engraved in his heart. A few months later, Peng zhixian Zhixian went to her again, but Cheng Mingying moved to Beijing with her husband. \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian stood up on the pulpit. How many years of knowledge accumulated in his belly had been pressed can be rewarded to society. In addition to his dedicated efforts to impart knowledge to the students, he also remembered Zhu Jinxiu of the Yellow Sea. He wrote a report to the school, asking the school to transfer Zhu Jinxiu to Xinjiang through the personnel department of the Kashgar Administration. \\nThe Kashgar Agency agreed that the Kashgar Bayi tractor repair plant is in need of a milling machine mechanic. So, a business letter was transferred to Shandong Tancheng Hongqi Machinery Factory. \\nZhu Jinxiu in Hongqi Machinery Factory is an active person, comprehensive technology, spicy character, and good. The County Women's Federation found this seedlings, believing that she has affinity and anyone can speak, especially suitable for the work of the Women's Union. The Women's Federation had greeted the factory, and the director and director of the women's federation also spoke to her. At that time the factory received a letter of business transfer. \\nIn 1964, the country was carrying out a vigorous boom of 'learning from Comrade Lei Feng', and everyone was struggling to do 'a revolution screw'. Since the organization asked to work in Xinjiang, and then there was a prince of white horse in mind there, let's go to Xinjiang to work. \\nZhu Jinxiu happily embarked on the train to the west. She pulled the windows noveliously looking outward, Zhongyuan land, eight hundred miles in Qinchuan, Hexi corridor, the more the view in front of the eyes is wrong; Gobi, desert, not hairy mountains, the more desolate. Hadn't arrived at Kashgar, her heart was cool half cut. The train arrived in Urumqi, and she thought that the train was temporarily parked on Gobi Beach and sat there. At that time the train just reached Urumqi, the station facilities were not built. Let's say it, this is the terminal! When everyone else finished, she walked off the train. I was catching up with the outbreak of Kashgar II disease (cholera). All vehicles were not allowed in. She stayed at the People's Hotel for three months, and took another seven or eight days in a car before she arrived in Kashgar. \\nZhu Jinxiu first arrived in Kashgar for a few days. She said, 'I'm going to investigate personally what Pang is? Right, I know. Political problems are caused by society, and I don't care about it. But what is his character? I have to ask.' Who to look for? Just ask their school and people close to them! \\nOne day, Zhu Jinxiu walked to Kashgar seed station not far from school and met a Han people. She felt very cordial when she saw the Han people. Zhu Jinxiu listens to his accent is a Henan man, and is a newly transferred agronomist from Shanshan Horticulture. She said, 'Well, you must know Peng zhixian Zhixian, who worked at the Shanshan horticultural grounds, how did the person think and style?' \\n'Oh, this man, I know, is a hat-picking right!' \\n'I know, I just wanted to ask this man how?' \\n'Hey, this man is good, very honest, not playboy. This person absolutely does not stick flowers and grass, see the female he is walking around!' \\nZhu Jinxiu also investigated several people, saying that Peng zhixian Zhixian, this person has a good heart and good character. That's why she went to the Bayi tractor repair plant. \\nKashgar in 1964 is still relatively backward. Although the few kilometers between Kashgar and Shule County are connected by simple road, there is no bus. Kashi agricultural machinery school, Bayi tractor repair plant, agricultural machinery factory and other units are scattered on the middle road side of the two places on the rural and desert beaches. \\nKashgar Normal School is close to the other direction of Kashgar city, to the Kashgar Bayi tractor repair factory also got to an hour. Once, Peng zhixian Zhixian came from Kashgar when it didn't shine. This made Zhu Jinxiu's heart a while warm. Sometimes after class, Peng zhixian Zhixian again rushed from the city to the factory, and the day was dark when they arrived. The two people said a while, the night was deep, and he had to rush back again. Zhu Jinxiu sent him out of the factory door. I really don't know how did he go back to the black Gulong Dong and a little potholed and uneven gravel? She was really worried about what's going on the road. \\nA female technical backbone in the factory, people grow so beautiful, caused a lot of ladies favor, some ladies also began to chase her. Factory director Hao Runhao said to her, Don't talk to that nerd. He is too honest. He is a hat-picking right, and you follow him will be guilty! I'll introduce you to a communist member, than he will come...\\nZhu Jinxiu listened to the words without saying. She admired Peng zhixian Zhixian's knowledge and writing. She also wanted to follow him to study writing well, and one day she could write such good articles. Second, she was also touched by Peng zhixian Zhixian's true love for her. \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian received a letter from Hetian. He opened a look, written by Wang Zhi, who was divided from Shanshan horticultural grounds to Hetian. The letter says, 'I'm ready to get married now, can you lend me hundreds of dollars? I borrowed my money to Wang Degui, I have no money.' At that time, Peng zhixian Zhixian remembered the other two people who had been assigned to Kashgar. Tu Jiyue was not the right, and was assigned to the Kashgar Daily. Wang Degui does not know which unit to manage finance. When Wang Degui was at the Shanshan Garden Garden, he took his wife and children. The salary was not very high. It was not surprising to borrow money. Peng zhixian Zhixian thought I was getting married now. What should I do? So he did not lend to Wang Zhi. \\nIn early 1965, the teacher training school gave a house, Peng zhixian Zhixian bought a little melon seeds, sugar, and nothing else. Peng zhixian Zhixian is still wearing that neat, broken clothes. In the evening, several teachers and leaders working in a piece of work came to Hexi, eat a sugar, do a handful of melon seeds, and everyone greet a few words. 38-year-old Peng zhixian Zhixian and 28-year-old Zhu Jinxiu completed a major event in their lives. \\n10\\nPeng zhixian Zhixian teaches ancient Chinese at the college department of Kashgar Normal School. \\nThe college department has enrolled four groups of students. The first batch was drawn from Tangshan, Hebei, and from Tianjin, Beijing, Nanjing and other places. Three years of study, with the year of graduation are called 66, 67 and 68. Each batch of three to five classes, each class to 50 individuals. The college class learns Vi language. It is to train Chinese teachers at Wyxu schools. Therefore, they also need to learn Chinese. Also recruit elementary school teacher classes. Their academic results are good, they are hard brushed down for various reasons during the college entrance examination, among which there are also jobs for a variety of reasons to move to the frontier. \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian taught two and a half years of modern Chinese lessons, and the first half of 1966 did not come to the summer, and the vigorous Cultural Revolution began. \\nShabby four old, seal repair, batch reactionary academic authority. Despite being a small city on the frontier, the fire of the Cultural Revolution quickly burned from Beijing. Principal Wang Xiongfei and the teaching director were pulled out, wearing a high hat and battered. At the same time the school also pulled out more than 20 teachers to accompany them. Everyone hung a big sign on his chest, saying some names such as 'walkers', 'historical counter-revolution', 'old right-wing', and so on, there is no problem, as long as the lesson you teach is four old, is also called out to fight. The batters were listed as three rows, and the first row was kneeling. On the kneeling is the principal Wang Xiongfei and the director of the faculty; the second and third rows are standing teachers. Black face with ink, hairdresser to geography Yin and Yang head. Regardless of men and women, holding the fader pushed from the middle of the head, the middle of the hair appeared a just pushed white slot, called 'Yin and Yang head'. Several women were also pushed into Yin and Yang heads, and their hearts looked like a knife crossed. Blood on the heart, no tears on the face. Peng zhixian Zhixian stood in the second row, and commanded the people who were queued as soon as they turned around, Peng zhixian Zhixian hided in the third row. It has not yet been his turn, and the Conference has begun. He fluke was not pushed into 'Yin and Yang head', but the face was painted with ink, chest 'right-wing' brand hung, became a god of cattle. \\nAfter the fighting meeting, the whole school atmosphere was tense, the critics had no place for themselves, and the majority of teachers and students were not obliged to draw out the boundaries with the teachers. Peng zhixian Zhixian's chest hung a sign of 'old-right elements'. Many familiar classmates, who have seen them far away, go away or bow their heads through him, as if they did not see. Pang Zhixian saw that the red guard backbone who presided over the meeting passed through his side, and discreetly a little bit of his head. The red guard backbone had a backbone's affinity against the past day, loud rebuked, 'You are honest!' Peng zhixian Zhixian scared his body, his heart 'gruffled' a bit. On that day he met Li Xiumin, a class 66 class three shifts, she did not escape, still walked through a smile, rubbing her body and gently called 'Teacher!' Pang Zhi Xian's heart Ritton swells a h"},

All college students know that Peng zhixian Zhixian has the largest collection of books in his family. One day, Peng zhixian Zhixian's home came to several red guards and posted a large print at his doorstep, restricting him to automatically clean up the problematic collection within three days. These students came to school late and never heard of Peng zhixian Zhixian's class. After they left, Peng zhixian Zhixian's brains: the books of the four books, the Zizi hundred families, and history of Chinese and foreign languages are not complete, but they are the consolation that he has bought over the years and migrated with him. Those books have been connected to his life, and all of them are like cutting off a piece of meat from his body. Want books or deadly? Want to come and go or life is precious. Peng zhixian Zhixian was only helplessly singled out some of the books that were retained in a small number of books such as Lu Xun. The next day, several students came again to Pang Chi Hsien's family, claiming to check his book collection. At a glance, Peng zhixian Zhixian is Wang Lai Yi, Tang Jie-Ying and Che Su who taught Class 66 class two classes. These students are excellent students in that class, and his heart is drumming: 'Will they be that ruthless?' Peng zhixian Zhixian showed them both books that had been divided into retention and awaiting seizure. They looked through it in focus, and then put a long note on several wooden boxes that they had already prepared with a Red Guard battalion seized one day, and finally put a circular on Peng zhixian's house: the book here was closed, no one else needed to come again. \\nSince then, no one has come again. Peng zhixian Zhixian understands that this move is the hard work and ingenious trick of these classmates. \\nFrom the fall of 1966 to the summer of 1967, this batch of cattle ghosts of Kashgar teachers was supervised labor, from harsh to loose for nearly a year. After that, the Cultural Revolution formed two major factions of revolutionary and conservative. The two factions by the big debate 'wendoo' have evolved into a 'weapons battle' for knives and guns. The city of Kashgar was occupied by the villain Red II division, and the surrounding countryside outside Kashgar city were conservative, conservatives from various counties and conservatives in the countryside around Kashgar, encircled the Kashi city regiment. Teachers school is not in the city, but on the edge of the city, only a circle of two meters high soil walls and farmland isolation, easy to defend in combat. The two major factions in the school have left school, or went to the city to participate in the Red II Division, or outside the city to participate in the siege of the Red Revolution Union. The villains of the Bayi tractor repair plant also came to the city. Peng zhixian Zhixian thought of the Bayi towing plant's wife's unit to go. He tried to walk past. The man who had back gun moat said, you better not to go. Although we don't put a gun, we don't put a gun in the fields around the fields. If someone put a cold gun, it's not a good deal! \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian think about it, it is not the previous one, a single, one hundred. Now, if 'in case', it is not my sin to leave my orphans and widows? So he returned again. \\nWhen both school students evacuated, the villains prevented the principal Wang Xiongfei from leaving the school one step, while the centrist Peng zhixian Zhixian could not go on either side, only to stay in the school. Looking at this scenario, Li Jingbo, class 66 class classmate, took the initiative, saying: 'Teacher Peng zhixian, I stay with you, eat and live with you and can keep in touch with the student headquarters in the city!' Of course, Peng zhixian Zhixian was happy. \\nLi Jingbo is a person from Hebei. He is a group of students from Tianjin. He was short, about one meter six, and his family was poor, and other classmates looked down on him. Peng zhixian Zhixian treats students regardless of whether they are rich or poor, regardless of their origin, whether they are tall and short, and are more polite to him. Li Jingbo's heart probably had this feeling, and only voluntarily volunteered to stay with Peng zhixian teacher. \\nLi Jingbo also said, 'Teacher Peng zhixian, I will not cook!' Peng zhixian Zhixian said: 'I will steamed, will roll out noodles, can cook it anyway!' That's what happened. As a result, the two men received a month's grain and oil ration at the student headquarters at the time of the evacuation: a bag of flour, a bottle of oil, a little salt, and a little radish and cabbage. A pair of teachers and students, day and night, pick up food for a while and watch some books. A large campus with only principal Wang Xiongfei, teacher Peng zhixian Zhixian and his student Li Jingbo. The principals and Peng zhixian Zhixian are about their age, and the two are afraid to move around each other. The campus is empty, desolate, and only the dense, sometimes sparse gunfire and occasional shambles break the campus's silence. \\nWhen the insurgents left, the food left to them was finished, they went to find wild vegetables themselves, and the flour was finished. Li Jingbo risked the danger of a cold gun stray bullet, and he needed a small half bag of flour into the city. Soon, Premier Zhou of the State Council gave instructions to withdraw the siege outside the city, the two-party confrontation ended over a month, and the countryside around Kashgar City and Kashgar could be unimpeded. \\nBefore and after the National Day in 1967, Peng zhixian Zhixian returned home. After spending ten days at home, he returned to the teacher training school. He thought that the salaries paid by the school could not be idle at the Bayi towing factory every day. So he returned to school and began reading Marxir's writings. Factory Director Hao Run-hao said to Zhu Jinxiu again: 'Look at you, you ask you not to follow him, you want to follow him! You see how guilty you followed him?' Zhu Jinxiu said: 'Do not say, follow him to suffer, I will!' Then ask him to say, Do not say, The girls are so big! \\nAfter the National Day of 1967, all graduated students were given wages and assigned work, starting with rural exercise before moving to work. Some people went back to their mouth after a while in Xinjiang. Before the establishment of the Commission in 1969 was more messy, wanting to go away, a lot away. Zhang Zhong'an in the class is excellent. The female class is an activist. She is assigned to Radio Kashgar as an announcer. Li Jingbo also assigned the job, and later returned to his homeland in Hebei. \\nThe daughter went to school. After the 'Resumption Revolution', Kashgar teachers began to recruit secondary teacher classes to train teachers in Wihan Elementary School. Peng zhixian Zhixian took classes at school. Zhu Jinxiu was busy in the workshop. Nobody cared for her daughter's study, and mathematics were tested to zero eggs. The teacher came home and said your daughter was going to regrade. Zhu Jinxiu said to stay. My daughter heard hurry, let her mother teach her every night. Zhu Jinxiu's mathematics could still be learned, and her daughter woke her up at three o'clock to let her teach. Zhu Jinxiu lying in the nest was on her body. Not long, the daughter's grades went up at once and became a Miyoshi student. Some people in the factory said that the right-wing daughter could not be a Sanhao student, but the teacher did not look so much, just felt strange, asked Zhu Jinxiu what method he used to teach her daughter. Zhu said her approach. They saw that she was a good teacher, and they pushed to the factory and wanted her to be a teacher. \\nZhu Jinxiu in the workshop is a versatile hand, car, milling,, grinding samples can be picked up, where the lack of people, let her top, the factory shouldn't put it. Zhu Jinxiu thought that I might better tune my old man, ah. He was stuck at school by three or two so-called villains who wanted to make contributions to please. It is not comfortable to transfer to teach primary school here? So she said to the factory leader:\\n'Can't I transfer my loved one? Why can't we do it for so long?' \\nThe leader said: 'Our three factories run school, we are about to factory a teacher, can the teacher school put him?' \\nZhu Jinxiu said: 'Do not let you care, as long as this side receives it!' \\n'Really?' \\n'Really!' \\nThe college class of Kashgar Normal School was suspended in 1968, and also recruited several middle teachers. By 1975, even the Chinese language teacher classes were not run, and they needed to run a Weisei language school. So as soon as they go, they release people. Three factory-run schools are primary and secondary schools, and Peng zhixian Zhixian Secondary School Language. \\nBeaten as the right, Peng zhixian Zhixian's heart has been disobedient. In 1971, he started another lengthy complaint. \\nIn the provisions of October 26, 1967, the CPC Central Committee on the issue of inadmissibility, rich, counterproductive, bad, and right flight cry at the same time stipulates: 'Individual cases of error really need to be screened, but also to be dealt with in the later stages of the campaign.' In September 1969, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee was established. Peng zhixian Zhixian believes that the Cultural Revolution is nearing its late stage, and the opportunity to appeal is indispensable. Plus, at that time, he had read Mao Zedong's book, read the 40 volumes of 'Lenin's Complete Series' and the published volumes of Marx Engels, and had read out the 'Peng zhixian Zhixian's Right-Party Words and Deeds' published by the Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee, which contained many of the falsehoods and falsehoods of words. As a result, on several occasions, he reproduced more than 10,000 words of complaint and sent to the Revolutionary Council of the Autonomous Region. In January 1972, he sat a car from Kashgar for a few days and came to Urumqi, risking the cold wind, stepping on ice and snow, two times to the Dongquan 57 Kan School in Hutubi, went to the school Lin Bemin, accusing the school student Cui Tiansheng, the author of 'Peng zhixian Zhixian Right Word and Deeds'. Of course, the accusation was inconclusive, but he suffered severe pneumonia from the cold cold on his way back to Kashgar. When he moved back to his home, he was immediately taken by his wife to the 12 hospital of the Southern Xinjiang Military Region, where he was treated in a timely manner. \\nHowever, Peng zhixian Zhixian's complaint was also a bit harvested. That is, when he traveled through Urumqi, he heard some of Cui Tiansheng's promotion doorways and news. Originally, Cui Tiansheng's father was a military unifying agent of the Kuomintang of the Baoji Railway Bureau. After liberation, Cui Tiansheng was able to join the army smoothly and quickly enter the Party Committee, and he was able to turn to the propaganda department of the Autonomous Region Party Committee. In the anti-right movement, he was promoted to the deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Party Committee of Xinjiang, due to the fight against the right. At that time, he greeted his father from his home Baoji in the district party committee, and also served as a policing committee, and people respected as 'Uncle'. The Cultural Revolution began, and his father's identity as an agent was revealed and committed suicide. Cui Tiansheng was a little lost favor at this time. \\nWhat makes Peng zhixian Zhixian impossible is that your father is an agent, whether it is true or false, history is not clear, why do you treat me so vigorously in the fight against the right? Do you want me to die? \\nIn 1974, Peng zhixian Zhixian wrote a plea of nearly 40,000 words, quoting Ma, column and Mao quotes, named 'Who was the bourgeois right in 1957 in the propaganda department of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Party Committee?' He found steel plate, wax paper and engraved more than 30 pages. Zhu Jinxiu came to the oil printing machine, and sent paper to the teacher of the agricultural machinery school. He pushed the drum of the oilprinting machine, Zhu Jinxiu turned over paper page by page, a total of 100 copies. Pagination, binding, envelope, affixed stamp, seal, write address. After that, it is constantly sent everywhere. One copy to send, a copy of the stone sunken sea. After the sea, Peng zhixian Zhixian still sent out a copy. \\nOn 1 July 1977, Peng zhixian Zhixian reduced 40,000 words of complaint material to two pages, one suing Cui Tiansheng and the other against Lin Bumin. To sue Lin Bumin, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Party Committee against the Right Time Zone, for bureaucracy, is not good to judge and make people who are not the right to be \\nThis time there was an echo. This echo is another severe frost for Peng zhixian Zhixian. \\nIn 1978, the letter approved by Yang Yong, party secretary of the autonomous region, was sent to the Bayi tractor repair factory by the Kashgar Administration: 'According to the current counter-revolutionary local batch processing!' Which hand is approved by this paper, no one knows. \\nYang Yun, director of the factory office, handed this approval to the party secretary of the factory. \\nWang Dehe, secretary of the party committee of the factory, looked at and said, 'He is not the central leader, and he still needs the approval of the leadership of the autonomous region?' And then said, 'Go to the fuck! Fucking a fart, what counter-revolution is not counter-revolutionary, where is there so many counter-revolutions? We don't care about him!' And he said to Yang Yun: 'As far as the two of us know, oh, no other people know!' \\nParty secretary Wang Dehe, participated in the revolution in 1938, Henan people. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, he was secretary of the county committee in Jiashi County. He was transferred from the troops to the place, and he was straight. He was in his 50s when he was battered and let him climb as a dog. \\nThe director of the plant did not let the factory director Hao Run proud to see, just let Zhu Jinxiu take a glance, and then stuck in the drawer. \\nA month later, the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party Central Committee gave the right to correct or rectify the wrong cases and all mistakes made in the past. Wang Dehe looked at the document and was angry: 'Mom got a fart, let me approve him a month ago, let me give him a month later?!' \\nIn February 1979, Peng zhixian Zhixian's right issue was corrected and party membership was restored. \\nIn the summer of 1981, Peng zhixian Zhixian, Zhu Jinxiu packed up and ready to return to Urumqi, Xinjiang Institute of Education to teach ancient Chinese. 'Now the right is turning the sky!' said one of the remembers of the army. Zhu Jinxiu said: 'The right turned the sky, you turned the sky too!' \\n11\\nIn August 1981, a truck pulled four people from the Peng zhixian Zhixian family and his tattered home to the door of the Xinjiang Institute of Education. \\nThe leaders involved led Peng zhixian Zhixian to a brick bungalow, pointing to a house far away and said, 'Our house here is tense. You first live here!' The leader said, turn away. Pang Zhixian, Zhu Jinxiu and sent their drivers to the house in front of the house. See windows broken, door open, roof light; house garbage, dirty socks, rotten shoes, scrap stuff, a urine smell comes, and a few heaps of waste. Zhu Jinxiu has seen just a stomach. The driver looked and said, 'This is not as good as your cows! Go, go, don't be here anymore. Luggage has not been unloaded, return to Kashgar! Peng zhixian Zhixian's face showed a kind of bitter, shake his head, think about it, when it comes to peace, the situation will slowly get better. Zhu Jinxiu borrowed a broom and dustpan from a family and began cleaning up. \\nFirst arrival, life sluggish, stove has not settled well. Zhu Jinxiu said we went to the school canteen to have a meal? Peng zhixian Zhixian said that it was a canteen for students, did you eat it? Without boiling water to drink, Peng zhixian Zhixian asked her to mention two pots to the old classmates of the District Party Committee. The school of education in the north gate, district party committee in the square, two stops away, walk a twenty minute walk. \\nThe classmate of Peng zhixian Zhixian is Hou Desheng, a people from Shaanxi, who do not love to speak. He was a major in accounting at Lanzhou University, and both of them took a car to the propaganda department. Against the right, he had nothing to do. Peng zhixian Zhixian became a right-wing devolved labor. Except for the books that were brought around, the rest of the books were placed in his house. Every time he returned to Urumqi, he also went to his home. Houderson moved home a lot of times, and the books also moved a lot of places with him. Peng zhixian Zhixian returned to Urumqi, which is also the beauty of Hudechen. Originally Peng zhixian Zhixian was preparing to go to Kashgar Normal College. Hou said you don't go there anymore. His son worked in OHRM and contacted the Faculty of Education. There is also an old student Wang Yuanqing, secretary of the Party Committee of Education Institute of Urumqi. Hou Desheng also asked him for help. Wang Yuanqing said that my temple here is too small, or go to the education college of the autonomous region. Wang Yuanqing also made a recommendation to the District College of Education. The right wing of Peng zhixian Zhixian corrected. It was supposed to have been back to the propaganda department. The Personnel Office of the Propaganda Department also called the District Education Institute: 'He is the wrong right, and the propaganda department is not coming back, you will arrange it!' \\nThe predecessor of Xinjiang Institute of education is the first teacher in Xinjiang Province. When the Xinjiang Normal University was established, a portion of the people and objects were dispatched, and the rest set up the Xinjiang Institute of Education on its original site. When Pang Zhixian moved into the College's Chinese Department, there were a shortage of ancient Chinese teachers. Several reasons prompted the College to accept Pang Chi Hsien. Originally, the Institute of Education did not want to accept: 'Leaders are radical revolutionary, afraid to arrange for a right to be said to be crooked in their ass!' \\nPang Zhixian came to the college for two days. On September 1, Peng zhixian Zhixian stood on the podium. \\nAt first, the college refused to keep Zhu Jinxiu easy, because Peng zhixian Zhixian insisted that he would leave people too. Exactly, he previously contacted Hunan Yueyang teacher who was willing to accept his couple and sent a letter to the Xinjiang Institute of Education. The College knew that Peng zhixian Zhixian wanted to go, and the policy of the Autonomous Region was that 'intellectuals can only move in, not pull out'. But still afraid to make things big, only reluctantly promised to arrange work for Zhu Jinxiu. At this time, the relevant cadres of the District Labor Department refused several times to transfer Zhu Jinxiu's personnel files to the District Education Institute. Thanks to the middle-level leadership of the district planning committee and Peng zhixian Zhixian's colleague Li Daren at the propaganda department of the District Party Committee took the initiative to coordinate the procedures. \\nThe College arranged Zhu Jinxiu as a handyman. Zhu Jinxiu doesn't want to do it or think, 'The original mechanic, now let me go to work as a handyman, clean up the toilet, live as a garbage station, I don't do it.' She found the hospital leader. The director of the hospital said: 'Can people live you can't live?' She said: 'The rest of the people in the transfer are all good houses, they all painted up a bit. Why don't we even pack up the house for us? Do not paint a bit? Do you see that everyone else has an official position, he has no office?!' \\nZhu Jinxiu also wanted to return to the factory in Shandong, and the factory also promised to let her go back. She also asked her friends and family in Nanjing, Huai'an and other places to contact several colleges. Schools also agreed to accept Peng zhixian Zhixian, but the policy of Xinjiang at that time was that they could only enter and exit. She thinks I can't leave my family back to Shandong or Jiangsu! Peng zhixian Zhixian is good. The right-wing problem has been corrected, as if the big mountain winds that weigh on him are not there. He is grateful for anything happy! But the fact is that the people of the Red Ocean brains do not have a deep understanding and reflection on those movements. \\nIt snows, outdoor temperatures below zero 20 degrees. House of more than 20 square meters, living for 4 people. Daughter is high one, son is the first, the fire is strong, but the firewall is not hot, especially the roof leakage, the roof is melting and snow dripping down by room temperature, adding to the chill and troubles. The frozen family was shrunk and returned to correctional prisoners than correctional prisoners. Although Zhu Jinxiu is a regular employee of the school, it is still less treated than some temporary workers. All sorts of uncertainties have made her a little nervous: 'When he was old right, I have not suffered this sin. Now his right is corrected, but I have suffered this sin!' She couldn't make sense. For several nights, she wanted to commit suicide...\\nIn 1981, after Peng zhixian Zhixian moved from Kashgar to Urumqi, he met on the street once the former Central Conservatory of Music that was named Ma. He said he was married and his wife was a vegetable company. \\nIn 1985, Peng zhixian Zhixian went to Zhejiang on a business trip, visited Yu Fei once. Before he departed to Jiang, Yu Fei went to see him again. \\nYu Fei sentenced to 15 years in prison for 'conspiracy to treason', first sent to Beijing prison and then sent to Zhejiang to serve his sentence. He served his sentence in a prison with Peking University's most famous female right-wing, Lin Xiling, but they didn't know it. Yu Fei's right-wing corrected, but the 15-year crime of 'plotting treason' has not yet been wronged. Yu Fei complaint, Beijing came to find Yu Fei in 1981. At that time, Yu Fei learned that Lin Xiling and him were in a jail. Yu Fei said he did go to the Indian embassy, and the person he was looking for is indeed not. The conclusion says that 'there is no evidence of treason after investigation, but according to logic, the right is bound to be treason and result in a misjudgment...'\\nAt the beginning of 1980, Peng zhixian Zhixian's first academic paper, 'A Brief on Jia Tian Chun's Economic Reform', was published in the fifth series of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences magazine Literary Review Series, followed by academic papers published in various newspapers. The Department of Scientific Research prepared the 'Catalogue of Scientific Research Achievements of Xinjiang Institute of Education' (1978.3-1991.3). Chen Bingwen, head of the department, informed the Chinese faculty of the current and retired faculty to report to publish a paper catalogue. Pang Zhixian reported 29 articles. When the Catalogue of Scientific Research Results was printed out, Peng zhixian Zhixian had only seven articles in the Journal of Xinjiang Institute of Education and the Journal of Ningxia Institute of Education. In addition, more than 20 entries in national journals and published in the Xinjiang Daily did not know which hand was cut off! The article published in Ningxia was probably saved because he had rated the first prize in his hospital. \\nIn 1984, Xinjiang Institute of Education awarded title, the college did not tell Peng zhixian Zhixian. Pang Zhixian, who is inclined to teach his head, pursue academic research, and not ask him about anything else, did not know that he had evaluated the title at the college. In 1987, when the College assessed the title, Pang applied directly to associate professor. When the professor was assessed in 1990, the Xinjiang Institute of Education said that he was older than the rated age. \\nIn 1991, Peng zhixian Zhixian moved to Room 302, Unit 4, Building 9, Family College of Xinjiang Institute of Education. House construction area of more than 70 square meters, utility area of more than 50 square meters. Four-unit 302 room against the gable, winter than the middle of the bedroom by cold air. The opposite door of his family lives a head of finance of the Xinjiang Education Commission. The roof of the entire building was prefabricated cement board, while the house of the financial leader of the Education Commission was mixed with reinforced cement from the first floor to the third floor where he lived. Heating hot water pipes also enter from his home, which also has more radiators than others. Peng zhixian Zhixian just moved into a few years, the temperature of the house can also, and later the heating pipe aging, the decoration of others and increase the radiator, directly affecting his home. Others house more than 20 degrees in winter, his house only 6 degrees, by the winter of 2009, its north side housing and kitchen, toilet temperature at the lowest close to zero degrees. Zhu Jinxiu reflected to the College Logistics Department, which has not been resolved. Peng zhixian Zhixian was high and weak and not cold, and had to rent housing in Hainan for the winter in 2010. Zhu Jinxiu constantly reflects that during the 2011 National Day, the problem of heating pipes is not easy to solve. \\nHousing conditions at the Xinjiang Institute of Education have improved in the past few years. They also covered more than 100 square meters of upper floors. The initial conditions were determined to be double workers and associate professors. A list was sent down, Peng zhixian Zhixian ranked third, but when he finally moved to the key, but there was no Peng zhixian Zhixian. \\nThe newly transferred people from the outside have lived on top floors, while Peng zhixian Zhixian, who has been working at the Xinjiang Institute of Education for 30 years, has no connection with high-rise buildings. When Zhu Jinxiu spoke to someone, the man said to her, 'Don't you understand? You don't give it-' she twisted with two fingers and wiped it on her mouth with her hands. Twisted hands mean not giving money; wipe your hands on your mouth, it means that you will not ask them to eat a meal. After that, then the two finger movements are:\\n'Why are they giving you!' \\n12\\nAfter graduating from the Chinese Department of Lanzhou University, Peng zhixian Zhixian has a unique experience of classical Chinese literature, whether it is a rural investigation or an adversity. Especially when he stood on the ancient Chinese pulpit, he was addicted to it. In the autumn of 1990, cousin Peng zhixian Zhiqi sent a letter from Hunan, ordering him to pay attention to the Tang dynasty female poet fish. \\nPeng zhixian Zhiqi graduated from North Western Language Department with wide knowledge, not only loves classical Chinese literature, but also Western literature. A few words in a letter lit up a light in front of Pang's eyes. Although Peng zhixian Zhixian has been buried in ancient Chinese and classical literature for decades, his knowledge of fish mystery and its poems is not deep. At that time, he paid attention to the poems of fish mystery and her life, only began to study the fish mystery poems in depth. Pang Zhixian's collection contains almost complete research materials such as Quan Tang Poems, 'Quan Tang' and 'Grand View of the Pacific'. Only individual materials can be borrowed from the library. Given that the fish is a woman, a female researcher can understand the poet's psychology, he sought a colleague of language scholar Zhang Yi to cooperate. \\nThey spent two years, after repeated modifications, and finally completed the chronicle, annotations and translations of fish mystery poems by the fall of 1993, and finally written in the preamble. The preamble focuses on the life of fish mystery, poetry commentary, and the author's own research methods. In the meantime, Peng zhixian Zhixian also examined the life of the friendly life of Wen Tingjun and Li Yun, etc., and wrote a paper on 'Wen Tingjun has not been rectified and related issues' in order to confirm that the chronology of fish mystery poems is accurate. The paper was published in Literary Heritage, No. 5, 1993, of the Institute of Literature of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. \\nHe notes and interprets the fish mystery poems based on two points, one is that the woman living in China's feudal society, dares to ignore the shackles of feudal ritual shackles, write such bold and warm words psalms, which is a must; second, like a fish mystery poem such as dozens of poems with the historical nature of personal love life Group, a continuous pearl, synthetic story, is rare in the history of ancient Chinese literature. \\nThe author's study of fish mystery begins with the interpretation of each of her poems. That is, starting with the language, and using the 'Green Alice' written by Tang Su-huangfu and the five generations of Sun Guangxian written 'fish mystery' as a reference to obtain the most credible information. In general, the poems of fish mystery are well understood, but some of these verses are quite 'classical'. She also often uses metaphors, substitutes, pun and other rhetoric, which makes it more difficult to read them. In addition to identifying the provenance of the analogy, the study also examines whether the words in the poems have meaning. Be sure to do words to understand, clear sentences, apt. On this basis, find the exact psalm part of the writing time, as a fixed point on the time ruler, and then insert the rest of the poems according to the inevitable link between the contents of the psalms, so as to complete the chronicle of fish mystery poetry. \\nThe author believes that the life of fish mystery, there are two biographies of 'Green Alice' and 'Fish Mystery', there is a big contour. But the text of the Emperor Fu, because it is basically the contemporary writing of contemporary things, it is inevitable that there are a number of obscure and twisting places in the text, there are some omissions. Sun Wen made one or two additions to the text of Huang Fu. It is good for future people to understand the fish mystery, but he removed all the suspicious points in the story of the Phu's description of the fish mystery murder case, and it was inconvenient to change the suspect case into an iron ca"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "se. In the future, most of the people who passed for the fish mystery were ancestral men. The poem of fish mystery is more important than the two biographies mentioned above, but it has not been really studied in depth for more than a thousand years, so many issues have always been blurred. Some people grabbed a sentence or two words in the poem, light down judgment, Dafabet discussion, throwing dirt on the female poet. Can be said to be 'lost in millennia, poor thousands of miles'. \\nAn accomplished female poet, a difficult situation in his life, early death, continued to be misunderstood for more than a thousand years after death, still unavoidably filthy. It's a little too unfair. \\nMore than a thousand years later, Mr. Tan Zhengbi, a researcher of modern classical literature, came out to question and speculate that the green hike was killed by the street pawns and buried in the backyard of the fish mystery; the fish mystery is likely to be subdued, and her confession is fabricated by an ad litem officer. Before Tan Zhengbi, there was no doubt that no one suspected fish was killed, but it was not as clear as Mr. Tan said. For example, Huang Fu is already stated in the 'Green Alice' that before the fish jail, a street pawker hated her deeply, and after conviction, there was 'Haji more as a spokesman'. And Huang Fu also wrote down the fish mystery in prison verses: 'The moon shines the spectre, the wind open short placket'. It seems to say that in the dark prison, she wants more light to illuminate her, and she also wants a gust of wind to blow her heart away to the world. It's not like the verse of a guilty person, but much like a grievous person who gives guessings when he has no right to speak the truth. In the future, people who made the fish mystery, such as Song Ruan Yue in 'Poetry Total Turtle', Yuan Xin Wenfang in the 'Tang Cai Zibiography', Ming people Xu Xianzhong in 'Tang Poetry', do not mention how the fish mystery died. By intentionally failing to mention her guilt, her guilt is not accepted. \\nIn the summary of his life written to the fish mystery, all those not found in the biography made by the former are based on fish mystery verses. Among the fish mystery marry Li Yi is a foreign wife nature; fish mystery only once, that is, from Changan to Jingzhou; fish mystery is their own choice to be a priest, not by others 'dedicate to the salty'; the fish mystery went home after the 'Hao man' was called 'Hao Xia' is the river east festival make Liu Tong; fish mystery and The relationship between Wen Tingjun and Li Yi is only a friend relationship, and there is no ambiguous matter; the fish is in less than two years of time, In the 'Merry' has selected Shanxi people left field as lovers, it is very likely to restore the worldly couple life; her marriage road is relatively twisty, but can not say what a disgraceful woman, these seven points are the new discovery of the author of the fish mystery poems compilation. It is on the basis of figuring out the above points, the author wrote a summary of the life of the fish mystery, but also to give the fish mystery poetry chronicle. \\nFinally, the author also put the poem of fish mystery in the women's poems of thousands of years, that is, the CKC comparison, and reference to the comments of the previous man on the fish mystery poems, the understanding of the value of fish mystery poems has been more reliable conclusions. \\nThe study of fish mystery includes Peng zhixian Zhixian's dipping dedication to classical literature for decades, and more he does not believe that 'influenced by the old Zhuang Thought quite deeply, the ideas on the development of things conform to nature, do not have to force manpower.' It can be said that the 'fish mystery poetry compilation notes' a book, for the fish Xuan machine washed a thousand and white grievances, great! \\nHowever, the humble and good Peng zhixian Zhixian faced with his research results, it was always thin, too weak enough to say that it was a booklet. \\nMr. Luo Shaowen 8 old said, you don't think about your book, 'All Tang Poems' fish collection mystery of the two words missing in the poem of 'Conversation Master', since Tang drop many poets in thousands of years have not filled up, and you put it up. These two words are better than some people's 1 million words, even a few million words! If you did not make up these two words, this person can read smoothly 'Xia color cut for clothing, Tim fragrant embroidery. Hibiscus flower leaves [secret], landscape [skirt] dilute. Resident post Yingling, open cage crane fly. Gao Tang spring sleep, twilight rain is flying.' Besides, the 'preamble' to turn the case for the fish is not everyone can 'turn over'. Even if it is the dirty water spilled on the fish, it doesn't everyone have that question the mind?! \\nLuo Shaowen's words are true. \\nIn 1993, 'fish mystery poetry compilation notes' was completed, to the Chinese Book Bureau. It was not accepted by having printed another fish mystery book. It has to be published in Xinjiang University Press. In 1995, 1,000 copies were printed for the first time and 600 copies were reprinted in 2006. On both occasions, the printed books were not retail in the bookstore, but were distributed to the National Library and the national key university libraries. The book is limited in print, its narrow distribution, the lack of wide readership and its impact, so far there are still some people in society, blind and ignorant, to the respectable Tang Dynasty poet fish mystery trampled arbitrarily and spilled dirty water. This cannot but be said to be a great regret for the reader group and to the author of the book. \\nOf course, those who poured dirty water on the body of the fish, with their own kindness and wickedness, poetry Jay, in addition to getting some humiliating grace, but also carved the shame on their faces. \\nHowever, there are also knowledgeable people. Wang Shaoliang and Wang Rong, Ph.D of Literature from Fudan University, said in 'The Fangsoul is Knowing Yan Open-After Reading': 'This is a new academic book with novel insights, rigorous examination and well-explained. The book in the study of fish mystery life deeds, chronicles and poetry interpretation, are rich in new ideas that reflect important academic value. At the same time, the book will be annotated, analyzed and pushed to the reader for the first time, so that it becomes an academic and appreciative academic research Books and Literature Appreciate Reading. From the chapter institutional point of view, this small book with only 110,000 words is not very large, but the small book is not small, it will not only show the dust-sealed fish mystery poems from the clouds from the fog, to collate the ancient cultural heritage of our country, it should also be worth our attention is that the book reflects the fish over the years The latest results of the mystery research have high academic significance.' (Guangming Daily, 29 March 1997)\\nThere is also a poem by Liu Zhenhan, an old scholar, published in the 4th Issue of 'Hunan Poetry' in 1996. Its poems say:\\nThousand Junshen in the Millennium Iron Case, only the woman is wronged until now \\nUnderground as a new song beauty, love poems this day meet the sound. \\nPoetry fell four parties mourning, the bell and drums won't hesitate. \\nWild Goose Pagoda is well deserved, the wonders and snow in the wheel. \\nPeng zhixian Zhixian looked at Liu Zhenhan's poem. Like he met a novelty, the night could not be coveted, and said:\\nPoetry can be hooked, not alone poetry of ancient and present. \\nThe penitentiary sentence, the enemy soul spits the strongest tone. \\nGrievous, old and present, the situation is a boudoir splendid! \\nWish to die in no way, good poems will be broadcast on the rooftop. \\nPang Zhixian has cleaned up the millennial grievances on the fish, and the problems of the Pang Zhixian right-wing elements have long been corrected, but have the hearts of those who have created the grievances and discriminated against and suppressed him face up to their hearts? Can human grievances not happen again until those grievances in the mind are cleared? ... But Peng zhixian Zhixian is still looking forward to: 'May I have to die in no way, good poems are broadcast on the roof.' \\n[Note]\\n1.

Takaoyuan president called Peng zhiyu Zhiyu, Shandong Ye County (now changed to Laizhou), people, face clear, long body, wearing a half-old tunic all day, is always a trance, relentless beaten look. In 1959, when I was in the fifth grade of elementary school, President Peng zhiyu was no longer a principal and taught us fine arts. \\nOn that day, Teacher Peng zhiyu gave us the first art class. The bell rang, only saw a middle-aged man in his forties entered the classroom, did not go to the podium, reach out to pick up chalk, and fluently wrote 'Peng zhiyu Zhiyu' on the blackboard. Writing very beautiful, when writing, frayed holes on the cuffs are exposed. Then he turned around and introduced me and said, 'This is my name, and I will give you a fine arts class later.' We are teenage children in the classroom, but we have learned from adults that President Peng zhiyu, known as 'lost soul', knew his identity as 'hat-picking right', and knew that he was a good man who had been wronged, and some were mixed with sympathy in respect. Teacher Peng zhiyu began to give us lectures, lectures on lines, graphics, paintings. The sound was not high, but it was clear. Although he has a heavy heart, not to mention his spirit, always squinting his eyes, rarely see classmates, but he has a clear mind about the class status of the classmates. Once found someone has a wrong expression, he knew that he did not understand, he immediately went back to repeat the key, until everyone understood it. He painted the birds, birds and fish, although a few strokes, but live and live, let us stunned. When we practice, he sat next to the lecture table and snooze, woke up by the student's noisy noise, but only gently opened his eyes to look down, and he immediately calmed down in the classroom, so he went on to nap, watching his head soon knocked to the lecture, it turned out to make the ghosts slowly rise Come, but just stay for a moment, and then slowly sink-after being beaten as 'right', Teacher Peng zhiyu is like under a frost Like the flowers and grass, too. \\nTeacher Peng zhiyu gave us only a few months of class, and he was gone and heard that it was 'running'-our family called blind flow that year-took the whole family into the guandong. As for the reasons, one argument is that the wife and children have no way to go hungry; one is that they have been expelled from public office and forced to Liangshan. Exactly why, I don't know so far. But I believe that this is his helpless. You think, he's a low-eye-catching cultural person who can not pick his shoulder, can not be mentioned, how can he willingly go to the old forest in the northeast deep mountains to work hard? Blind flows were very disgraceful in that year and were often 'repatriated' back. Remember Zhang Xingsheng teacher in the early hours, a young young man who was hungry and 'ran', but soon came back from Guan, said that there were too many people to run there, and the suffering there was not people. However, Teacher Peng zhiyu did not come back and never heard. It was until the 80s of the last century after the 'hat-picking right' was completely corrected, teacher Peng zhiyu's family returned to Ye County. However, it had long been wrong and people had become old. \\nI guess that the key reason why Mr. Peng zhiyu would rather suffer in the Northeast and not come back is 'face'. Intellectuals have to face. What is the Right? Together with landlords, rich farmers, reactionaries, and bad elements, collectively referred to as 'the right of the land rich and bad', were class enemies and controlled dictatorships at the time. And the so-called 'hat-picking right', in fact, has also been scored into another book. I don't say that even children and relatives are implicated, and cannot raise their heads in society for a long time. \\nI heard that Teacher Peng zhiyu was a 'alternate right', because at that time the county did not complete the right-wing target given above, President Peng zhiyu, who was loyal and honest, was filled up."}

'Shen Bingqiang in Shaoguan has moved from the left to the far right, and Peng zhongying in Zhanjiang has also changed from the left to the right, and Zhou Zheng in Hainan has been lowered from the left to the Chinese. Both Shen Bingqiang and Peng zhongying wanted to remove deputy commissioners. Zhou Zheng's position as deputy director of the Hainan Administration can be considered again.

There are four right-wing elements, one suspected and one center-right. 4 dead, 2 not dead. Similar events occur on all other systems. Tao Zhu said at the 6th meeting of the Provincial People's Congress that at present it is necessary to use the greatest vigour to carry out the anti-right struggle. It is in August and September, the struggle has spread rapidly into the CPC. Its fierce modus sportsmanship, its brutal methods of struggle must not be inferior to the fight against the right.

Resume\\nPeng zigang, female, Beijing (from Suzhou), is 44 years old. Bourgeois of family origin, my constituent student, joined the Communist Party of China in August 1938. 1954 Tone Traveler Magazine as Editor-in-Chief. Administrative level 11. \\nSecond, the main right-wing words and deeds\\n(1), Peng zigang is a pioneer of a vicious attack on the party and the people's government by right-wing elements using the 'left leaf incident'. She wrote an editorial entitled 'Respect for the Journalists' for Wen Wei Po, based on reports by Liu Guanghua, a right-wing activist in Wenhui, to curse the party's leadership in journalism. In her editorial, she said: 'Believing journalists have a tradition in our country. Unfortunately, this mantle has been spread to the present day.' The slander of the people's power is still 'to see journalists as hate people, guard against rather than cooperation, despair rather than respect, and all kinds of old styles still exist.' thereby provoking the media's dissatisfaction with the party. And shouted: 'We can follow a law that when a regime is against the people, it excludes journalists and suspects journalists.' She openly called: 'It's also time for journalists to be uneven.' To incite the press to rise up opposition parties and the people's government. \\n(2), During the opening period, Peng zigang wrote a large number of articles, attacking the socialist journalism cause and touting the tradition of old bourgeois newspapers. She believes that the post-liberation press cause is 'winning with measure' and 'burying talent', 'unable to play the journalist's journalistic sensitivity and creativity,' and that the leader comrades of the Party newspaper are 'people who do not know what they are doing.' She denies today's reporter's work, saying that the reporters are 'not interested' in the work, 'the quality of the manuscript is not of high quality', 'I don't see the reporter's God pen and eye.' She portrayed the post-liberation journalism as bad and no merit. But he praised the old bourgeoisie tradition. She preached the tradition of the Old Grand Communiqué as 'diligence and efficiency', boasting the 'spirit of independent thinking' of the reporters of the Old Grand Communiqué; described the reactionary literary politician and the boss of the Old Grand Communiqué as 'let go of trust in reporters', 'what does not often tell reporters' very respectful of the reporter's 'independent combat ability', pioneering The saints and sages of the World of Freedom. She therefore believes that the press is now not free and advocates free access to newspapers and interviews. Oppose the news submission system and advocate for reporters to 'think independently', 'hate the times and cons' and 'expose the dark side'. He also advocated 'free association' by 'several like-minded people' to run 'co-workers newspapers' or 'co-people publications'. The aim is not to lead newspapers and publications by the party. \\n(3), Because Peng zigang struggled the tradition of old bourgeois newspapers and is deeply dissatisfied with the socialist journalism cause led by the Party. Therefore, at the time of the attack by right-wing elements, she took an active part in the Jangluo League directing the press right to attack the party. She has actively helped store Ping to tamper with the political direction of the Guangming Daily and participated in the 'editorial advisory group' designed by Chu Anping. She suggested that the Guangming Daily, from the perspective of the Democratic Party Supervision Party, reported prices, daily supplies difficulties, housewives queued to buy food and other news, reflecting the 'small people' The resentment of the people's dissatisfaction with the Party. She has offered her advice to Chuanping on a series of activities such as the arrangement of key figures inside the Guangming Daily, crowding out Communist Party members and reusing right-wing elements. At the same time, she also participated in the conspiracy to revive the old Great Communiqué, including Zhu Qiping, Xiao Li and Xiao Feng, the right-wing elements of the Tabao commune. \\n(4), On June 8, after the publication of the editorial and article criticizing the 'Party World' in the People's Daily, 'This Is Why' and the article criticizing the 'Party World', Peng zigang and the right-wing elements Puxiu Xixiu, Fei Xiaotong, Xu Ying and other secret assembled in her home and Fei Xiaotong family to plan a counter-fight against the party. On the one hand, she tried to support Pu Xi Xiufa Chu Anping's resignation as chief editor of the Guangming Daily; on the one hand, the secret merchants should write articles to counter the People's Daily, as an unfair hold. She also made a curator for Wang Tieya to write an article refuting the People's Daily. And he ran around for the defense of Zhu Anping, saying that the statement stored in the United Front War Department (attacking the party's speech), was humor. The Chinese did not understand humor like foreigners, so a criticism of the leader would be great sin. \\n(5), Attacks on the leadership of the Party, defaming the Party's cadre policy and anti-opposition movements. Peng zigang, published on June 4, 'The Internal Contradictions of Our Company' wall newspaper, sweeping the fallacy that 'laymen can not lead the insider', attacking the leadership of the Central Committee of the Regiment. The central leadership of the press is 'a gust of wind' and 'to engage in cultural causes by engaging in a youth movement'. She believes that the Mission's central publishing house is the result of the past 'dogmatic hard-moving Soviet experience.' 'It is too high to ask the Central Committee to lead a good publishing house', because 'the regiment central government cannot lead the work of the Chinese Youth Publishing House', so, 'both in the policy of the publishing house and in personnel policy is distorted', it is not consistent with the law of cultural work. \\nHer policy of stigmatizing the party's cadre is to 'detain political conditions without asking for business conditions', thus 'creating a vicious circle of political and business division.' Her policy of slandering the party's unified allocation of cadres is just as unreasonable as what the ancients called 'study to foster children and marry later. ' She thinks that we 'don't know the characteristics of intellectuals,' stigmatizing us to see intellectuals as 'old', 'old', 'backward,' and 'educating young people with a crooked wind,' calling them 'despise and suspect old intellectuals.' He said that the publishing house's sectarianism is very strong. Li Geng's walk is extruded by sectarianism, and that Li Geng is unbalanced everywhere. \\n(vi), Her opposition party's socialist transformation of private business and industry. 'I believe that the enlightened bookstore will recover,' she said, 'I believe the enlightened bookstore will be restored.' She attacked the cooperation of the vegetable industry. She believed that the cooperation in the vegetable industry caused people to line up, caused distress, advocated the abolition of the vegetable company. She denied the improvement of people's lives after liberation, saying that today's children were mostly 'weak and inspiritless' and could not even eat pickles. \\n(vii), The use of authority to tamper the direction of the 'traveller' and plant poisons, causing many political accidents. Peng zigang has tried more than once to get rid of the party's leadership of Traveler's magazine in order to achieve his colleague magazine purpose. In the editorial department, crackdown on party members and the right-wing authors were pulled out of the Traveller magazine for a period of time, with casual and politically reactionary articles constantly appearing. According to a preliminary examination by Traveler's magazine, many right-wing articles were written by Peng zigang personally. Many of these articles are problematic. \\nIII. History and performance\\nThe materials revealed from this struggle prove that Peng zigang was a bourgeois right in the democratic revolution, who did many anti-party anti-people things. When Chairman Mao went to Chongqing for peace talks in 1945, Chairman Mao spoke at a rally in the women's circles. Chairman Mao repeatedly ordered not to be published publicly, but Peng zigang, a member of the Communist Party, actually published the news of Chairman Mao's talk in the Great Communiqué the next day, leaving my party passive. While she was a reporter in the Grand Gazette, she wrote a lot of articles that stigmatize the Party, stigmatize the Eighth Route Army, and stigmatize the progressive people, while lauding to the Kuomintang. She described Chongqing, the anti-Communist base camp, as a 'beacon of East Asia', Chiang Kai-shek as 'a youth sky,' and Sturelden as 'a peaceful old man who loves China and loves the United States.' After liberation, the party decided that she went to work in Tianjin 'Grand Communiqué'. She resisted and told people several times that she did not want to be a member of the Communist Party. To lose the organizational relationship for 2 years. Thus, although Peng zigang has covered the coat of 20 years of Communist Party members, the bourgeois thoughts, positions and opinions deep in her soul have not been reformed in any way, but they have intensified their development. So as the socialist revolution further deepened, he was revealed and finally fallen into the far right attacking the party. \\nIV. Attitude and treatment of errors\\nSince the beginning of the anti-Peng zigang right-wing rhetoric and deeds, there have been more than 30 meetings held within and outside the company. Peng zigang has been refusing to admit, shamelessly sweeping, outrageous attitude, hijacking purses to withdraw. When it is impossible to deny a large number of facts, then avoid weight, pretending to be confused, refusing to go to work and continue to inspect accounts by means such as resignation, returning home to Suzhou as a housewife and other means, there is no indication of willingness to re-work. Until today, attempts are still being made to turn the case. Attitude is extremely dead and hard. Therefore, we propose to dismiss party membership and administratively impose a retention inspection sanction for the removal of previous posts.

At that time faced the choice of future artistic direction. Thought of the comic book, at hand, 'my uncle Yulle' into 24 scripts, cut a sketch paper, with a plastic core pen with two days, want to send 'picture book' try, friend Ding Cong (famous cartoonist), and Cao Xin Zhi (framing artist, poetry (People), After knowing, help me write a short letter, saying it is now Xing this set. So with a recommendation letter and manuscript went to the 'pictorial book',Remember that Faisson went downstairs to meet me,He read the painting left,Recommendation letter did not want,Say 'no need.' It was then published in the 8th edition of the Illustrated Book, 1980. \\nThis is a must-have, acquaintances know that I'm still alive, the publishing house knows that I can still draw, from this time. Following the publication of the second set of 'A Newspaper', I also asked me to paint Homer's Epic 'The Story of Iriat'. Four painters were asked at that time, in four sequences, and I ranked second. Gao Yan, the first paragraph, was sick, and the pictorial asked me to 'save the field' and rushed out again, published in the 5th and 6th issues of 1981. Later Mr. Xu Ganlao added a lot of space for me, and went out of the upper and lower episodes of a single book. This draft was selected for the National Art Exhibition. \\nI draw comic books are selective. After the 'Cultural Revolution', you can instil nutrition in the world's literary treasures through comic books to young people, so only draw world famous articles, favorite Wu Zhaoxiu presided over the 'long short painting' column. For example: Bernard Shaw's Career and Social Pillars, and Dickens's Two Cities. A number of mid and long comic books were also painted, such as: (Russian), Tolstoy 'Resurrection', Balzac, Oyeni Grandai, The Three Musketeers, Charlotte Bronte 'Jane Love', Greek mythology 'The Adventures of Argo Heroes, (Italy), Bucachu 'Ten days talk', 'God lamp', 'princess's coat', 'Alibaba and Forty Thieves'. There are also Bible Stories, If Tomorrow Comes, and so on. And from 84 years of 'In One Hour' and later 'Silver Facebook', we started exploring many pages of new comic book forms. Enriching a long literary work into a fine comic book, is a kind of thoughtful and powerful creative enjoyment. \\nSoon, comrades Zhang Luo diao I entered the 'pictorial book' when editing, but it was not smooth. For this reason, Comrade Fu (then deputy minister of culture), made a call to Comrade Shao Yu (president and editor-in-chief), and sent me a letter of recommendation. Comrade Shao Yu met me at the house of the North Minshuku (demolished), of the People's News Agency. He was very enthusiastic, talking about half a day. Finally, I did not need to go to the 'picture book' after I entered the Renmin News Agency, and should go to the studio to paint oil painting on my condition. This arrangement made me quite unexpected. My reply was: I am the person wanted by the pictorial book. After entering the society, I would be embarrassed not to go to the painting room. After the move is not the following, many people say I'm silly. \\n1985 Comrade Jiang Weipu formed the Chinese comic book publishing house, 001 is my business, first borrowed and officially transferred, began my most intimate period with the business of comic book, but the publication 'Chinese comic book' is too busy, has rarely painted comic books.

As President Zhou Xiaozhou pointed out, the key to properly handling the internal contradictions of the people is to strengthen leadership. Therefore, it is necessary to study the relationship between the three major principles and party system. \\nNot all in favor and can not be wiped out\\nOver the past year, the introduction of party committee system in higher schools, although still in the process of exploring experience, has given rise to different views. Many academics and experts in higher education now advocate the abolition of party committees, while others prefer not to do so, but to improve working methods. At present there is no conclusive conclusion. We believe that the party system should be analyzed in a specific manner. It can neither be approved at all, nor can it be wiped out in a single way. The advantage of the party committee system is collective leadership, division of responsibilities, and comprehensive consideration of issues, which can prevent personal arbitrariness. Second, the Party Committee publicly appeared to guide the school's work, and could solve some problems in a timely manner. Again, the school party committee under the leadership of the provincial committee can combine local characteristics and carry out work. In case of problems, you can ask the Provincial Committee for advice. But the party system also has many drawbacks. First of all, because colleges of higher education are academic research occasions, it can neither be as closely organized and disciplined as in the military, nor can it socialize and mechanize the production process as in factories and mines. If they are out of reality, in higher schools, they require high concentration and urgent work. Near profit, neat and uniform, will form an excessive tension atmosphere, affecting the quality of teaching. Secondly, the most important thing is that at present the members of the Party Committee are rarely experts in a certain discipline. They lack experience in conducting higher education. Therefore, when the Party Committee studies policy policy policy, it is natural that the Party Committee cannot closely combine business and set up work, so that it can not lead the center work well in the college. And so many problems arise. But this will change gradually as the party develops among senior intellectuals. \\nWe believe that the Party committee should play a leading role in schools, but cannot issue orders with party representation. Because the party holds a leading position throughout the country, there is certainly no exception in higher education. The question is how best to lead. We believe that the Party should lead in ideological, political and organizational terms. That is to say, the Party uses Marxist Leninist positions, views and methods to observe problems and deal with problems, carry out school work in accordance with the central guidelines and policies, and through the party's organization, propaganda and mobilize the masses to work well. In particular, it is necessary to influence the masses through the exemplary actions of party members, so as to ensure the realization of the Party's policy and policies and complete the school's Central tasks. If this is the case, the existence of party committee system should not become a serious issue of debate. \\nCan not confuse the 'three harm' with the party system\\nThe problem now is that some people who mingle the subjectivity, bureaucracy, sectarianism and party committee expressed by minority party members, thus calling for the abolition of the party system, is, in our view, incomplete. \\nNumerous examples prove that many of the problems that exist in higher education today are subjectivity, sectarianism, bureaucracy, and not simply attributed to party commissions. This would make it possible to serve as a shelter for the three major principles and weaken the party's leadership role in higher education, let us illustrate the problem with facts. \\nThe most prominent is dogmatism\\nThe party asks its own party members to consider the problem from the actual point of view, but the subjectists are on the contrary. The most prominent manifestation is the hard-handed dogmatism. For example, when learning the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the implementation of central policies, time, conditions and places are rarely taken into account, and are generally mechanical shifts and layers are handed down. The most notable examples are the six-hour system, five-level scoring system, 45 minutes of lessons, as well as internships, oral examinations, etc., all of which have brought different degrees of difficulty to teaching work. Some have already been rectified and others continue to be implemented. Dogmatism and nihilism are inseparable. They did not understand the inheritance of culture, did not respect the historical heritage. In the early days of liberation, individual party members had advocated the burning of the lines of the Lake Great. Until recently, some people used some monuments from Yuelu Mountain to build roads, and the temple monuments of Tang Li Beihai's Foothills, famous in the country. Nor has it been well preserved. Especially for teachers to pay insufficient attention. Not sure that this is the power to rely on. Even some deviations occurred. Such as the late professors of Yi Dingxin, Tang Yijing and Li Fanxi, are all in engineering academics, but did not pay attention to their health, heavy work, and died after a stroke. Like Mr. Fang □, know that he has hypertensive disease. □ □ □ □ □ meeting, □ □ □ □ □ Pour at the venue. We know that learning is accumulating, not just a few. Therefore, you should care for the old professors, can not call for immediate, wielding away. Now we have to set up a department of geography and try to bring two professors. See the precious of the old teacher. But many of the precious riches still in school are still a blind eye. Why is this so? Because subjectists always emphasize the complexity of the social and historical relations of old teachers, they do not see the fundamental changes in their minds since their liberation, political awareness is constantly increasing, always looking at new things with old eyes, so rarely consider how to realize the potential of old teachers. The dangers of subjectivity are no small. \\nFrom the masses, out of the actual, hard and ridiculous\\nThe party requires its own party members to gain insight into the masses, to understand the situation, and to study and improve the work at any time. But the bureaucracy happens to be out of the masses and out of reality. They are busy meeting or listening to reports throughout the day, and some of the reports are not reliable or even realistic. Bureaucrats rarely come into contact with teachers to learn about their work and life, to the point that they are unclear. Particularly in the question of salary assessment. Make good things bad. Bureaucrats like large institutions, stacked beds. Teachers training colleges not only have kindergartens, primary schools and secondary schools, but also the further education department, correspondence department, especially the latter two. The teachers concerned are busy in their hands and feet, even shouting hard. It is difficult to estimate what effect is. However, the leadership of the hospital, grabbed one east, one in the west, and put the important work of academic research into the door. So bureaucratic is hard, but ridiculous. \\nThe authority of OHR is infinite\\nIn teacher training colleges, the bureaucratic shelf of the personnel department is more prominent. Some cadres are self-occupied by conquerors and reformers. They are not among the masses, but squatting above the masses. Since trial and counter-insurgency, the personnel department has become an independent kingdom. Youth in their twenties, casually call old teachers. An elderly man in his sixties was called to the Personnel Office, waiting a lot. No one was met, but those cadres were laughing with complacency, if no one was next. This teacher still holds a lot of dissatisfaction in mind. Many faculty members, as soon as they heard the personnel office came, they were frightened and did not know what evil was caused. The authority of the Personnel Service is infinite. Retention of assistants, teacher advancement, study abroad, salary assessment and even living benefits are determined in advance by the Personnel Office, and many of these decisions are taken out of the actual reality, from the masses and subjective fabrication. So the masses have the most opinion about the personnel office, almost to the level of anger and dare not to speak. It has been said that the bureaucracy of the school is not in the Imperial House (the seat of the courtyard's office), but in the personnel office, is true. \\nMost reluctant to admit sectarianism and, in fact, the worst\\nParty and Chairman Mao exhorted Party members to contact the masses closely, and have the obligation to work together only with outside the party. There is no right to exclude discrimination. However, sectarians are on the contrary, despise the masses and feel themselves and deal with things in one hand. These cadres are the least willing to admit that they have sectarianism, and in fact the worst. For example, a party member in charge of a unit of the Faculty said: We have subjectivity and bureaucracy here, and there may be some sectarianism. This word 'maybe' has aroused a lot of public opinion. Because this unit has serious sectarianism in terms of assignment, staffing arrangements and welfare of life. In addition, some members of the party conglomerates about sectarianism over the masses, and party members also call sectarianism. Expanded, sectarianism stands out throughout the Academy. So that a wall was built between the Party and the masses. In terms of affairs, some responsible comrades said: Party people engaging in Marxinism are not easy to make achievements. In terms of personnel arrangements, party members were promoted quickly. During the wage reform last year, some party members were higher than the masses, because sectarians subjectively believed that party members were always better than the masses. Some members of the party have a low culture and arbitrary placement of their families, and some capable staff have been eliminated without any political problems. Some people join the party, the problem of the work of the lover, soon solved. In terms of life and welfare, party members take care of more, some party members are sick, send cars to hospitals, and the general public, even if the disease is serious, it is rare to take care of this kind of care. No wonder one member of the party said to people: as long as you join the party, any problems will be solved. Obviously this is an unconscious exposure of privileged ideas. \\nSectarianism again manifests itself as uniformism\\nSectarianism, in turn, manifests itself as uniformism. In a college, sometimes this unit and the party of that unit have opinions, and there is friction between the college and the party committee. For example, the Party Committee's Propaganda Department of the two houses has been debated in order to show movies at the teachers' training colleges and civil construction colleges. For example, in order to compete for the Science Museum, the deputy general secretary of the party members of both houses, won't be happy. This means that there are sectarian sects among the sects, and their development is harmful to the cause of the Party. \\nThe lack of power of outsiders is the most concentrated manifestation of sectarianism\\nHowever, the most concentrated manifestation of sectarianism in higher education institutions is the lack of employment of outside the party. We believe that it is always because they have expertise and prestige since they are expected to be Presidents or Vice-Presidents. Then they should be given the right, otherwise it would simply be up to party members to act as well. The problem now is that in some higher schools, because party members do not have or lack professional knowledge and are not high in prestige, they have to rely on outside the party. But in fact, party members are in power. When there is a problem, foreign party personnel should also be jointly responsible. So they were dumb to eat yellow even, without charge. This situation must be rectified quickly in order to motivate outside the party. \\nThe relationship between the party and intellectuals in higher education is extremely abnormal.\\nIn short, subjectivity, bureaucracy, and sectarianism are anti-Marxist Leninism. One of these things must not be, because where the 'three major' exists, it creates artificial barriers between the party and the masses, which will affect the teaching and research work of schools. Today, the relationship between the party and intellectuals in higher schools is extremely abnormal. If the Party does not trust the teachers, it is also untrue. As we analyze, there are probably three categories: the first is believable, the second is half-faith, and the third is doubtful. The first and third of these three categories are rare, and the second category is the majority, arguably 'the middle two small'. Under these circumstances, the party will rely on young teachers and activists. But the consciousness of these people is also inconsistent. They can also be divided into three categories: the first category is true conscious words and deeds, the second class is progress as vanity, the third category is the fox false tiger Wei, for good blessing, such people have the worst impression among the masses, everyone said they are the ability to engage in sports, and the losers of business. But every movement, they have the opportunity to be promoted, sent out to learn, and even individual people are absorbed into the party. As a result, the more arrogant they are to the old teachers, the worse their old and new relations. So the party relationship is basically reflected in the relationship between this category of people and teachers. Academic air is currently relatively thin in colleges. Although there are many reasons, they are inseparable from subjectivity, bureaucracy, and sectarianism. Where these winds exist and develop, the central work of schools is often neglected, sometimes, confined to general calls and lacks concrete help. \\nGeneral teachers feel 'three busy' and 'three less'\\nHunan Normal University said that the general elderly teachers feel 'three busy' and 'three less', 'three busy' is busy meeting, filling out tables, writing materials (their own, others), busy. 'Three less' is that there are few books and materials, less research funds (the central government has no restrictions, but the hospital is shrunk and afraid to spend), and fewer opportunities for progress. Especially because the Ministry of Education is more frequent about teaching reform; the disorderly steps have caused many problems for teachers. For example, the development of the teaching plan and syllabus has been reversed, last year's teaching syllabus, this year's teaching plan will be carried out, and the syllabus will be carried out again next year. This makes teachers busy writing handouts for years. No more time to study and study. Some people say that doing so can only say [practice] write small letters. In fact, the teachers feel bored, and small characters will not progress. In the long run, we feel the 'crisis' of education. \\nNow the party committee can't play its role.\\nIn this case, the masses are accusing the party system of bad, although this is not comprehensive enough. However, the Party Committee's guidance and supervision over party members is not enough, and the Party Committee itself has problems with the 'three major principles'. Therefore, it is the fact that it cannot play its due role. However, it is not possible to conclude that the three major principles are created by the party committee system. \\nAdvocate for the establishment of the College (Colleges), Panel\\nIn order to firmly oppose subjectivity, bureaucracy and sectarianism and strengthen the leadership of the Party in higher education schools, we believe that the Party Committee should not withdraw from school, but should improve its work in ideological, political and organizational aspects so as to adapt it to the characteristics of higher schools. We are in favour of the establishment of a Council of Schools (Colleges), which has the power to deal with school plans, budgets, use and promotion of teaching staff throughout the year, especially major operational issues. Its membership includes representatives of the party, government and teachers, and is headed by the President, with decentralized authority. This will ensure the implementation of democratic centralization and effectively promote the future of school work. As for the personnel office to change the status of the current independent kingdom, it should be placed under the leadership of the school council, as in other offices, must be clearly defined and authority should not be arbitrarily abused. \\nThis is precisely to strengthen the party's leadership.\\nOur proposal like this cannot be understood as requiring the Party to abandon its leadership. On the contrary, it is precisely to strengthen the leadership of the Party, make the party leadership more principled and more focused. It is also only in this way that we can make the premises where the 'Three Kingdoms' have no return to hiding, such as 'rats cross the streets, people shout'. Will not spread. At the same time, we also do not agree with the idea that the mistakes of the three major principles are attributed to the mistakes of the party system, and thus to think that opposition to them would entail the abolition of the party's leadership, which is worth discussing. \\nExpose contradictions to resolve them\\nChairman Mao's theory of correct handling of internal contradictions among the people allows us to see more deeply and comprehensively the intrinsic and non-essential links of the problem, enabling us to mobilize more effectively all factors conducive to socialist construction and accelerate our progress. This is of great significance not only in theory but also in practice. Not only domestically but also in the international communist movement, and following the call of the Party and Chairman Mao, we bravely expose the current contradictions within the people. Because expose contradictions are precisely to resolve conflicts and promote the development of socialism, all discourse and actions that leave socialism is complete. All wrong. We love the cause of the Party and the cause of the people throughout the country. I believe that while dealing with the internal contradictions of the people correctly, the country will see a more vigorous and lively atmosphere of unity, opening up a better new article for the socialist construction of our great motherland. (Hunan Normal University professor Pi Namju, Luo Yulan, Jiang Yunkai, Lei Dare, Xie Yucai, the new Hunan newspaper in June 1957, No. 2818, a total of 8 editions today, address: Wumenkou, Changsha City)\\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attachment 2】The New Hunan Newspaper: 'The fight against the right is a particularly serious test for the organization of the agricultural and industrial and industrial party in Changsha City'\\n[Newsletter] So far, 148 members of the Democratic Party of Agriculture and Industry in Changsha City higher schools and health system's 10 grass-roots branches have revealed 34 right-wing elements in anti-right struggle, accounting for 22.98% of the total number of members of the 10 branches, and nine members of the Changsha City Committee of the Farmers' Democratic Party Out of two right-wing elements. The 10 grass-roots organizations of higher education and the health system and its development in Shaoyang and Hengyang cities have in the past seven branches and the Shaoyang City Liaison Group were manipulated or partially manipulated in the hands of right-wing elements. These figures illustrate the extent of right-wing activity within the province's A&M, as well as the current rectification campaign of democratic parties with the fight against the right, which is at a critical historical juncture for the leader, all members and organizations of the Party. A particularly serious test. \\nThey cooperated extremely badly with right-wing elements to attack the Communist Party.\\nThe role played by the right elements of the Hunan A&M Democratic Party in cooperating with the right-wing elements of all sides in using the Communist Party to attack the party is extremely bad. Some of these right-wing cadres, also in the face of 'urgent pioneer', cooperated with the right cadres of the NLD and other parties to attack the party at the provincial propaganda work meetings and in the forum of the CPPCC. Moreover, the ignition role they played in some grass-roots units, especially in higher schools, is really similar to that of the right-wing elements of the NLD, contributing to each other, creating a vicious wave of anti-communist anti-socialism in higher education schools. The blame is deep. \\nThe six branches of the Democratic Party of A&M have served as important backbone in anti-communist anti-socialism at various colleges, in addition to the faculty branch: teacher training colleges have skin names, Chen Yanwen, Hunan Medical College is Zheng Yiwen, Li Fengsun, and School of Mining and Metallurgy and Cai Chengyun. They work closely with the other right-wing elements in the College, either in the main attack, flank, or as a brigade, or behind-the-scenes maneuvers to carry out criminal anti-communist anti-socialist activities. \\nThey released a large number of poison arrows in an attempt to make the world chaos\\nThis group of people is intriguing, completely like his ancestor Zhang Bojun, considers the absolute advantage of the proletarian class as an absolute disadvantage, and thought that it can be mistreated in the world at once. Like Chen Yanwen, when the Communist Party embarked on the wind, shouted: 'Now the Communist Party has no mass base, we can do it.' Delusions put the party 'overthrow' and say what 'Hungarian events may repeat in China'. Because of this ambition and their totally false estimates, a number of poison arrows were released to the party under the guise of helping the Communist Party to rectify the wind. \\nThey neglected the facts of the socialist revolution and the achievements of the Party in leading various construction undertakings. As Chen Yanwen said, 'Communist Party leadership for seven years, developed to a bad level.' 'Now it is officials to take care of the party,' and 'Enterprises, the army, organs, schools, mess up.' He also said, 'The weather is like the Arctic Ocean,' he said. Attempts to describe the flourishing of colleges under the leadership of the Party as no success. \\nThey stand on the right-wing position of the bourgeois oppose various socialist systems, oppose various policies and policies to develop the socialist cause, especially attack the people's democratic dictatorship system, attack the Party's cadre policy, as well as reform of ideas and rebellion against intellectuals, and interrogation, etc. In his comments against the 'four winds', the skin name lifted a face against certain bad atmosphere, in fact fundamentally attacking the people's democratic dictatorship system. He first opposes the 'dictatorship of leadership,' which is to disagree with the so-called special leadership position of leadership and the power of leadership to decide questions. Anyone knows that today's leading organ represents the masses and serves the people. The people have taken control of power, have produced their own governing organs and leaders, and exercise their authority on their behalf. What is it not clear? And the skin name does not even agree! From the same standpoint, he also opposes 'the official style of the executive departments' and 'winds in the work', attacks on personnel management and other departments, slandering the anti-movement as 'pupil people abandon the city', and comparing the people's dictatorship to the enemy as the hardship of the feudal dynasty. These right-wing elements are opposed to what is obvious. Cai Chengyun also viciously attacked the Party's policy of talented cadre, describing it as 'noble talent, talent is not taboo'. Chen Yanwen also described the Party's ideological work on intellectuals as 'taking intellectuals as thieves'. Their aim is to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party. Such attempts are even more evident when they come into contact with specific problems. On the issue of the leadership system of higher schools, Pinnacle said, 'There are very few experts in disciplines in the members of the Party Committee and little experience in conducting higher education, and cannot lead the college's central work very well.' He put forward the idea of the school council governing schools and wanted to push out the party leadership. Chen Yanwen called more crazy: 'The layman cannot lead the insiders and want the Communist Party to step down!' \\nThey attacked the party against the people in such a vicious manner. \\nThey take all sorts of despicable means, and are committed to 'big democracy.'\\nIn addition to attacking the party leadership from the above aspects, from the organizational side, they also attacked the left, incited the middle masses, actively organized allied forces with the right of other democratic parties, and jointly attacked the party. At the Agricultural College, Li Fengsun has struggled to crack down on Zhou Ruhang, who represents the power of progress. At the same time, he collaborates with Li Zongdao, Wang Shugan and others of the right-wing Jiusan Society. In their own words, this is 'grasping the two democratic parties, he mastered the majority of the masses', and he also had a struggle for leadership with the Communist Party. political capital. In order to instigate some middle and backward masses in order to expand anti-Communist forces, Li Fengsun intends to seek out those opponents and pull them into the A&M Democratic Organization, saying he can 'grievance' for them. He also invited a number of people who were dissatisfied with the party to attend the meeting of agricultural workers and asked them to 'spit bitter water' at the meeting. In this way, the agro-industrial branch of the Agricultural College has actually become a forum for anti-communist and anti-socialism. Zheng Yiwen and Chen Yanwen in medical school and civil construction school are all pretext that party committee leadership is weak and deficient, advocating that all democratic parties set up joint organizations to lead the liberation. In this form of organization, the conspiracy brings together the forces of the various democratic parties to bring down the Communist Party. Chen Yanwen also sent to store Anping the wind briefing printed out by the civil construction, and wanted to 'let him synthesize it' in an attempt to exert pressure on the party with the help of central right-wing elements. Their intentions are spicy and thus exposed. \\nThey are also extremely instigating in the way of their activities. If Zheng Yiwen mobilizes the masses to lift their concerns, he said: 'The task of the A&M Democratic Party is to motivate the masses to enlarge, do not worry about attitude, do not consider words, or even consider whether the facts are true.' In Hunan Medical College, the democratic parties were the first to publish a inflammatory big print under the name of the organization. When some of the students at medical school attempted to act lightly, Zhou Xiaozhou, the first secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the CPC, came to make a report in person, convinced the students. Again, Zheng Yiwen and He He posted the big print newspaper against Comrade Zhou Xiaozhou's report, in an attempt to provoke the students to continue chaos and promote greater democracy. Rightists fear that the great democracy can't build up, they blatantly set fire among students. The right, Cai Chengyun, has close ties with the 'melting ice' and 'thaw' of the students of the School of Mining and Metallurgy. Li Fengsun is more active in the agricultural college to encourage students to trouble, praise the troubling students for brave, saying he is not as good as they are. He also supported the encouragement of the student's 'sweeping committee' to attack the party. With this encouragement, the center-right figures of the 'Sweeping Committee' openly gathered the students surrounded the dean's house and claimed that the dean roll out of the college. When the situation in the medical school was very confusing, Zheng Yiwen himself also wrote a note to the college administratively declaring that he would not attend Chinese medicine classes, trying to advocate for greater democracy first. \\nThis is not the same in higher education, in the medical and health sector, as well as in local organizations, where they are ignited. For example, in the fourth branch of medical and health, the cadres who went down repeatedly stressed that there was a Democratic Party of A&M support. It means not afraid of your grass-roots party organization, trying to mess up the whole wind movement. Party members of the Party's medicine and health department, Qian Huikang and others, have all been tasked to contact people outside the Party individually and gather opinions about the Communist Party. The agricultural and industrial branch of the provincial health and epidemic prevention station also wantamount to participate in the symposium on the medical and health system of the party's Changsha city. The conditions for being invited were: not party members and activists; 'Gunners', not 'Buddha'; this is clearly preparing bullets for an attack on the Communist Party. In order to incite the masses to attack the party, Zhou Zhouzhang, a member of the Epidemic Prevention Station, once did not work all day in the middle of the liberation period, ignited people in various sections and offices, advocating Chuanping's 'Party world' fallacy, saying that it did not speak wrong. Remind those who have opinions about the Communist Party not to lose their time. According to preliminary statistics, he instigated 22 workers, accounting for more than a third of the total number of workers in the epidemic prevention station. And Zeng Zhaozhi, a right-wing leader of the Agro-Industry Liaison Group in Shaoyang City, is not inferior to cooperate with the attack below, and launched members to collect 'opinions' on 14 aspects of the party's leadership as a weapon of attack. And put out rumors that the brushes in Changsha city were sold out, and leaflets were sent out on strike everywhere. I want to incite students to get up. \\nThere is also Xu Junhu, a right-wing member of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Agricultural and Labour Democratic Party (municipal committee member and organization director). Xu fabricated that the Communist Party had become corrupt and deteriorated, saying that the Communist Party did not care about the life of peasants, and attacked the party. He controlled most of the full-time cadres of the party's Changsha Municipal Committee, and also plays a direct guidance role in setting fire activities below, such as Zeng Zhaozhi. \\nChangsha City Committee faithfully implemented the organizational line of Zhang-Huang Li vicious development\\nThe above cases are not accidental. On the one hand, there are profound historical roots. Some of them, such as Xu Junhu and others, were the right in the democratic revolution. After liberation, on the other hand, the Changsha City Committee faithfully implemented the organizational line of Zhang Bojun-Huang Qixiang-Li Boqiu's vicious development, has a direct relationship. In order to realize their political ambitions, Zhang Bojun and others have repeatedly shouted 'big development' and 'break the prevention zone' on the organizational route. The Changsha Municipal Committee of the Agricultural and Labour Democratic Party has repeatedly criticized the following implementation, and, in addition to actively developing organizations in the medical and health community, and to expand widely to cultural, educational, organs and other democracies. Party scramble for objects. Since the second half of last year, the Changsha City Organization of the Agricultural and Labour Democratic Party has embarked on a path of vicious development. And there is no means in the development organization to pull people everywhere. Some people say that the Hunan Agro-Industrial Development Organization is 'people on the road', indeed this is the case. When Li Fengsun developed a professor, when the interview was not found, he filled his name in the column 'Introducing Person' on the Application Form for Admission to the Party, and stuffed it into his room from the window. In addition, in development organizations, the Agricultural and Labour Party also uses a set of methods such as soliciting guests, sending books, pleading officials, and deception. When Xu Junhu developed his organization in Shaoyang, he bragged the history of the A&M Democratic Party (formerly the third party), more than the Communist Party. Zeng Zhaozhi said that 'the A&M Party can think independently, meet not many, and free'. The official wishes to take a look at Xu Junhu's development of Jiang Yaofei in Shaoyang. When Xu mobilized Jiang to join the agricultural laborers, 'There are many people in the NLD literary and religious circles, and you struggle for power, you do not win them. There are many agricultural physicians and technicians, they have no political intention. You can be a 'head' without problems, and serve as a member of the CPPCC and people's representatives in the future. Mayor. Chinese Hospital Li Cong Fu also made deceptive propaganda to the masses with the idea that 'no agricultural workers can join the Communist Party' or 'it takes 10 years to join the Communist Party, it will take 10 years to join the Communist Party'. The incident of Xu Mei Chun's withdrawal from the Party, which was once a major article by right-wing agro-industrial right-wing elements, is actually mainly an example of the inevitable consequences caused by agro-industrial deceptive development organizations. And when the cadres of the Changsha Municipal Committee of Agriculture and Industry are developing organizations below, they also openly stated that the conditions for development are 'politically backward and have more views on the Communist Party, and representative people'. In fact, these activities are an important part of Zhang Bojun's anti-party agenda. They are outposts to attack the party. Leaders of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Agricultural Workers and Workers Democratic Party cannot shirk their serious responsibilities on this. \\nAfter the executive chapter of Changsha City Committee of the Agricultural and Labour Democratic Party, Huang-Li's organizational line of vicious development, led to a vicious expansion of the party's organization. It is not surprising that the number of members has more than doubled in less than half a year, while people with complex political conditions and dissatisfied with the party are recruited. It is not surprising that there are eight of the 17 right-wing elements (nearly half), of the newly established grass-roots branches, such as the Hunan Medical College branch. \\nChangsha Municipal Committee of the A&M Democratic Party should immediately go poison and take the serious test of anti-right struggle\\nFrom the above facts, it seems that the sores in the body of the Changsha City Chairman of the Agricultural and Labour Democratic Party have reached the time to soak out the whole body, and then poison the whole body, and then poison, and will not cure. However, the Changsha Municipal Committee of A&M was hesitant in the fight against the right, such as a major revolution in the political ideology of capitalism and socialism. In addition to anti-right struggles organized at grass-roots level schools, health and other grass-roots organizations, under the unified leadership of the CPC Committee of the Communist Party of the Party Committee of the Party of Agriculture and Labour, the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Agricultural Workers and Workers Democratic Party, against the right-wing member of the municipal committee, Xu Junhu, the head of the organization of the municipal committee, was weak in the previous paragraph. Judging from the situation of a period of movement in the past, the leaders are not determined, the movement lacks long-term arrangements, and the masses have not carried out a very detailed launch. To Zhao Fansheng, known as the 'key to Xu Junhu's safe cabinet' (Xu's cronies and head of the office of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Farmers' Democratic Party), did not carry out Some people still unclear the boundaries with Xu Junhu. At the critical meeting, they fought Xu persuasively, and Also cry for him nose. The anti-right struggle of the Liaison Group of the Democratic Party of A&M in Shaoyang City has also been pushed by the masses for a few times. At the same time, at an anti-right meeting of the Shaoyang CPPCC, 14 members of the A&M Party withdrew together, causing blame from the masses. According to these circumstances, it is necessary for the leaders of the A&M Democratic Party to treat the struggle against the right as a serious test for the democratic parties, as the turning point for the fundamental transformation of the IOM, to seize the time, redouble their efforts to outperform the socialist revolution in political ideology.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached 3] Liu Yi-qing: 'Southwest United General Assembly Professor's Skin Name'\\nPi name lifts, Changsha, born in 1907 in a famous home of copper officers, grandfather Pisiri, is a famous master of economics in the Qing Dynasty. Pi family origin, talent generation, several children are noisy scholarly giants, such as Pizong stone, Pi name Zhen are. Some of them have also been president of Hunan University. \\nIn 1927, he went to the United States to study abroad, specializing in world history, advanced Yale University, and later at Harvard University, with a PhD. 1935 returned to the country. After returning home, he was hired as an associate professor at Peking University, less than a year to become a famous teacher in the history department of the school. In 1937, Kou trapped me Beiping, Peking University, Tsinghua, Nankai three schools were ordered to move south, set up Changsha Interim University in Changsha, and soon moved west to Kunming, set up Southwest United University, Mr. Pi has been following the action. During the coaching of the Peking University and the General Assembly, Mr. Pi has lectured on Western history, recent history of the West, 19th century history and modern Western history. \\nIn Yi Sheqiang's book Southwest General Assembly: Chinese University in War and Revolution, we can learn about the image of Mr. Pi Namigu. 'He is William L. Langer, a man of Hunan, tall and thin, loud and beard.' Classroom teaching, the skin name lifts in the spicy irony, compared with Wu Han, there is no better. Unlike Wu Han, he has nothing to do with anyone, from communism to Christian ideology, and is extremely scavenly taunting. He told students that the invention of liveword printing is very important because it allows people to turn 'God' into 'Dog' and 'Dog' into 'God'. \\nNext, it was disturbing to mention the United Nations General Assembly professor by the name. He directed his bitter and ironic remarks at Principal Mei Yiqi and Provost Pan Guangdan. He said in class that if a student wants to figure out the attempt to dominate the residence of Julius Caesar, he would advise them to observe their principal. He claims, 'If you know Mei Yiqi, you can know Caesar.' If it seems inappropriate to say that the portrayal of the moderate and humble May, then his cold hardships on the one-legged Provost Pan Guangdan, would be close to a thin picture. He said, 'God has revived the blind and restored the weak, while Pan Guangdan has been in Christ for so many years, three legs (a true leg, a wooden prosthetic limb, and a crutch). Such unobtrusive praise colleagues, not to mention above the lecture, in today's view, incredible. But, precisely so, the freedom and mass of the General Assembly can be seen. The skin name lifts and Liu Wendian, have a crazy temperament. \\nWang Zengqi does not fall in love with the general history On one occasion, a map of the Kingdom of Macedonia was handed over. Mr. Pinato approved two sentences in his work: the art of your map is of great value and no scientific value. It seems that the skin name lifts the gravings of colleagues, and the students are encouraged and loved. \\nStill, there are still students who can't stand the name, go to another class to learn Western history. This class is taught by Tsai Weifan, who is a man and good. When it comes to student selection, compared with the kind Cai, the indifferent and arbitrary skin name is still very competitive, because Cai is not like a scholar. Although classrooms were overcrowded, Cai (bachelor's degree from Jinling University, University of Illinois), 'was not recognized by professors and students,' a former colleague wrote, 'Actually, his studies are almost the same level as his undergraduate graduates. So he has nothing to communicate with the professor.' On the other hand, in the opinion of colleagues, Pi is educated and 'knowledgeable' in Tsinghua and Harvard. As a teacher, he is highly respected. (Yi Sheqiang, Southwest General Assembly: China University in War and Revolution)\\nIn 1942 Mr. Pi left Kunming and returned to Hunan, he was a professor of the National Normal College, Director of History Department, Provost and Acting Dean. Mr. Pi on the complex personnel relations of the hospital during the acting department, felt difficult to deal with, and was applied to Hunan University in August 1948, teaching the history of world history, Western history and other courses. In September 1949, Changsha peacefully liberated, Mr. Pi remained teaching at Hunan University. After the faculty adjustment in 1953, he stayed to teach in the history department of the newly established Hunan Normal University. \\nIn the spring of 1957, 'big Ming', the skin name lifted up in sincere response, not only their own 'song', but also encouraged others to 'put'. Linked to his 'rhetoric' at the Southwest General Assembly, that kind of spiritual temperament is 'transformation' can not be lost, can be said to be consistent, can also be said to be independent personality. In a joint statement with five professors including Lin Zhaoyu (which should be Luo Yilan-Wuyi three notes), Lei Dare, Jiang Yunkai, Xie Yucai and other five professors at the meeting of the CPPCC in Hunan Province, criticized the phenomenon of 'party representation' in the work of universities and endorsed the establishment of the school committee and implement the responsibility system of principals under the leadership of the Party Committee. Four of the professors were put on a 'right' hat, and only Mr. Lam Siu Yung was 'protected'. \\nMr. Pi, a book student, was not strong in height and was infected with tuberculosis. After this heavy blow, he fell ill. The 'right' hat was worn for only a year, and he was sorry to go. \\nPAGE 11"}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】Zheng Ligang: 'The wind and rain are all over, still the first mountain in southeast-commemorating the beloved mentor Professor Qin Yuanxun' (2008 Huaxia Express)\\nShe was surprised to learn that Professor Qin Yuanhun (everyone hailed as Qin Gong), died before the Mid-Autumn Festival. These past days, the days with Qin continue to be screened in the minds like a movie. The voice of the mentor is as if it was in sight; the teachings of the mentor seemed to be yesterday. I have constantly turned over the letters and articles that Qin Gong sent to me for 20 years. Between the lines, enlightened thinking, different talents, leapfrog on paper; long and short sentences, Mr. bumpy life, sad world, all in it. \\na\\nIn the spring of 1982, I started preparing my university thesis. Professor Wang Zhicheng asked me to read an article by Qin Gong on the periodic solutions of the cycle coefficients Riccati equation and see if I can do some work in this area. This question was raised by Professor Chen Shengshen during his lecture on the confinement of space curves at the Chinese Academy of Sciences: Under what conditions does the cycle coefficient Riccati equation dy/dx=a (x), Y2+b (x), y+c (x), have periodic solutions? This problem attracted Qin's attention on the spot. He was keenly aware of the algebraic properties of Riccati equation, and after the report, told Professor Chen Shengshen that there should be periodic solutions when B2 (x)-4A (x), C (x), ≥0. Professor Chen was surprised to see Qin asked whether this was a known result. Qin replied that he did not know, but the result should be right. He later published this result in Scientific Bulletin [2] and wrote it in his monograph, Theory and Application of Motion Stability [3]. \\nIn line with Qin Gong's thinking, under the guidance of Professor Wang Zhicheng, I got a new condition, and gave examples of periodic solutions that could not be judged under the conditions of Qin Gong and I could use my method to determine the existence of periodic solutions. Professor Wang Zhicheng was very satisfied with my work. At the National Conference on Differential Equations in the summer of 1982, Qin Gong briefed Qin on my results. Qin Gong is very pleased that in his concluding remarks, I and several other young people were devoted to the work of me and a few other young people. We also wrote our name on the blackboard: to pay attention to and carry on young people, and to the hope and love of young people. \\nèr\\nIn autumn 1982, I came to Tsinghua University in Beijing to become a graduate student of Professor Qin Yuanxun and Professor Pu fuquan Quan Pu fuquan Quan. At that time, Tsinghua University hired famous scholars such as Qin Yuanhun, Chen Xiju, Wan Zhexian and Zeng Kencheng as part-time professors at Tsinghua University in order to strengthen mathematics education and research among its postgraduate and undergraduate students. \\nQin Gong was deputy director at the Institute of Applied Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Director: Huao, Mr. Hua Luogeng), and personally chaired the weekly discussion class on regular differential equations. The first time I met Qin Gong was in a discussion class. Nearly 60 Qin Gong full of brunette, wearing a deep myopia glasses, walked in with a smile. To everyone, sit down in the first row, the discussion class began. The discussion class began like this in the years that I attended. \\nAfter this discussion class, Qin Gongte met our new graduate students in his office. When I told Qin Gong my name, Qin Gongte walked up and shake my hands with me and said you were doing a good job of Riccati equation. Next, he said to all of us a word that I would never forget for life: 'I do not ask you to join the party, but ask you to be patriotic!' \\nI am still thinking about the meaning of this sentence until now. In the most dangerous days of the Chinese nation, Qin Gong, who studied with Professor Su Buqing in Guizhou's ravine, won the love and appreciation of his classmates and teachers with his brilliant talents, excellent results, honorable character, and sound physique. Mr. Zhu Kezhen, Chancellor of Zhejiang University, wrote more than once in his diary [4] about the young talent. Graduated from university, young, he went to the Pacific East Coast of the United States, at the recommendation of Chancellor Zhu Kezhen, entered Harvard University, into the famous maths master Saunders Maclane to study Ph.D., and gave the generation of rookie and later writings Professor Garrett Birkhoff (his Father George David Birkhoff was the first American to become a master of mathematics and a professor at Harvard University. With the pride of 'born I must use [5]', the talent of 'a sword once a million division [6]', and the pursuit of 'don't have to be born, I wish to know Han Jingzhou [7]', as well as Lu Xun's efforts to take someone else's time to drink coffee to read books, Qin obtained Harvard in 1947 The university's doctorate, 24 years old, was the youngest PhD in Harvard's history. Ph.D. Prof. Maclane and Birkhoff appreciated their talents and gave him a privileged place to continue his research, but Qin Gong refused to return to the war-torn homeland. \\nIs this perhaps the true meaning of what Qin Gong calls 'patriotic'? In the 1980s, when I read PhD abroad myself, the walls of the faculty corridors were filled with portraits of masters, including Newton, Benuli, Euler, Gauss, Galowha, Hilbert, Minkovsky... and the contemporary George David Birkhoff and Saunders Maclane. Birkhoff and Maclane are just the tap of drinking water not far from my office. Every time I go to drink water, I have to face 'master' and 'master' father. I often don't have to lament. This lamented there for their own, but more for Qin Gong. \\nThree thousand sons of the Confucius, but seventy. My own talent is limited, efforts are not enough, worthy of the senior teacher, this is also the common sense of people. However, on the other hand, Yu Qin Gong, if he did not return to China and continued to work with his mentor; if he did not go back to the right (the direct result was that Professor Po Pu fuquanquan, the first two graduate students of Qin Gong, were the right, and Professor Dong Jinzhu became an alternative figure that was not reused. At that time, under the guidance of Qin Gong, the two made important results and methods that have been frequently quoted on the issue of Hilbert 16th), without a series of storms such as the Cultural Revolution, can have a calm study to put down a desk that is not protected from the wind and rain, like its Harvard Can the portrait of Qin Gong also hang on the wall here for later students? \\nHistory cannot assume that it cannot be overridden. With his talent, if he continued to work with his mentor then, dare not to say that he will certainly be able to make the performance of the gods in shock, and then he can go side by side with his masters and masters in history; but at least it can be done on the picture of history, and he can also have a share of Ann Settle and comfortable life. But he just chose to return to that disastrous land, where history and reality did not have to make people not 'sigh and mourn for many hardships [8]'. This seemingly personal, ordinary move at the time, seems to have the sentiment and meaning of charcoal in the snow today. \\nNot to mention the more than a dozen monographs he has published so far; numerous articles he has published that are still quoted today; ignore one issue after another he has solved; not to talk about his contribution after another; just look at how many talents Qin Gong has cultivated for China and how many fields, there is this snow. 'Send charcoal' is not enough to sigh! \\nFrom Po Pu fuquanquan, Dong Jinzhu, Liu Yongqing, Cai Suilin, Wang Lian, Wang Muqiu, and later Guan Keying, Zhang Suochun; from the stability of the common differential equation, to the theory of atomic bombs, hydrogen bomb explosion theory; from computational physics to artificial intelligence; Qin Gong really did his work as both an open wind and a division. He is not an isolated thinker (lonely wolf of the West Proverb), he founded and built a school. All of these results are left in China. In the 1990s, when he studied time, space, and quality, obtained a new invariant under Lorenz transformations, he knew the significance of this work, and even though he had lived abroad for many years, published the results in China's Scientific Bulletin. [9]\\nAs if history often had to joke with people, so that future people would not complain about the absence of material and could not write a tragedy, Qin Gong's contribution to the country, in the influence of academics, when he first elected a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences after the Cultural Revolution, Qin Gong should be well deserved. In fact, he has almost become a member of the new college, only after the central government approval. At that time, the winds of scientific salvation were strong, and the times also strongly called on youth representatives. In this context, do high-level people speak, this time, let some young comrade, others can consider it later? Of course, political needs dictate everything. Qin Gong had to wait again. After many years later, Qin Gong was a visiting professor at the University of Florida (Gainesville, Florida). Really, 'Wei Qing undefeated by Tianxing, Li Guang reactive power number odd [10]!' \\nWhoo! Shi Sima moved to a generation of talents Li Guang's earthly talents and bumpy life deeply moved, the pen end full of feelings wrote the name 'flying general Li Guangchuan' [11]. The colleagues, teachers, students, and friends who know Qin Gong's work are not deeply unbalanced and regretted. 'The crown is full of Jinghua, the people of the people languish [12]'. Qu Yuan lamented 'no one in the country has no one to know, and why all [13]', Mr. Laoshe outrated in his masterpiece 'Tea House' outraged 'I love our country, but who loves me?' [14]'\\nSan\\nSince he followed Qin's postgraduate students, his contacts with Qin Gong have been increasing, and their understanding and respect have also deepened. Most of the time the discussion class is Qin Gong asking outside people to do the report, and occasionally we also speak about our own work. Some reports are inexplicable; some are surprising; some are admirable; others are not very annoying. After each report, Qin Gong always summarizes the problems, background, methods, and results of the report. This is not more than half an hour of summary. Every person has a feeling of freshness after rain, I don't know how many times. After the discussion class, everyone agreed that nearly two hours of discussion class, we have benefited most from Qin Gong's summary. \\nDue to the wide interest of Qin Gong, the scope of the report at the workshop was also very broad. It also opened our horizons and increased knowledge. Qin Gong always gives great encouragement to students and descendants to work. Shortly after I attended the discussion class, Qin Gong asked me to make a report on the Riccati equation. Remember once Qin Gong asked Professor Dong Jinzhu about his work in astrobody mechanics. After the report was finished, Mr. Dong (only a young age than Qin Gong), said that Qin Gong was too polite and too kind. Qin also referred to Mr. Dong's famous result: the moon was not a planet of the Sun and could not be captured by the sun in the future. \\nQin Gong particularly encourages you to ask questions. On one occasion, Professor Taro Yoshizawa, a well-known master of differential equations, gave a report to you, and I felt that one result of Mr. Yoshizawa was impossible without certain conditions, without realizing that another condition was equivalent to that condition. So myself recklessly raised his hand to interrupt the master's speech. After the master understood my problem, immediately pointed out the equivalent conditions. At that time, I regretted that I did not see clearly and asked questions, crashed the master. Qin Gong did not have any dissatisfaction at all, but felt that I had the courage to face the master is very good. \\nIn my nearly four years of discussion class, Qin Gong almost never talked about his work, let alone about his great contribution to the country and his troubled life. Much about Qin Gong's life and work, I know from his colleagues, past students, and later on many communications and calls abroad and Qin Gong. This is more of the noble personality and spirit that is unspeakable behind the story.  \\nOn the wall of Qin's living room, hanging a certificate for him and his colleagues (remember Zhou Guangzhao, Peng Hengwu and others), 'First Prize in Natural Science/Atomic Bomb, Hydrogen Bomb Theory'. This is clearly an achievement that Qin Gong is proud of, and other winners are their best friends. But he never mentioned his work in this area, and no one knows, except on a very small scale, that he has worked in this field, let alone his great contribution. I didn't know it myself. Remember in Beijing four years, Qin Gong only mentioned me twice. One time, after the discussion class, I hope to have further discussions with Qin Gong. Qin Gong said today it was really bad enough to go to a banquet at night, and also had to make a poem. Writing poetry touched my curiosity and asked what to be so elegant? He laughed and said that everyone is a vestial style, it is really not full of elegance. Only today is the twentieth anniversary of the atomic bombing (October 16, 1984). General Zhang Aiping invited everyone to celebrate together. General was a poet, and invited everyone to write a few words, so there was a move of style and elegance today. From Qin Gong, riding on Zhongguancun Street, the autumn wind slightly blows my hair, but I feel very excited. Yeah, just 20 years ago today, my mentor and his colleagues, with the support of the people across the country, made a shocking cause, cry the devil! This loud voice has not had to let the whole world look at this ancient and mysterious country of the East! \\nEveryone knows the great contributions made by the famous maths masters John von Neumann [16] and Stanislaw Ulam [17] in the development of atomic and hydrogen bombs. Qin Gong played a role of this kind in China's two rounds. His colleagues often compared Qin Gong to von Neumann. \\nAnother time, after someone reported work on computational physics, Qin Gong mentioned one thing he did about calculating the power of atomic bombs. If the energy released by the atomic bomb is not large enough, I am afraid the US and the Soviet Union will not detect (especially the US); but if too large, there are many technical limitations that will make the entire project difficult. Qin Gong said that he was in charge of the project and had to sign when he finished, so he had to sign it hard on the scalp. On the day of the explosion, after a loud sound, Qin Gong and his colleagues all cheered-only Qin Gong couldn't be happy yet. He still had to wait for the pilot to come back. He also had to wait for reports from the US and the Soviet Union that China had conducted nuclear tests. \\nFour\\nIn 1982, after I went to Tsinghua, I went to visit Mr. Pu first. When I asked about possible topics in the future, Mr. Pu said that because you have done a little work, Qin Guild has some arrangements for you. Qin Gong gave me the topic of the stability of the finite variable coefficient motion system. This issue has a very realistic engineering background, and Qin Gong first learned from Soviet experts working at the time at Beihang. They have a set of engineering things, and most of the time seems to be very useful, Qin Gong, so he brought this issue to the height of the theory, hoping to give a perfect theoretical result and support this set of methods. \\nBecause of the country's needs, Qin Gong was not able to carry out this work immediately, and went to participate in the research and development of the atomic bomb. \\nLater, there was a cultural revolution, including decentralization to dry schools. When the Chinese nation awakened from this nightmare, Qin Gong was already a man of his destiny. There are too many things to do. Qin Gong first chose the hardest problem of Hilbert 16th issue. This, from Qin Gong's first graduate students Po Pu fuquanquan, Dong Jinzhu made the question of the method that people still have to follow so far. \\nHowever, other colleagues in the academic community began to work on the issue of the stability of the finite variable coefficient of motion. After some time of effort, as if the problem had been solved, and the results were written into articles and put to Science in China. When Qin Gong reviewed, but found that the article was wrong. As a result, the author made a few easy drafts, and Qin Gong also tried several times. 'Several times almost let it pass', Qin Gong told me a few days later. \\nBefore the summer vacation in 1983, Qin Gong called me to do my postgraduate thesis on this subject, but Qin Gong did not tell me about the background of this issue, including the unsuccessful work of colleagues in this area. So the problem was that I was like an unreclaimed virgin land, and I could sow the seeds I imagined on it and let it blossom on it, as a result. Years later, when I recall these details, I can deeply appreciate Qin Gong's painstakes and expectations for me, and he has considered for me everywhere. On the one hand, he felt that I might be able to do some work on this issue; on the other hand, he feared that if I knew that a fairly successful colleague did the issue and had not been successful, I would be able to carry the burden. \\nAll my efforts on this issue during the 1983 heat have been ineffective. Turn around, best not essential. In the first week after my summer vacation, I turned a book on special functions at the Department's library, and suddenly realized that the question I had struggled can be found from this book, proving that the reference to this question is wrong in the general sense! It was 'suddenly looking back, but the man was at the light [18]'. I am very happy, and quickly write the results ready to be handed over to Qin Gong after the next discussion class. To my surprise, Qin Gong did not rush to hear me explain my results, but asked me to go back and check it out if there was a mistake. When I told Qin Gong that I had looked repeatedly several times, he laughed and said it was a difficult problem, and if you did, I would immediately let you graduate (at this time I studied a year of graduate students), go back and think back and see it again. That's when I realized that I might have frightened the problem, maybe my approach was wrong, and it should be thoroughly checked again. Returning to Tsinghua, once again, under the lights of the library, I carefully looked at the results I wrote down, indeed, right ah. I had to wait for the next time I see Qin Gong. In this long week, I had to borrow Mr. Zhou Ruchang's New Dream Card from the library to spend this restless and longing time with me (Age of anxiety, Leonard Bernstein's 2nd Symphony). \\nWhen I came to the discussion class the next time I came to the discussion class, just saw Qin Gong and his mother walked up at the door. Qin Gong called me aside and said to me in a serious and serious tone that your results were right, but don't speak to anyone for the time being. Please stay and discuss with me after the discussion class is over. I listened to the words very happy, many days of nervousness, anxiety and restlessness swept away. After the discussion class, Qin Gong called me to his office, told me the context of the issue, and told my colleagues about these unsuccessful efforts, 'Liapunov's function for decades is still not closed,' Qin said with regret. Qin Gong then put forward the direction and idea of how to continue doing the next step. Under the guidance of Mr. Qin Gong and Pu, I quickly completed this job. It was passed in March 1984, and became the first graduate student in my grade to pass the defense, when enrolled in a year and six months, many students had just begun research on the subject. On the day of my reply, Professor Xiao Shutie was personally the chairman of the defense committee, Mr. Qin Gong and Pu, Professor Dong Jinzhu, Fellow Wang Lian (Institute of Mathematics, Chinese Academy of Sciences), and Professor Huang Wenzao (Peking University). After Mr. Xiao announced that my defense was adopted, he made a special statement of thanks to Qin Gong for his care, help, and support to Tsinghua. Yeah, from Mr. Pu from the 1950s to me and other classmates in the 1980s, Qin Gong did much effort for Tsinghua! \\nA few days later, Qin Gong told me that we should publish this result. There are two places to consider, one is the Scientific Bulletin and the second is China Science. The Scientific Bulletin is about a little faster. What is my opinion? At that time, I was young and felt that China Science had a better place. I actually said to Qin Gong, I thought it was still 'China Science' good. Qin Gong seems to understand my thoughts and motivations (young man's vanity!), , say, 'China Science' is fine. \\nAfter a while, Qin Gong took me again. At that time, the school had decided to keep me in school, let me take part in a topic for the Ministry of Space, and some other work. There were a lot of things down the day. Instead, I felt more busy than I was going to graduate students. Qin asked me what new ideas and progress had recently been made, and I had to tell truthfully that there was nothing new and was considering how to write this article. After listening and smiling, Qin told me that he recently got a new result, making the original results more complete and more practical. He handed me a bunch of paper, 'I also prepared a draft for our article,' and he went on to say, 'Look, change it.' Holding these dense manuscripts written by the teacher, looking at the harmonious vision of the enshi, I can't even say anything. \\nThe Chinese text of this article was sent in October 1984 and was published in China Science, Series A 1986, No. 11. The English text was published in the ninth issue of 1987. Prior to the publication of the English text, Qin Gong made further amendments in December 1986. At that time, I was studying a doctor abroad, and the whole job was done by Qin Gong. \\nIt was interesting to say, this article also played an interesting episode in my family later. In the fall of 1985, I first went to my current lady, when my girlfriend was home to meet her parents. After a few words, the future grandfather-in-law turned to the topic and asked me if I had an article published. (Nerd General Taishan-Tsinghua University professor's question of future son-in-law is naturally nerd-like!), I never thought that after so many exams, I had to ask myself for the student exam today, at a critical moment in my life, would face such an examination question. I had to say hard on the scalp, there was an article that was about to be published. Regardless of the nerd-like future husband is very savvy, poor chasing, and then asked there, (the kind of real and real, moulling two answer to the exam in this does not work!), 'Science of China.' I said it reliably. This answer is really the top thing, very good. Many teachers at Tsinghua University struggled not to send a single article in their lifetime, and the future husband praised me. With the guidance and help of Qin Gong, my 'qualification examination' passed so smoothly. \\nToday, I have a heavy mood with this article, which was more than 20 years ago. Over the past two decades abroad, I also have the opportunity to reach out to scholars in my country, and through various channels, I have some knowledge of the culture and quality of my country. Recall the academic ethics, style, and achievements of Qin Gong and other older generations of scholars, and then look at today's situation, it really makes people lament the world's wind, and people's hearts are all too old! The Nguyen of the Jin Dynasty exclaimed: 'No hero, make the erection fame [19]!' Today, it makes people not by the world no hero, make a sense of clutter. I've met with a hundred years, and Dr. Pu fuquanture Star, who published up to five (review, initial results, mid-term results and outlook, final results and future directions), was interviewed to apply to my PhD. \\nAfter 30 years of reform and opening up, the country has indeed achieved the achievements of the world's decision. Yesterday a sentence can depreciate the dollar and influence world finance; today you can spend a lot of money to run a truly unprecedented Olympic Games, and take gold medal first laurel with the king's generosity. Tomorrow intends to send the Chinese people to the moon, so that Chang'e's dream of reunion with his family is just around the corner. But on the other hand, when poisonous milk has devastated the health of more than 50,000 children, the government completely lost its functions; when all kinds of fake goods flooded the market, people have doubts about everything; should we ourselves not think of old generation scholars like Qin Gong as a reference system? Especially those who hang a name, let others bring 'their own' PhD students, master students, and then write their own name on the article, should not weigh the meaning of their 'famous'? \\nFive\\nIn the early days of reform and opening-up, the Chinese people awake from a series of nightmares such as anti-right, cultural revolution and other nightmares began to realize their place in the world and work for it. The sports world first showed the spirit of self-improvement under the sense of anxiety among the Chinese nation. Many of my age may remember the dangerous situation of the Chinese men's volleyball behind South Korea in the second innings, broke an axe and sank a boat, united, hard as a ball and one ball, and finally took the ball with the courage of the soldiers to win the ball to celebrate and exhale the historic slogan of 'Revitalizing China'. Education also began to think about high levels of education in the fashion of 'going out of Asia to the world'. \\nIt was about 82 years ago and about 82 years when China really seriously marched toward the PhD level. I remember that Mr. Ouyang Zhong Can, Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (last year's friend of Qin Gong, Mr. Peng Hengwu died, and Mr. Ouyang wrote a very moving article to commemorate Mr. Peng), who lived on the same floor with us and worked hard for the PhD. As if a woman of nearly 40 years had her first birth, academia and education were cautious about it, 'like an abyss, like a thin ice [20]'. After the first doctoral defense at that time, the Xinhua News Agency sent a press release, which was also reported in other media. The defense committee is composed of more than 10 famous scholars, including Hua Luogeng and Qin Yuanhun, to ensure the quality and authority of the degree. \\nOn the day I stayed at Tsinghua University shortly after my master's graduation, Qin Gong called me to his office and told me that he planned to recruit a PhD student and did not want to recruit from outside, and asked me to be prepared to follow him for a doctorate. Having listened to that, I feel very contradictory. On the one hand, after having spent two years with Qin, I knew he had a great deal for me, and I was hoping I could do a better job. Being able to read a doctor (which was really not much in the year), and can read it under Qin Gong's hands is very rare; but on the other hand, at the bottom of my heart, I feel like realizing that if I can go abroad, I might have a greater impact on my life. This contradiction is inextricably manifested in my face and in my words. I bowed my head and gently called Qin Gong, and then I couldn't go down. At this point he seems to understand where I have trouble, kindly said to me, you say ma (I still remember clearly Qin Gong this sentence with Guizhou cavity). I summed up the courage and said, Qin Gong, I thought to go overseas to study a PhD. Qin Gong understood, and said to me, this is also very good, I understand your thoughts, and I will support it. \\nIn the future, in order to study abroad, I had trouble Qin Gong many times. Ask him to write a letter of recommendation for me and give me an idea. At that time, at the invitation of Liu Jie (the organizer of China's atomic bomb project), and overseas Chinese, Qin Gong was also the president of Huanghe University, founded by overseas Chinese. Many times worked in Zhengzhou, and when he returned to Beijing, all kinds of affairs needed his time and energy. But every time I go to him, he is keen to help me. \\nDuring my Ph.D., Qin Gong wrote several letters to me, and had detailed guidance and care about my research topics and my future intentions. Sitting in front of the window today, looking at the blue sky and white clouds and leaves full of maple trees outside the window, holding letters from Qin Gong to me these years, I am very uncalm, and tears flowing down with the third movement of Gustav Mahler's first symphony, in order to sleep in this beautiful land. For this deep mentoring. \\nliù\\nThe fourth session of the International Conference on Differential Equations and Differential Geometry (commonly known as the Double Microconference), was held in Beijing on August 29, 1983. The first report of the meeting was a thematic report by Qin Gong on the sixteenth issue of Hilbert. Qin Gong's report was moderated by his Harvard classmate, renowned mathematician Professor Lawrence Markus. Prof. Markus came up with a few words about his and Qin Gong in Harvard, and gave Qin Gong earlier than he took Dr. to prove that Qin Gong was a brilliant young hero at Harvard Square. \\nThe great mathematician Hilbert raised 23 questions while looking forward to the development and direction of mathematics in the twentieth century. The 23 problems became a milestone in mathematics in the 20th century. Scholars who solve any of them are destined to remain famous, and their portraits will also be hung on the Math Ling Tobacco Court for future generations. In commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of Hilbert's presentation of these 23 questions, the American Mathematical Society specifically invited experts to write a summary of the research and progress of the 23 issues. Some issues have been resolved; some progress has been made; the report has been carefully concluded. With regard to question XVI, the report has nothing other than originally repeating the question. Truly 'no word, good flow [21]'! This problem is not that no one has worked hard, but it is too dif"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "ficult to solve even in the case of quadratic polynomials. \\nSince the 1950s, Chinese scholars, led by Qin Gong and Mr. Ye Yanqian of Nanjing University, began work on the 16th issue. Before the anti-right movement, Qin Gong and Professor Po Pu fuquanquan pioneered the method of jumping the limit ring by high-order focus; and Professor Dong Jinzhu conducted a study on the position of the limit ring. These methods and results, to this day, continue to be highly regarded and understood by anyone interested in it. After defeating the four, Qin Gong took his student Shi Songling again to challenge this famous puzzle. Because of the huge impact, we must be cautious. Professor Hua Luo Geng personally examined this work one by line, numbered and numbered and numbered. At the same time, Qin Gong and his colleagues used computer artificial intelligence to validate the cited literature, correcting a well-known mistake in the work of Soviet Academy Academician Baukin. Solidarity struggles, hard work, finally yielded sensational results in the mathematics world: The results of the former Soviet University of Moscow University Academician Petrovsky on the sixteenth issue in the case of quadratic polynomials were wrong and gave examples of four limit rings. Both the Guangming Daily [22] and China Illustrated reported specifically on the matter. \\nFour years later, Qin Gong, already more than 60, has once again strikingly taken to the rostrum. I sit below and proud of Qin Gong. I am also anxious to look forward to: what will he say? In my judgment, it should not be a comprehensive report. Because in the last discussion class before the summer vacation, when a colleague from Beijing Institute of Technology spoke about his work in this area, Qin Gong showed a lot of interest. Afterwards, he concluded: how many limit rings are there, this thing is like high jump, and soon there may be a big breakthrough. \\nWhat is this major breakthrough? \\nWhen Qin said, I was shocked: to overcome this problem, he looked at it entirely from a new field; rather than looking for new approaches or improvements to the original one. For the first time, he introduced the qualitative theory of complex differential equations, putting Hilbert XVI in a larger context. Indeed, the problem is even harder; but, on the other hand, the world is much wider. This is a ground-breaking work in the true sense: Qin Gong, with one person, has completed the presentation of the problem, the development of methods, the theory, and then completely solved the problem of Hilbert XVI in the case of quadratic polynomials. \\nI didn't have to be completely conquered by Qin's vision, courage, method, and result. Surprise, admiration, and disbelief in the face of others throughout the lecture hall were also shown. This is the goal of how many people dream, and it is the result of several generations working together. And this last leap, with almost a hideaway imagination, the power of the earth (I believe no one before Qin Gong thought of introducing qualitative theory in the complex domain). Hilbert's sixteenth question, how many Haujer let it fall; how many geniuses die. Qin Gong after so many winds and waves, after so many twists and turns, can let go with his decades-old meritorious spirit and the spirit of 'knowing it can not do it [24]'. What kind of move is this, what kind of maneuver! 'Martyrs Twilight, Impressive [25]', admittedly, to be respectable, but in the end, this shows an ideal rather than action; but when the martyrs of the twilight years, pulling three feet of sword, shouting, back, again, and again fighting the Yellow River, our descendants feel from the bottom of their hearts that are true The 'Cangshan as the sea and the blood [26]'! \\nqī\\nIn early 1987, Qin mother cerebral haemorrhage died. From a little discomfort to death, only a few hours. 'This is the biggest blow I have suffered [27].' Qin Gong said in his letter to me. Teacher mother worked around Qin Gong for many years. We are students, and from time to time feel the sincere care and love of our teachers. At this time, we can even more imagine the blow that Qin has been hit. Yeah, she was with him from 1947, from Hong Kong, to the southwest to Beijing, to the dry school; no matter how much the storm, no matter how hard the environment, she had been a partner of his mind and life, suddenly left him. In order for Qin Gong to get out of this grief as quickly as possible, Qin Gong's friends in the United States invited him to visit the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida as a visiting professor. \\nI had lived overseas for over a year. From China to the Western world, my greatest shock was not its material civilization, but its spiritual civilization. Looking back to everything that happened in my homeland, historical and realistic, I couldn't have to raise a pen to ask my beloved mentor many other questions outside the profession. \\nBefore that, Qin Gong almost never talked to me about any politics or current affairs. There are two reasons for this. First, every time he saw Qin Gong in Beijing, he was very busy, and it was difficult to have time to talk about something outside the subject. Second, after political movements, people unconsciously took 'no talk about state affairs' and self-discipline. I remember the years I stayed in school, and I was studying politics. Learning is there, newspapers and documents can be read as long as you are literate; there is no real discussion, some are irrelevant forms and cutscenes, and home remedies on how to remove limescale from the thermos. \\nQin Gong's reply to me made me feel deeply about the death of Chinese books and students since ancient times, the sense of responsibility of Peifu and the social conscience of 'not daring to forget the nation [28]'. He pointed to China's biggest problem at the time (unfortunately today): 'China's problems were mainly feudal problems, and the entire revolutionary anti-feudal was incomplete. The land was distributed to the peasants and reclaimed again. Take Xuantong out of the Zhongnanhai, and live in Lin Biao, Jiang Qing and their close comrades... Anti-feudalism is not complete and can never be the penultimate in the third world. [29]'\\nbā\\nThere has been some discussion about Qin Gong's work on relativism. For decades, Qin Gong has certainly had considerable knowledge and understanding of this. Both in Tsinghua and overseas, people have expressed their views on these work directly or implicitly about me. \\nBut precisely in this field, what I see is the Qin Gong, who is angry in book business; it is the Qin Gong, who is rather a jade and is not full of it; it is the Qin Gong who believes only the truth and does not fear authority; it is the Qin Gong who is persistent, 'Soviet independence [30]'. \\nIndeed, in my four years in Tsinghua, Qin Gong spoke more than once about some of his views on relativity. Remember once, he said to everyone, in search of truth, do not be afraid to say that you are neuropathy. In the Cultural Revolution, it was true that some people criticized the great Einstein's relativism from political purposes; while Professor Zhou Peiyuan, in his conscientious conscience and courageously defended the flag of Einstein at that time, it is inevitable that in this raging torrent of history, it will not be possible to distinguish carefully every Personal motivation and integrity, while there is a one-sided view of Qin Gong's work and simple rejection. Because of Professor Zhou Peiyuan's position in academics, his views also affect many people, including some of the leading Chinese physics scholars who have worked with Qin Gong. \\nAfter the Cultural Revolution, those who objected and amended Einstein's relativity, from all angles, positions, and motives, almost all consciously or unconsciously put the knife and gun into the store, Ma Fang Nanshan. In fact, the vast majority of these people do not have enough academic training and proficiency to discuss the topic purely academic. \\nBut Qin Gong is not the case. He was different from other people at the beginning. The real thing is 'young people, you are different [31]'. With the education of Su Buqing, MacLane and Birkhoff, he has a very solid foundation for geometric training and first-class academic research; at Zhejiang University, led by Chancellor Zhu Kezhen and Harvard University, he learned the spirit of independence that can only be said. Indeed, he is the man of Qu Yuan, 'I have both this beauty, and heavier [32]', and what he pursues is the perfection of the truth and the simple expression. \\nStep back, saying that if Qin Gong's initial work in this area bears the mark of the times and environment, people are in the river and lake, then all this will no longer exist after defeating the gangs of the four. And after the cultural revolution, people learned, 'spend the wave of brothers, meet with a smile [33]', unity to look forward, not many people will take the pain of the past from the memory again. With Qin Gong's contribution to the stability of differential equations, qualitative theory, atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb blast theory, computational physics, artificial intelligence, etc., no one will make too much more than the articles on relativity written by Qin Gong in the Cultural Revolution. \\nBut Qin Gong did not stop thinking on this subject. On the contrary, after he solved Hilbert XVI in the n=2 case, almost all of his energy was devoted to research on the subject. In the 21 years from his arrival to the United States in 1987 to his death, most of the letters he wrote and sent to me related to this. He has also reported on his work in this area on several occasions at various American universities and communicates widely with you. \\nQin once wrote in a letter to me: 'Classical physics is characterized by Galileo's temporal absolute theory... that is, any inertial reference system... measuring values of the same time... modern physics is characterized by Einstein's temporal and spatial relativism, and Einstein assumes that the speed of light is absolute... my theory is changed in Lorenz. Change on the basis of any specific power system... there A unique inertial reference system makes mivi/ √ (1-vi2), a minimum value, called the space-time reference system of the minimum total motion mass. [34]' Qin Gong gets a new invariant under the Lorenz transform, the minimum total motion mass. \\nMy understanding of Qin Gong's work on relativism is very limited, and it can even be said not. Ran Qin Gong's proof of the minimum total sports quality is very well understood. This is the goal that Qin Gong has been pursuing: deep truth, easy expression. Many people who have read this article say that this is good to understand and correct. Admittedly, mathematically correct and physical meanings are two things after all. This work has yet to be tested by time and history. \\nIt is worth noting that some people in the physical world also expressed appreciation and support for Qin Gong's work. Professor Peng Hengwu, a famous physicist, told Qin Gong that your results were right. Mr. Peng has enjoyed a high reputation in the academic community with his simple and rigorous style and outstanding contribution. Mr. Peng and Prime Minister Qin know for many years and have an objective and in-depth understanding of Qin Gong's work. For decades, Qin Gong's work, such as computational physics and postgraduate education (the defense of Professor Guan Keying, Qin Gong's first PhD student, was presided over by Mr. Peng personally). For many years, Mr. Peng is deeply uncomfortable and indignant at the fact that Qin Gong has made great contributions to the country without receiving the reward it deserves. \\nQin Gong himself is very aware of what his work in relativity will bring to himself. If in this field early fall back, in his famous mountain, in the eyes of the world, the benefit is far greater than the harm. The Chinese class has, since ancient times, attached great importance to how people evaluate them in the aftermath of the world. The so-called 'fear of repairing the name [35]' is also. Qin Gong since childhood, with his superhuman talents and widely noticed by others. At Zhejiang University, he was a genius of Chancellor Zhu Kezheng; at Harvard Square, he was a young talent under the masters of mathematics; he was a mountain ancestor of the stability and qualitative theory of the constant differential equation and the open head of the arm; in atomic bombs, hydrogen bomb explosions theoretically, he was the country The winner of the First Prize in Natural Sciences, who is a pioneer in computational physics and artificial intelligence It is also the organizer; even in Henan's May seven dry school, in that 'mountain and river breaking wind [36]', he also won the sincere admiration of the intellectuals around him with fate with the dashing spirit and keen thinking [37]. Yes, he does not need to add a relativism to his name; he does not have to question its limitations and is mistracted or slandered by the world. The last 21 years of Qin Gong's life were spent in the United States, where he was neither fameless nor difficult to live. He can quietly think about his favorite problems; can also send love on top of the landscape, a daily 'clear stream and give poetry [38]'; can also reject the world outside the body and mind, 'Garden day is fun, although the door is set and always closed [39]'; more can enjoy the fun of the day. But in my opinion, he was in the last 21 years of his life, in his academic realm when the fire of pure green, devoted to the study of relativism; at the age of 'whimsical [40]', he wrote, tirelessly, 'Danqing did not know the veteran [41]'; true Is 'people's lives have fun, Yu unique repair thought often [42].' \\nQin Gong has passed away. His discourse of relativism remains like his other work, for later generations to learn and criticize. History is ruthless, but just. It is hard to say that Qin Gong's work is not flawless or not wrong. But it's not important to me. What is important is the eternal life of the spirit of Qin Gong, the spirit that Dan is difficult to write. Mr. Chen Yinke wrote a few words on Mr. Wang Guowei's memorial most aptly expressed my view of Qin Gong's work, Qin Gong's life: 'Mr.'s writings may not be chapter; Mr.'s doctrine may be commercial. But the spirit of independence, freedom of thought, thousands of worship, with the sky and the same time, a total of three light and eternal light. [43]'\\nJiu\\nAt the Spring Festival this year, I called as usual to greet the teacher. Happy New Year, good health. When I asked about his body recently, Qin did not answer as quickly as it was in the past, and then told me about recent changes of teeth or cataract removal; rather, sloppy. I listened to my heart, and I hope he can talk more in detail. But his elderly family turned the topic and told me that, at the initiative of Professor Qian Weichang, the Chinese government is creating biographies for a group of scientists who have made great contributions to the country [44]. Qin Gong is one of them. Yeah, this is right, and it should be. In the English proverb, it is better to be late than never, saying that gratitude and penitance for people and things are better than not. \\nI did not expect this brief conversation to be the last time between students and mentors. To a large extent, I know that Qin Gong's teachers, colleagues, friends, and students are very appreciative and admired for Qin Gong's work. At the same time, on the other hand, I expressed deep dissatisfaction and sympathy for Qin Gong's secular recognition, especially in the semi-official sense. Can a man not grass, be ruthless; how can one be free?! 'Life is not about the old and poor [45]', when a person is young, can Huashan than sword, there is 'He can replace [46]' great words and winter easy water to say goodbye feat. Because he/she still has time, history will give him the opportunity to remember his history like Alexander the Great; and when Li Guang gets lost, the celery breaks, and Schumann is stationed in a psychiatric hospital, how can not let a man give heroes a grievous tear? \\nIn his last conversation with me, Qin Gong mentioned in particular that the government prepares for him. Is it not the spirit of heaven to comfort the unrest and even indignation of everyone (this kind of mood was also the most intense when the heroes died. The major events that shocked the world in China 20 years ago were an example)? There are no few of the Chinese people who have no success or failure of the history of everyone, such as the demolished man, write 'the history of the family singing, no rhyme [47]' of Sima move (his sympathetic description of Xian Yu, Li Guangna is undoubtedly the most moving chapter in the History); however, in the word prison's prerogative and feudal tradition Under education, the history of pencil books is more to become the king of Kou as the standard of rape history clown. The pursuit of science and understanding the future is a very important part of human history, and science history is in fact a horizontal history of those who have dedicated their lives and struggles. \\nIn 1992, to celebrate Qin Gong's 70th birthday, his colleagues and students held commemorative academic events in Beijing and Florida. Qin Gong's teacher and famous mathematician Professor Su Buqing gave him his poem written in Lingyin Mountain in Hangzhou to celebrate Qin Gongshu. Among them, 'the wind and rain are all over, still the first mountain in the southeast' sentence, Qin Gong's troubled life and great contribution to show the most vividly, welcome to everyone's unanimous appreciation. Yes, Qin Gong, born and completed his university studies in the ravine; when he had learned the most advanced knowledge from Harvard University, he greeted him with a burnt land of war; when he worked out the work that was still quoted today for an abandoned country, the anti-right movement cut off his left and right hands again; culture The Great Revolution made him take off a layer of skin and cut the wheat towards the blue sky in Henan facing the loess; ten years of havoc were over, and again because The superior intervened without getting the honor it deserved; and then the sudden death of the master's mother... it was really 'a lot of rain and rain.' \\nBut its achievements in differential equations, atomic bombs, hydrogen bomb blast theory, computational physics and artificial intelligence, do not live up to the reputation of the 'first mountain of southeast'. \\nQin Gong is a true student. He is not the junjie who knows the current affairs, nor is he a gentleman who is desperate. He was straightforward, he didn't know that some words should not be said, and some things could not be done. He completed his life journey with his faith and the strength of his personality. \\nWhen I learned about the sad news of the death of my beloved mentor, tears could not help to shed. It's for him, also for himself. Qin Gong was very heavy on me on that day, with great hope. It's just that I don't have that talent, and I don't have the spirit I need. Since he left Qin Gong in 1986 to overseas, more than 20 spring and autumn have already occurred. Never dare to say that they have worked hard, but at least not dare to fall lightly and play life. This is why today in sorrow still have the courage to write down the memory of the teacher. The knowledge and skills taught me by the teacher are returned as many; but Mr. that just not a, rather not bending book business will remain in his heart forever. \\nAt the funeral of Qin Gong, I offered my favorite carnations and attached to them:\\nFeng Tang Yi old, said Mr. thousands of talents, all by history\\nLi Guang-Nanfeng, Zanen Divisional Contribution, All in the Heart of Pu fuquanture Students\\nThe final part of this article is what I wrote at Stratford Shakespeare Festival.

The political economy of Marxism is also unconvincing. There is no absolute truth for everything in the world.' \\nPu jingzhi Kyung-sik said: 'Han fresh people are not used to be the same, the variety of crops cultivated is different, languages are different, so many contradictions. Some people propose a solution is the Han Han Han Han ethnic land separately, I think it should mainly solve this problem.' \\n'Why is the problem of the occupation of the Korean people who have migrated from the countryside to the city; moreover, it is not the result of contradictions of Han Han Han Cooperatives?' \\n'The plants in Yanbian area use Han workers, not the ethnic ethnic workers, so that no workers can do...'\\n'In the agricultural community of the Han Han Han ethnic group in Shenyang, Han people have reduced their income for their own interests.' \\n'Yanbian autonomy is one million yuan autonomy, because Yanbian's funding, more than 1 million yuan will be approved by the Provincial Committee. What is this autonomy?' \\n'Zhu Dehai, vice governor of Jilin Province, does not care about the lives of the masses. In 1954, there were many Korean people in Yanbian who could not eat food. The Central Committee prepared to allocate food, while Zhu Dehai stared at his eyes and blindly and said that food was enough to eat without the central dial, causing some people to eat wild vegetables without food. \\nPu jingzhi King Sik (history student), said: 'There is no patriotism with internationalism.' He also said: 'The view of the Central Sumon Railway: on the one hand, it is convenient for the Soviet Union to plunder China and Mongolia; on the other hand, at the beginning of the war, it is easy to send troops to North Korea.' \\nPu jingzhi Kyung-sik: 'All people in society have demands for democracy and freedom, some require more, some require less. In the middle of more and less, some people's demands are appropriate, that is not high and not low, so this requires this as the standard for democratic centralization. People's view of social reality, I think when they are very satisfied with social reality must be dead immediately... so ask to live forever. People's desires can never be satisfied.' 'Everyone living in society now has the absolute demands of democracy and freedom, such as the small bourgeois, peasants, the working class and so on. But as a worker, this class will not have this characteristic, but as a person, there is such a demand for absolute democracy and freedom.' 'All politics, economy, democracy, freedom and so on in our society are absurd things... Everyone has absolute democratic demands, workers fight wives, break shoes are also absolutely democratic demands...'\\nPu jingzhi Kyung-sik said: 'Production has been reduced after cooperation, farmers' income has also decreased, and cooperation is risking in.' \\nConsiders: the associations (leftist), are a means by which party members suppress protesters, saying: 'Unity's big print is just a slogan and eight sir, who suppressed people on the right. Can not obey people.' He therefore expressed dissatisfaction with the students who had joined the Solidarity Association. It also believed that 'the associations have leaders in rejecting right-wing rhetoric.' \\n'We have violated the principle of pay for work,' said. According to the law of value I found: the profits of state-owned enterprises are purely created by workers, this argument seems to be partial, including the indirect burden of consumers. Thus, the value created by one part of the producer (i.e. the work of the farmer), is transferred to the value created by another (i.e. the labour of the worker).' \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"}

In socialist countries, most people are in favour of socialism, and you are opposed by a few, of course, invincible; in capitalist societies, a few of you are in favour of socialism, and socialism cannot overcome so many people.

He studied piano with French Mr. Bauxiwen. Later writing poetry, writing publications, promoting 'General Literature' (proletarian literature), friendship with Nieer (trustworthy). He participated in the revolution in 1937 and was an early digger in Yunnan folk literature. \\nMr. Pu's father was Yuanjiang to Jinping, the largest Yi Natou toast in the Red River basin. By the 1920s, the home road fell. After graduating from the American college, he started his career in writing and started Yunnan's first literary and art publication, 'Zhaoxi'. His earlier focus on minority literature and folklore, which had always been neglected, would be invaluable. \\nI know the name of Meff, when I went to college in the 1950s to read his 1933 'Red River Frontier Situation'. His article documented some of the folk literature of ethnic minorities in the Red River region, providing valuable clues for later diggers. \\nHe later read the magazine Poetry and Prose, which he began editing in 1950. The only large literary publication in Yunnan Province at that time focused on exploring ethnic folk literature in conjunction with political tasks. Now famous Chinese and foreign Yi Narrative Poem 'Ashima' was originally published in the September 1950 issue of 'Poetry and Prose', reproduced in the November issue of the Xinhua Monthly Newspaper of the same year. It was collected by the famous Hani musician Yang Fang in 1949 in Guishan Yi people in Lunan County. This journal also published the first excavator Yang Fang's 'Sani folk song and narrative poem 'Ashima', and the Xinhua Monthly newspaper published a section on 'Ashima'. Yi writer Li Qiao recorded an epic of the Miao in Fumin County, the narrative poems of 'Green Cherry and Green Cherry High', 'The Story of Seven Sisters' and the songs of other brotherhood nationalities are also published in Poetry and Prose. The publication also published the Naxi epic 'Genesis', the ritual song 'Media Song', the love song 'Snow Mountain Love Death', with Dongba hieroglyphs. The third issue of the fourth issue (October 1951 issue), published the PUMAN love song sang by Surya, the first time the Brown folk song was printed in lead word. \\nIn folk songs, poetry and music books are one, and now some of our researchers tend to split them apart. And 'Poetry and Prose', when publishing folk songs, not only printed text, but also often attached compositions. In the notes published by the brothers folk songs, the editor proposed that the translation 'do as much as possible to 'letter, da, ya', especially can not be translated into ancient poems, nor half white'. This shows the vision of Pmev. \\nPoetry and Prose published in addition to folk poetry, but also published papers on folk literature. \\nShouson proposed 'Discover folk songs in the Yunnan plateau'. 'The ethnic minorities are singing nations, musical nations,' he said. 'Brothers from ethnic minorities not only use (it), to express emotions, decorate etiquette, but also to spread knowledge and news. Yunnan Plateau is an area where ethnic minority brothers have a large concentration, and songs are particularly rich. For the creation and creation of new culture and art, every literary worker living in Yunnan should strive to collect, study and use the song. Some papers study a certain folklore. For example, 'An overview of Yunnan folk singing and dancing and songs'. These papers opened the first more extensive study of the situation of Yunnan folk arts, and their historical significance is of no small significance. \\nOn September 24, 1987, Kunming Folk Artists Association invited me to make an academic report on the study of Thai folk literature, to talk about my thoughts and thoughts during my visit to Thailand. Pmev participated as a listener. For the first time I saw a long-established senior, he was so humble. \\nThis year, Kunming Folk Literature Integration Office invited me to select the 'Kunming Ballad' integration volume, one thing moved me. Mr. Pu sent passers-by (Zheng Shiwen), to collect the Yi song, there are long 'put the goat song' and so on; some other folk songs with compositions are handed over to the relevant departments to compile folk songs integration. These folk songs and songs were written by young people who voted for 'Poetry and Prose'. In 1957, Mr. Pu was beaten as the right. In a political storm, he would rather abandon his own manuscripts and save the manuscripts of others. He has hidden these manuscripts for decades and, as they thrive, looking for publishing opportunities for them. What kind of character is this! \\nOld life with a book sword to write spring and autumn. 'Book', revolutionary literary activities; 'sword', revolutionary armed struggle. Li Qiao wrote a praise:\\nThe pursuit of truth for the revolutionary rebellion is the Yi pioneer\\nHong Cultural Office Publications Kang generalized song is a poem Taidou\\nFang Zhongbo's poetry says:\\nLifetime grinding pen and grinding sword, Li Li Gong and speak. \\nExperience all the troubles, East, West, North and South.

He advocated the establishment of two Communist Parties, one in the North and the other in the wild, to rule in turn in order to restrain each other. He said that the key to the undemocratic nature of our country's political life is not democratic within the Party. He said that neither the Party Committee nor the deputies to the party congress of the State organ have been elected democratically. The election of the Eighth Congress of the Central Committee of the Eighth Congress is based on qualifications, and the party is only a promise, and it is not dared to raise dissent, and the leadership may change publicly. Quality translates to the enemy, 'If the bureaucracy of the leadership reaches the extreme, insist on the change, the masses take up arms to oppose When leaders, party members should participate in the masses together, pick up arms and overthrow the leadership'. \\n2. Attacks on the national policy system. The policy of attacking cadres is 'no heavy money', advocates the opening of the cadre free market, and advocates that the allocation of work should be more respectful of the cadre himself and ask for the opinions of the organs. It was also said that there was 'sectarianism' within the party and that comrades from the White Zone or of intellectuals were discriminated against within the party. He said that the leading comrades were sealed 'heroes' and that 'the regime cannot be consolidated without blocking the 'hero'. We believe that our economy has been 'messed up' by violating the 'value law' based on capitalist free competition. He told Xu Yuxing, one of the 'six professors' of right-wing economics, that China is under inflationary pressure, encouraging Xu and others to attack my financial policy. He defamed the current system of living treatment as a 'hierarchy', describing the differences in treatment as 'privileges', 'disguised benefits', arguing that 'reformists do not take'. \\n3, destroy the whole wind. He opposed the Ministry's reckoning report and some decisions of the Ministry's leadership regarding the winds within the Ministry, spreading arguments that the leadership did not resolve the wind, saying that leadership is 'privileged ideology' and no determination to reform. He stranded other right-wing elements in the Ministry, Chen Xiuying (his wife), Xue Mouhong and Cao Mian's attack leaders, and directed Xue to write two articles on capturing the wind and attacking the General Affairs Department and the head of the department, saying that the leader 'said it was one set, and it was made another set'. 'Only state officials were allowed to set fire, and no people were allowed to light up.' After 8 June, the fallacy of the chapter is still defended, such as the fixed price, not exploitation. \\nII.

In order to 'make the best use of people', Wu University appointed him in charge of the infrastructure work of Huazhong Institute of Technology. Since then, Mr. Zhang, who studied economics, was transferred to the Faculty of Engineering. 10 years of infrastructure and general affairs work, 10 years of political classes and political movements, and another 10 years of 'Cultural Revolution'. In the era of reform and opening up, Mr. Zhang is 65 years old. Mr. Zhang, 65 years old, 'What can I do at the College of Engineering? It is 15 years again. Until the end of the 90s, the 'Huazhong Institute of Technology' became 'Huazhong University of Science and Technology', which did not have the Department of Economics. By 1998, the School of Economics and Management had spelled the 'PhD Point' qualification of the Ministry of Education. Mr. was a 'doctorate' at the age of 85, and nothing more than a 'live advertisement' in the school. 50 years of consultation, a brain of wisdom was so destroyed. Huazhong Institute of Technology is today Huazhong University of Science and Technology, its predecessor is in Wuhan University, the elegant building of the middle and western, that crane chickens lies in the green mountains and cherry blossoms. \\nDuring lunch, Mr. Zhang Peigang referred to Chen Hansheng, the senior supervisor and president. Mr. Zhang's first job was at the Institute of Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Chinese Academy of Sciences. It was founded by Mr. Chen Hansheng, a Wuxi born in 1897. Mr. Chen went to the United States to study agronomy in the early 20th century, but because of color blindness, Yin and Yang learned history. He received a bachelor's degree in 1920, a master's degree from the University of Chicago in 1921, and then studied at Harvard for one year, and is considered a senior alumni of Mr. Peigang Zhang. Because he had no money to continue studying, Chen Hansheng went from the United States to Germany where the post-war economy had gone bankrupt. Two years later, in 1924, Mr. Chen received his PhD from the University of Berlin and was appointed by Mr. Cai Yuanpei as a professor at Peking University and introduced by Mr. Li Dazhao to join Communist International. Soon, Mr. Cai founded the Chinese Academy. He asked Mr. Chen to take charge of the Institute of Social Sciences and set up the Institute's rural research work. The rural survey at that time, guided by Marxist ideology, trained a group of important economists in China with socialist beliefs, such as Xue Wuqiao and Sun Yefang. In 1935, a year after Mr. Zhang joined the office, Chen Hansheng became the representative of the Communist Party of China to Communist International. Mr. Chen is not only known for his academic achievements in history, economy and other fields, but also a social activist of the Communist Party, making an important contribution to the cause of liberation of the Chinese people. \\nMr. Chen Hansheng is 107 years old this year. In the first half of the 1980s, I was privileged to study a master's degree in international politics. Being a student, at that time I felt deeply lost: Mr. Jianguo was rich and strong, with Mr. rich knowledge and experience, 50 years, since he did not have an important official position, why have no important knowledge contribution? Later it became known that the professions who were trained in Western schools and were strong nationalists. The concept was not identical to the policy of 'one-sided' (to the Soviet Union), in the early years, and coupled with the unequivocal sex, there was no big development either way. Like Mr. Zhang Peigang, Mr. Chen Hansheng is also a great teacher. During the 'Cultural Revolution' Mr. idle at home, obligatory teaching English, 'amateur disciple' peach Li full of the world. After the Cultural Revolution, Mr. taught at home, master student single soldier coaches, one class, two hours a week, including English, history and essay writing. At that time, Mr. will not forget to remind: first, imperialism will certainly bully the weak people, and my heart will not die, war is inevitable, and prepare early; second, do not forget our farmers, do not understand the farmers, do not understand China. This latter article was the subject of Mr. Zhang Peigang's statement at the seminar. Mr. Chen's birthday is the first month. In 2004 Spring Festival, Mr. 108 birthday, Premier Wen Jiabao visited the hospital and called on academics to study and summarize their academic contributions. At this time, sir can't remember even friends and family. \\nDuring lunch, Mr. Zhang Peigang also mentioned his other acquaintance, Mr. Pu shan, who died in the spring of 2003. I graduated from the mid-1980s and worked at the China Institute of Social Sciences for World Economics and Politics. At that time, Puyama was just transferred to the director of the institute, so the author was a song for it. Pushan is a graduate of Harvard Economics, two years later than Mr. Zhang Peigang, and received his PhD in 1948. Pu shan has a great knowledge of econometrics, and was also famous in the United States. Unlike Mr. Zhang, Pushan believed in communism throughout his life and believed in socialism to save China. He was already a communist when he was a student from Schumpeter in Harvard. After returning home, the socialist believer was the Foreign Secretary of Prime Minister Zhou Enlai and participated in the Panmunjom negotiations and the Bandung Conference. But the good view is not long, in 1957 Pu shan was found to be the 'right', since then to the 'Cultural Revolution', and to the reform and opening up. When he served as Director of the Institute for World Economics and Political Studies, he was already suffering from illness and difficult road. \\nMr. fame is outside. In the early years, many foreigners asked the Chinese government about the whereabouts of Pu shan, and the official answered: 'He is dead.' In the United States, many people who learned about the wisdom of Pu shan in the early years claimed that if Pushan did not return home that year, it was inevitable to receive the Nobel Prize in Economics. On a number of international occasions, I have seen Mr. style, which is by no means comparable wisdom, and also admiring the Westerners. In half a century from his return to his death, Pu shan has no famous academic achievements. Later, even though the officer was to the director, they retired for several years, and left the world after more than ten years of retirement. Pu shan's becoming 'right' is about one of the most absurd grievances in the Republic. After the reform, the 'left' of Puyama is known to people in the circle. \\nMr. Pu shan Yu is both a supervisor and a mentor. For the first time, I went abroad for the first time, so that he went to the United States for further studies, all because Mr. brought. In 1986, Mr. Pu shan took a mission to the five ASEAN countries, I served as secretary and translator. On the way back home, I feel the economic and social achievements of Singapore. On board the plane, I can't help but say, 'Capitalism is also very good.' Mr suddenly became harsher: 'Is the struggle of our generation for socialism in vain?' Speaking with Mr. Zhou Enlai, the author has an unrespectful statement immediately caused Mr. anger: 'How much does your child's family know about Premier Zhou?' Zhou Enlai selflessly worked his life for the Republic, and was a model of Pu shan life. Zhou Enlai has no children, nor Pu shan, nor has Chen Hansheng. After the reform, Pu shan was invited twice to the United States to lecture lectures, and the salary was very thick, but handed over all the money saved to the country. The last time was already in 1996. In the office of director, Puyama and her couple still share a two-bedroom set with another family, saying they want to work together with their common colleagues, until they retire into a small three-room housing. In 1998, I brought a class of Peking University graduate students who are about to study abroad to Pu shan home to 'class'. The students were shocked by seeing the situation of the 'deputy minister' cadre's family members four walls. However, although the furnishings are simple, the home is very elegant and tidy, revealing strict Western training and the taste of the children of Shanghai bankers. Last year, one of the students who attended that class received a PhD in Harvard, returned to life. If Pu shan takes Zhou Enlai as a life model, the student took Pu shan as his life model, went to visit Pushan the day before he went abroad, and the next day after the defense flew back to Beijing, but there was no chance to see him again. \\nHarvard at the beginning of the 20th century, Harvard in the middle of the 20th century, Harvard at the end of the 20th century, have the best people in our country to learn and work home. Yet what awaits their 'destiny'? From Chen Hansheng and Zhang Peigang to Pu shan, many overseas students returned to service home with a desire to serve the country, but they have lost their personal future in political movements and personnel disputes. Can they ever regret? \\nI asked Chen Hansheng, why did I go to study agronomy in that year? His answer was simple: I had to eat foreign oranges by chance, it was delicious, and wanted to let our ordinary Chinese people eat oranges of the ocean varieties. I asked him why he had joined the Communist Party, given that he had so much criticism about the policy of the Communist Party. His answer is still very simple: 'In order to defeat the warlords, let China not be bullied anymore.' In June 1989, the author asked Pu shan: 'Do you regret returning to China?' Pushan said, 'Do you think I will regret it?' He then told me a story. Friedman, the right-wing Taidou of American economics, is Pu shan's old friend in Harvard. He came to China to open a symposium in the 1980s, named Pu shan, and wanted to make a close for their fierce debate that year. At the meeting, Pu shan proudly said to Friedman, 'As soon as half a century, your knowledge has not improved at all. Has China today proved the success of socialism and proved you wrong? ' [Wuyi three press: this kind of death to face 'no regrets' lies is a woe to the nation.] \\nI think that when it was covered with the CCP flag and went to sleep safely, Pushan was unregrettable, and he devoted his life to the cause of building a strong socialist motherland. It is a true, noble Communist Party member who is in the same words and deeds. During lunch with Mr. Zhang Peigang at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, I asked Mr. Zhang the same question: 'Do you regret returning to China for half a century?' His answer was: 'How could it be? Son is not a mother and ugly!' He also said, 'The settling of personal destiny is unmanageable and is caused by the laws of social history.' Mr. Zhang made an oral statement for the young people present at the time, saying: 'Serious, but not too serious, should stop in due time; see through, can we see through, make a difference.' Horizontal batch is 'look at life'. Yu, this is the cherry blossoms emitted in the spring to make an aggressive and powerful cry. \\nWood show in the forest, the wind will break, pile out of the shore, flow will be turbulent. Chen Hansheng, Zhang Peigang, and Pu shan, their talents were overwhelmed by their brothers and crawling insect skills, and were unable to fight the laws of Chinese society. However, their life in the motherland is itself a big contribution to the university. Their noble spirit passed on the torch, so they had generations of overseas students, regardless of the future of individual treatment, returned to life. Harvard students are just one strand, one of the thousands of cherry blossoms. What spirit is that? It is a piety, is to recognize the national nation as a mother, 'son is not a mother and ugly', come back to filial avenue. Brother wall, different concepts, different ways of survival, filial heart is in common. When students adhere to the ancient teachings of 'parents, not far travel', China becomes the largest country in the world, and its civilization is widely shared, and the world is endless. \\nThe old site of the Wu University Institute of Technology that is a beautiful building that is not a spectacular cherry blossom tree, reflects today's prosperity, and tells the twists and twists behind this prosperity. Next month, the cherry blossoms will wither in the midst of rainy rain. But next spring, that cherry blossoms will bloom. \\nAttached: On the third day after writing this article, on March 13, Mr. Chen Hansheng passed away. He left a will; no memorial service nor a farewell ceremony for the remains. His home, exactly the same as I left 20 years ago, has not been 'renovated' or added a piece of furniture. Mr. old man even eats for ten years as a day, never change, see old things, think the old people, that spanning three centuries of legends drew to an end. \\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached 3] Xiao Yang: 'Zhang Wentian Hosts Anti-Right Movement at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' (Xiao Yang 'Zhang Wentian and China Diplomacy' Hong Kong Zhonghe Publishing Co., Ltd. 2012)\\nZhang Wentian has always been famous for respecting and caring for intellectuals, so the anti-right movement called 'The Socialist Revolution on the Political and Ideological Front' in 1957 was not only ideologically unprepared, but also unfit. However, because of his duties, he was still heading the anti-right movement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the midway of visiting embassies abroad. In Zhou Enlai's words, he was asked to 'handsome'. This makes Zhang Wentian assume a rather difficult role. He cannot do everything he can to protect intellectuals and mitigate the losses caused by the movement to the work of the Ministry, under the multiple pressures of a unified national deployment and the multiple pressures of the 'left-leaning' customary forces within the Ministry. \\nYi\\nWhen the anti-right movement began, Zhang Wentian was patrolling the work of our embassies in Southeast Asia. This tour, in-depth and meticulous, really solving the problem. According to Hu Qiao recalled, Zhou Enlai appreciated this, believing that none of the foreign ministry leaders before or after Zhang Wentian did so, suggesting that he 'did his work in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs more carefully and carefully.' Zhang Wentian himself has devoted himself to this kind of tour. He went abroad this time to inspect the work of embassies and consulates in India, Pakistan and other countries. While inspecting the embassy and consulate in Indonesia, the anti-right movement in the country began, and Zhou Enlai also went to call him back home to host the movement. However, he still insisted that the inspection of the embassy in Indonesia and the embassy in Myanmar had been completed. As for participating in the campaign, he did not seem anxious. \\nZhang Wentian left Beijing on February 27. It was the day when Mao Zedong made a report on internal contradictions among the people at the Supreme State Council, and returned to Beijing on July 14. In just four and a half months, the domestic situation has changed dizzy. Under the leadership of the movement leadership group chaired by Ji Pengfei, the anti-right movement has been going on for more than a month, and the meetings of the movement leadership group have been held more than 30 times. The various units within the Ministry have criticized the meetings of the right-wing elements of their own unit, and the grand auditorium of the East Building also opened all the congresses with a strong smell of gunpowder. Of course, those who were fought were intellectuals, and many of them were also quite appreciated by Zhang Wentian. For example, Pu shan, a PhD in Economics at Harvard University, attended the Security Council in 1951 as a special assistant to Wu Xiuquan and later participated in Panmunjom as a member of the negotiating team. Xue Mouhong is a graduate graduate in political science from Peking University in 1951. He studied Russian, German and Spanish in addition to English and French. Lin Zhihui, a self-taught Russian cadre, was one of the largest Russian translators in the translation room of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at that time. Cao Mianzhi, Chief of the Department of Public Information in charge of dynamic research, prepares the main task of preparing the Interim Briefing. These comrades used to reconcile two levels in 1956 when the cadre was reclassified-at that time Zhang Wentian advocated for the promotion of outstanding and low rank cadres, and all more than a dozen cadres received this advantage. Now, half of them have become the right, Pu shan has also been pulled on the stage of all the congresses. Biljilong, the same office as Pushan, was laid out in front of the stage, and the sound of 'down' under the stage was deaf. Such a development was clearly unexpected by Mr. Zhang Wentian, the host of the movement who took over the middle, and by no means welcomed him, but the situation was no longer possible to reverse. \\nWhen Zhang Wentian returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from Southeast Asia, the country's anti-right fire was burning more and more. Mao Zedong said in a speech on July 9 that 'the right will still have to dig, can not be loose, or it is a sharp storm.' On the same day, Mao Zedong also wrote a notice from the CPC Central Committee that the number of right-wing people named criticized should be increased, and the 'counter-attack' on the right academic aspect should be expanded. Then, 'Summer Situation of 1957', declaring the contradiction with the right is a contradiction between the enemy and me, an irreconcilable contradiction of the confrontational nature of you dead and living. On August 1, Mao Zedong wrote the 'Directives of the Central Committee on Further Intensifying the Fight against the Right', stressing that 'the right must be excavated in depth by various organs at the central level and at the provincial and municipal autonomous regions levels'. What about the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? A while ago, the units within the department have already struggled a large number of right-wing groups. Are they continuing to dig deep, storms and storms in accordance with the deployment to heat up the struggle, or extinguish the fire and cool down? In that situation, extinguishing a fire is impossible. But the cool thing Zhang Wentian is doing. \\nOn 24, 26 and 27 July, Zhang Wentian presided over the 34th and 35th meetings of the Movement Leadership Group of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From the current summary of the meeting minutes, Zhang Wentian stressed the following points at these meetings: right-wing material relates to the political fate of these people, to be re-examined and approved; to fully justify the criticism of the right, not pursue the motives; and to distinguish between the center-right and right. Its intention is clearly, one is to reduce the smell of gunpowder that the masses struggles to press people, and the second is to try to minimize the right. \\nThose years have come to understand what the 'chasing engine' in political movements is going on. One of the most common things, after seven chase eight, you can chase the motives of the counter-revolution. One of the main topics in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for example, is the so-called ambassador's home building. The General Services Division built an apartment building in the hutong of the newspaper room and arranged for a number of ambassadors and directors to be accommodated. The condition of the apartment building is not as good as it is now, but it is much better than the average cadres rarely had heating and separate toilet living conditions. Many people feel injustice in the revelation, and some criticize it as a privilege. If you pursue the motives of these people against the right, you can pursue the motives intentionally provoking the masses for dissatisfaction with the party. Chasing engines, as well as chasing organizations (many of the outdated opposition groups and counter-revolutionary groups are chasing out by the organizations), are all used in many movements. Since it is a political struggle, the aim is to knock down or deter political opponents, it is not necessary to put the so-called 'factual reasoning' aside, and with the simplest method of chasing the organization, you can create criminal intentions and criminal facts, and achieve the purpose of casting the crime to death.. Mao Zedong said that anti-right struggles are 'mainly political struggles' and ideological struggles do not occupy the main component. Thus, in the practical operation of each unit, the traditional method of chasing organization will be applied naturally by the movement activists passed on from generation to generation, and no one can teach. Zhang Wentian asked for full justification, not to pursue the motives. This contravenes the law of movement as a political struggle. Instead, we need to overcome considerable resistance. \\nèr\\nMore importantly, the right is less drawn. \\nWhen Zhang Wentian returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhang Wentian was not satisfied with this. For example, for the aforementioned Pu shan's decided right, I was working with Zhang Wentian, and heard several times he privately expressed his blame against the host. He asked why Cao Mian was delineated. Pan Qijun, a young clerk in the Department of Information, is also on the right-wing list. He said, 'Why is that little girl also considered the right?' However, these were all the ships, and in the climate at that time, even with Zhang Wentian's power was not good to change. He can only try to save those who have not yet been settled. The Central Committee stressed that 'piles of intellectuals,' such as certain state agencies, are the main venues for right-wing activities, demanding 'deep digging'. Zhang Wentian is actually doing the opposite. He repeatedly stressed at various meetings (ministerial leadership meetings, movement leadership group meetings), that the right should be particularly cautious. There are too many people in the various units asking for designation as the right, to study, not to define the general problem of understanding as anti-party anti-socialism, as far as possible, and some can be defined as center-right. Most of the right-wing statements have been made by some 'talent' and capable intellectuals cadres. Once they put on the right hats, not only do their political life ever cut off, we also don't use them well. Some unit leaders of the movement's leadership could not twist their minds for a moment, and Zhang Wentian also talked to them separately. Commissioner of the Asia Division Xie Shuangqiu, an old qualified underground party member, interviewed Mao Zedong in the early days of the resistance as a reporter in the 'Sweeping newspaper'. On weekdays, some literary people were accustomed to speeches, they didn't know what they said during the liberation. Some comrades in the Division wanted to classify him as the right. Not only did Zhang Wentian try to delay the decision at the meeting, but also specifically sought two comrades in charge of the leadership group of the division movement to do persuasion work: I can't plan it! Xie Shuangqiu was saved from being drawn. For Wang Shaofang, a faculty member of the Foreign Affairs School directly under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (who studied at the London School of Economics and has a history of Chinese diplomacy), Zhang Wentian also persuaded Vice Dean He Wushuang of the College: I have read the books he wrote and wrote it well. Don't draw the right, let him teach. Unfortunately, in the atmosphere that year, even Zhang Wentian did not speak, Wang Shaofang was still hard to escape doom. Chen Hansheng, deputy director of the Institute of International Relations, directly under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is a famous scholar and an old party member. According to the then Secretary of the Party Group of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he said that several party group meetings discussed, many people think Chen Hansheng should delineate the right. Although Zhang Wentian disagreed, he could not find a reason to convince everyone, but managed to drag it for a while. Finally, I thought of a way to say that Chen Hansheng was abroad for a long time and rarely underwent organized life exercise. Therefore, he should be treated as a democracy in the party. Everyone also accepted Zhang Wentian's unjustified reason, and Chen Hansheng was exempt from being drawn. A secretary of the Executive Office, working actively, is to sometimes spread some shadowless gossip and trail news, and once blindly said that Zhang Wentian's wife Liu Ying used to be someone's wife. For this reason, the branch is determined to delineate the man's right Reported to the party group meeting, Liu Yingjing, a member of the party group participating in the meeting, laughed and said that it was completely nonsense, but it was not a political issue. This man then escaped a robbery. The more it is at the final stage of finalization, the more such clashes and repetitions will be. \\nSan\\nAlthough the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also a pile of intellectuals, which should be considered to be a lively place for the right, there is little talk about the six criteria proposed by the Right Handling of Intra-People's Contradictions. There are more views on specific issues in life welfare and cadre work, such as the Ambassador's home, as mentioned above. At that time, the Chinese Communist Party was in power soon, the shortcomings of the individual totalitarian system were not as obvious as later. The enthusiasm of the general cadres and the masses was very high. Foreign Ministry cadres, including some of those designated as the right, did not make any system-level statements. Only some people in the Research Office (director is Qiao Guanhua), and the Information Division (Director Gong Peng), are somewhat different, such as Pu shan, Guan Zaihan, Li Zhaoxin, Cao Mianzhi and Xue Mouhong. Most of them had baptized the anti-Jiang democratic movement before liberation, or studied abroad, experienced the stimulation of Western democracy. Many people were familiar with Qiao Guanhua and Gong Peng, and were introduced to the Foreign Ministry for work. During the resting period, they often went to Qiao's family to gather. Qiao Guanhua and Gong Peng and his couple talked with them about heaven and earth. They were naturally encouraged, and they returned to their own unit they would follow. There is indeed a lot of rhetoric on fundamental systemic issues. For example, they raised the issue of a bipartisan system, arguing that, even if not, two parties could be established within the party in order to monitor each other. Freedom of expression, which was entirely free to express, was clear at that time (even today), and considered to be 'cutting-edge'. So once the movement moves to the right, these people are first caught by this unit. Before Zhang Wentian returned to Beijing from Southeast Asia, he was beaten into the right. In front of these speech materials, Zhang Wentian is not good enough to speak. \\nOn June 8, 1957, People's Daily editorial 'Why Is This?' Uncover the anti-right movement\\nNext is the question of Qiao Guanhua and Gong Peng. At that time, the two of them continued to work normally, and nothing was announced in the Ministry. However, many of the materials written by the research office and the Department of Public Information have involved Qiao and Gong. These people are also untouched by Joe and Gong. Many cadres in the Ministry, especially those at the level of the knowledgeable department, also feel unfair and dissatisfied with the delay in dealing with the issue of the two. Some have also made formal reminders. Gong Peng, a classmate in that year asked him Fangdai to reflect to Zhang Wentian. A deputy director of the Division also said that the Department's attitude towards the Department's movement was unclear and Zhang Wentian topped him back at the meeting. Zhang Wentian did not want to beat Qiao and Gong into the right, but he was under pressure from below. His strategy is to drag, one is to drag to cold treatment, and the second is to drag until Minister Chen Yi takes office. With Premier Zhou also serving as minister, Qiao and Gong, no matter how they deal with, cannot fail to get his approval through Premier Zhou, and doing so is tantamount to giving him a difficult problem. Premier Zhou has always taken a shunning attitude in dealing with such issues of cadres around him. In 1958, I took a record of an expansion meeting in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and as Prime Minister Zhou said at the meeting, there was someone in the counter right that someone in the Prime Minister's office had a problem, and he left the office to deal with it himself. In this way, the question of Joe and Gong was dragged to 1958. By that time, the right wing of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had been finalized, and those who wanted to decentralize the countryside had been On March 31 and April 1, Chen Yi presided over the party assembly of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Zhang Wentian's speech is still as gentle and elegant as usual. He said Qiao Guanhua has bourgeoisie democratic ideas, simple business views, and individualism, but not the right. There were mistakes during his revelation, but the reverse right began to stand correctly. He has been actively working for the Party over the years. His achievements are still relatively significant, working ability is also relatively strong, and can also work for the party in the future. Chen Yi finally spoke and adopted the approach of 'raising high high, gently lay down'. He criticized and criticized Qiao Guanhuati all the critical issues. We have to give him all the ends back. He also said that Qiao's family is Pee Dofi Club, and Qiao Guanhua is the right head of the Foreign Ministry. Once the right is turned over, he will have yellow robes. However, it is implemented to the organization, and Chen Yi also advocates not to draw the right. Qiao Guanhua (and Gong Peng), was like this. \\nHowever, the matter did not end there, but there was a dramatic development. Zhang Wentian played the role of protecting customs clearance on the issue of Qiao Guanhua. After he was wronged in 1959 Lushan, he was turned over one hundred and eighty degrees. On December 3, 1959, at the critical assembly of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a director who asked Zhang Wentian in 1957 to deal with the Qiao and Gong issue as soon as possible, and to act as a representative of his opinion, he generously criticized Zhang Wentian and Liu Ying 'the whole person' and called for a re-examination of Qiao and Gong conclusions. Qiao Guanhua himself later filled in the cadre's resume form, 'What kind of sanctions' column, and also specifically wrote that Zhang Wentian gave a disposition cloud. Whether or not the director wanted to repair it because Qiao and Gong did not fall down, or whether Qiao Guanhua had a real misunderstanding of Zhang Wentian or felt that it would be advantageous to say that his whole people had been brought down later, this could probably be counted as another movement (not the anti-right movement, but an anti-right movement), The extra 'harvest' of the day, or it can also be considered a view of people in the sports mirrors. \\nSih\\nA fight, a fight against the right. A fight, a struggle on the issue of right-wing finalization. The right of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has finally been finalized. It is not clear how many people were put on the right hat. I asked some elderly people from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said more than twenty people, some said more than 30 people, the files should prevail. Regardless of the figure, the proportion of the total number of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at that time did not exceed 1 to 1.5 per cent. This percentage is much smaller, whether compared to 550,000 right-wing nationalities representing 11 per cent of 5 million intellectuals, or with other state agencies. \\nOnce finalized, it is dealt with. According to the practice at the time, the right was sent to work as punishment. Zhang Wentian remembered that he would not forget to re-use these cadres as soon as possible, so the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not send all the right to work, but instead left some of them in the institutions, and quite a few remained in the Institute of International Relations, which later became the research backbone of the Institute. A lot of those sent to labor are also placed near around Beijing. Together with other decentralized cadres of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they are not re-education through labor, nor are they supervised labor, but are of the nature of labor exercise for general cadres. Zhang Wentian considered the situation of the right, and ordered not to allow them to 'confuse it', and they would not allow them to disclose their right-wing identity to the local masses when they delegated. Some cadres have no idea about this, and at a critical meeting of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after the 1959 Lushan Conference, using the words of local farmers, saying: 'The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is special, the right is also special; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is confidential, and the right secrecy is also secret.' In fact, the special thing is not just this one. Zhang Wentian (and Liu Ying), also criticized the branch for the right to report ideas every day. \\nLess than a year later, Zhang Wentian instructed and repeatedly urged that some of the right be redeployed back to the distribution work. He said that right-wing elements have to use anything that is a little talented. He first named Chopu Mountain. The chief cadre in the Personnel Division did not agree, saying that Pu shan has so far not condone, and still needs labor reform. Zhang Wentian said: 'In the countryside can be transformed, in the work of organs can also be transformed.' Liu Ying also said: 'Back to do brain labor is also a transformation.' \\nThere is also a conflict of thought as to whether manual labor is necessary for rehabilitation. The Department of Personnel proposes that the right-wing elements remaining in the office require at least four months of labour per year. Zhang Wentian objected, and asked: why work for four months, is not the same brain labor can be reformed? \\nIt was customary at the time that the right, even if it remained in the organ, could not do its original work, especially ideological work. The right-wing of the Institute of International Relations, who stayed at the College, no longer taught classes, did only work on materials and so on. Zhang Wentian said to He Wushuang that the right can be given lectures. When they lecture, you can also listen, they know more material, we know less. To use its professor. Under the proletarian regime, their talents can be used. At a meeting of the Party Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 28 January 1959 discussing the work of the Institute of International Relations, he further said that right-wing elements could also teach Marxismism. As a course, as long as you can tell the knowledge clearly. It is young people childish to say that right-wing classes have a bad impact. You should do thought work, do not be afraid of what the masses say. These people are national property, not waste, to create an environment where they can teach and create a friendly environment to use and transform them. \\nNeedless to say, Zhang Wentian's claims and arguments for the right to deal with the issue, as well as his own protection of the right throughout the movement, are reversed against the supreme authority and mainstream consciousness. As an alternate member of the Politburo (who was a formal member before the Eighth Congress of 1956), he was only a deputy minister (an arrangement unprecedented in the history of the People's Republic of China), and of course understands how marginalized he is already in a position to be abandoned at any time. Nevertheless, he did so in the anti-right movement. This is Zhang Wentian, that was Zhang Wentian, who then generously made statements in Lushan. \\nFive\\nMany of the features of the anti-right movement are linked to the political movements that have taken place since the founding of the State and even before it. Zhang Wentian's attitude to anti-right movements can also be confirmed by his attitude towards other movements. Only talk about the counter-movement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \\nZhang Wentian mobilized the report by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs no later than July 21, 1955, that is, one and a half months after Mao Zedong proposed to develop the fight against Hu Feng into 'expose anti-revolutionaries of all kinds of hidden hidden anti-revolutionaries'. Soon,Zhang Wentian went to Beidaihe on holiday on August 5,Back a month later,Found deviation within the Ministry movement。 Some cadres have been treated as 'counter-revolutionary' because of their ideological problems. Comrades in the leadership movement emphasized overcoming the right leaning, demanding 'continuous fighting' and 'deadlines breakthroughs'. Some units have used methods such as restricting personal freedom, searching and breaking private correspondence, and even corporal punishment. Zhang Wentian began to correct the deviation. \\nHe first said, 'the movement is left', 'it should now be against the left, not the right.' This estimate is clearly contradictory. At that time, Mao Zedong was successively approving reports from state organs Party Committee and Hebei, Shanghai and Guangdong to promote the experience of anti-right-wing ideas in the movement. The Party Committee, the State organ directly leading the movement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has changed its name to criticize the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for being behind, and many people within the Ministry share this view. In fact, in the climax of the movement, only to the right, to conceal against the left, has long become the rule. \\nZhang Wentian announced the cessation of the popular anti-rebellion movement and transferred to the ad hoc review. This is another bogey. In the reports approved by Mao Zedong, there is a constant emphasis on resolutely overcoming the tendency to not actively engage the masses and not dare to let the masses engage in ideological struggles in group meetings. Moreover, the use of mass struggles to create momentum, exert psychological pressure and coerce the object of the struggle to 'surrender' is originally the heirloom of past movements. Zhang Wentian not only stopped the form of mass struggle of the group during the campaign, but also wrote in the summary of the anti-rebellion movement: 'The problems of most cadres can be solved as long as they go through trial, and it is wrong to adopt a popular struggle.' This sentence has already been so understood, it's almost 'no exercise'. \\nThe campaign did not fight out of a counter-revolution in the end. Zhang Wentian asked to apologize for the misguided cadres and to do a good job of aftercare. Although this matter cost a lot of lip and tongue, it still persuaded the organizers of the movements of various units to do so. Many of the cadres who were mistaken were also raised in the second year. But in summarizing, some stressed that the focus was finally the correct conclusion and reluctance to admit the fact that it was wrong. Zhang Wentian insisted on writing: the movement 'although not wronged a good man, but indeed it was wrong to fight some good people'. \\nThere is also a problem with controlling the number. Zhang Wentian concluded that the error in the movement was due to 'lack of a spirit of truth', 'mistakenly believed not to exceed the central control figure, there would be no deviation', 'the initial focus of our movement, although not more than five percent of the control number, but in fact is not in line with 'The actual situation of foreign ministry cadres'. That is, can not count, can not only control the number is from. \\nHow to estimate the performance of sports is a big problem. The final draft written by the Sports Office used the standard formula that was essential at that time, and Zhang Wentian strongly disagreed. His reference is: there are also mistakes, 'it is wrong to denigrate the performance and positive effect of the campaign, or to dare not face up to the mistakes, or to exaggerate achievements by narrowing them.' Because the debate is too big, this summary has been dragged down for two years to be made. \\n1955 passed, 1957, Zhang Wentian was instructed twice to 'handsome' in the movement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, handsome is still handsome, even if this handsome is a little more handsome in this field of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it also has to pay a price. 1959 came. Zhang Wentian was liquidated, and there was certainly one of the charges: to deny the rebellious, and protect the right. To be honest, it is also true that the charges of sanctioning the right, although it should not be a crime but merit. What is inexplicable is that when Zhang Wentian received his death and the right (still alive and found whereabouts), of the Foreign Ministry were corrected, they were told that the reason they were classified as the right was the fault of Zhang Wentian. It is perhaps only the declarant himself who makes such a declaration of violation of the facts, the psychology and the pattern of movement.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached] Pu shiguang: 'I oppose this all-youthful, ignorant, dictatorship party' (1957.7.3)\\nOriginal editor's note: This article is based on the reactionary remarks of the right-wing player Pu shiguang. Pu is a major metallurgical student, 22 years old this year, a member of the Communist Youth League, whose father was fought in the land reform. In 'Ming, Fang' Zhongpu three times wrote a large print under the name of 'Youth Freedom Party' and posted a reactionary slogan. In order to destroy the Communist Party, he created the 'theory' that 'war is caused by class struggles, and class struggles are made by the Communist Party. Therefore, the elimination of war is about to eliminate class struggles and the Communist Party.' Pu shiguang said early in high school: 'Half of my head is proletarian and half is bourgeois, and the victory, can't decide. Let it develop, that victory will go over there'. After graduating from high school, he publicly said: 'If you are not admitted, I can transfer to Hong Kong to study only with my certificate of study, account,' he said. In the autumn of 1955 assigned to major metallurgical departments, he has served as a team leader, subcommittee member, deputy secretary and other positions, irresponsible in the work, out of the masses, exorbitant words and deeds, and has been unanimously criticized by the masses. After the organization of many education, still do not repent, the wrong thoughts are getting worse. On January 27, 1957, he officially informed the regiment that he called for withdrawal and then left China and went to capitalist countries in Britain and the United States. On the notice, he added: 'The purpose of my talk to you is: if you are tried in the People's Court in the future, you have to testify that I have no political problems. Our family is landlords, but it doesn't shake my economy at all because we are enlightened gentlemen.' Since then, a lot of reactionary remarks were spread among the masses. \\n[Defaming and attacking the socialist system and promoting capitalism]\\nPu shiguang believes that the socialist system has no democracy, no individual freedom, is better than the capitalist system. In depicting our society, he wrote: 'Young people will not be silent, no slave-style surrender, here is darkness... There is no happiness and freedom, I want to find a good world, the cradle of democracy'. He boasted that the capitalist system was more democratic than the socialist system. 'Scientists in the United States are valued, and they are willing to go there and go to the Soviet Union,' he said. Even Chinese students studying in the United States are free to return home.' Also said: 'Black Americans are free to leave the land. Can this say that the United States is not democratic?' He often said: 'Our society is backward, especially in science, rural backwardness, college student life, peasant life,' he said. He showed deep hatred towards the new society. 'I'm wrestling in the new environment,' he said. I identify social conditions and human relationships, which manifest the hypocrisy, selfishness, self-happiness and hatred and envy of others, attacks and shame on human vulnerability, disrespect for people and subordination of people, all this makes me not bear witness...' 'I feel compassion and resentment for such a society as labor, such as the waiters of shops and stations.' \\n[Praising the 'Three Doctrines', attempting to betray the motherland and relying on imperialism]\\nPu shiguang wrote in a letter to comrades: 'I want to stick to my own path, from fantasianism-realism-globalism'. 'Whether it is a capitalist country or a socialist country, we need young people anyway, I study science and do not ask politics,' he said. Pu shiguang has repeatedly asked to study in capitalist countries. 'I am not satisfied with the backwardness of Chinese science, I can't learn anything in China, only in the United States,' he said. I can have good conditions for study in the United States, and I can choose the major I would like to study. In the current situation (after the Hungarian events), the United States government will certainly give me everything, and after learning there, I can work for them for a few years and come back to serve the community, but not necessarily for socialism.' After that, he claimed to write a letter to the British Representative Office in China asking them to send him a flight ticket and then fly to Hong Kong and then transfer to the UK and the United States. He said: 'I had a watch, I went to Beijing, went to the Ministry of Higher Education to curse. I went to the British representative office in China to stand and asked them to take me away. I believe that world public opinion will protect me. At best, the government arrested me, but sacrificed, people always die anyway'. After the Communist Party Committee comrade talked to him, he said: 'Now I will no longer raise the matter of the country, try not to let the government catch my small braids. I'm not guilty of the government, and the government will commit me. However, do not think that it is difficult to go abroad, what a person wants to do will always achieve. I have a way. As soon as you arrive in Hong Kong, it will be free.' \\n[Stigma and curse the Communist Party, viciously attack the party]\\nHe advocated the elimination of the Communist Party, whose 'theory' was based on: 'War is caused by class struggles. And class struggles are made by the Communist Party. Therefore, the elimination of war requires the elimination of class struggles and the Communist Party to eliminate class struggles'. At a meeting in this 'Naruto, put', he shouted with arrogance: 'I am the opposition! Oppose this all-you-candid, ignorant, dictatorship party! If the party committee wants to arrest me, I'm not afraid'. When Dong Shiguang came to our school to promote fallacy, Dong Zeng-invited Pu talked Pu asked: 'Why does the Communist Party retain the rest of feudal rule in China'? Dong Answer: 'Because China's feudal society ruled for a long time.' Duo intimate abnormal. \\nPu shiguang believes that the reactionaries have a bad side and a good side; the Communist Party has a good side and a bad side. He often takes advantage of certain shortcomings in the work of the party to attack the party. Li Chengsan, a worker in the thermal labs of this school, was arrested for sabotage of the machine. Currently, there is no criminal act against the evidence materials. The judicial authorities released back to school and returned to his former post. Pu shiguang used this to misrepresent: 'This is the Communist Party's whole people.' And he said, 'Three and Five Counters is a chaos of people, a lot of people, a lot of intellectuals...' When he saw the incident of starving death in Pingle District of Guangxi Province due to bureaucratic mistakes, he said happily, 'Look! The Communist Party is not going to make a mistake yet.' Some students asked Pu shiguang: 'Why does the Communist Party have so many achievements?' 'After any revolution in history, the ruling party always has to do some good things,' he replied. \\nPu shiguang strongly supports the fallacy of right-wing Lin Xi-ling that 'the Communist Party is the root cause of the three.' He also said: 'I do not recognize that there are right-wing elements in school; if so, the right ideas are active, positive, sensitive to things, and thus contribute to social progress... Opposing the right is the most positive element, which creates an obstacle to being active.' He added: 'The Communist Party has made many mistakes in the past, and now opposition to the right is making mistakes'! When classmates actively participated in anti-right struggles, he spread out 'too much pressure! If I do not expect it to help the party to rectify the wind, it is now the wind of the whole party masses Rebutting the right's mistakes is itself another big mistake of the Party'. And said, 'If I am a ruling party, I will kill the right-wing elements.' Asked who the right-wing elements he was referring, and he refused to answer. \\n[Public support for reactionary remarks by Dong Shiguang, Lin Xiling, etc.]\\nAfter the right-wing activist Dong Shiguang came to school to speak, he wrote to Dong, expressing support for all his views, and his fallacy about the 'non-member voice' editorial department believed: 'is a reflection of the facts. Propose to cancel the party can, take it back.' He also said at the ching-off meeting: 'I am in favor of abolishing the political ideological work of the regiment. The cadres of the regiment committee can do nothing better than participate in the actual labor.' Among his classmates, he publicly supported Lin Xiling, saying, 'Theory is complete, you can't refute him at all.' When he knew that PKU right-wing Tan Tianrong organized a rampant attack on the party by the Hegel and Engels School, he said happily, 'I want to write to contact', and worked for a handful of right-wing members at Peking University, wearing the school seal in the middle, threatening to take the 'middle route' in an attempt to solicit believers. Standing Factions. To my school wrote 'warriors', the author praised the preparation, said that he 'good technique, to learn this writing technique, come and fight everything! Now I will not curse people, I will learn to curse people, now though I'm silent, but after a few years, Pu shiguang will not be silent'. \\n[Disseminating myths undermining socialist international solidarity and international solidarity of peace-loving peoples throughout the world]\\nAfter the events in Hungary, Pu shiguang publicly said: 'Yes, democracy is about to rise to fight against the government.' 'The Soviet Union should not send troops. It was wrong to use foreign troops to educate their own people. It was too cruel to suppress the good people.' He strongly supported United Nations Secretary General Hammarskjöld, who was imperialist by the United States, to Hungary, arguing that 'only then can the truth be discerned.' He said: 'Hammarskjöld is a great fighter of peace, for example, he has made a call for a ceasefire between Britain and France and Egypt is a fact,' he said. He said he would be willing to be a secretary of Kazakhstan, 'to travel all over the world to fight for world peace', agreeing with what he said in his speech: against Hungary's dissolution of the workers' committee, he said: 'The Workers' Committee is representative of the interests and will of the people and shall abolish the Hungarian Communist Party'. 'The most advanced forces in the world are neutral forces such as Yugoslavia, India and Indonesia, which really play a role in safeguarding world peace. The struggle between the two camps was man-made and it was too brutal to cause the people to death by provoking the war. You should sit down and negotiate, right, leave it, not right. I would like to look at the two social systems from a third party's standpoint.' \\n[Intransigence, refusing to repentance]\\nOn July 3, when all the classmates in the second class of Yeben II rallied to expose and repudiate Pu shiguang's anti-communist anti-socialist remarks and deeds, he was still smiling and cunning. Argued himself at the meeting: 'I forgot everything of the past. Because my question is very simple, I say much more, forget, and you actually lift me too high', and said: 'The material you expose is your logic.' Later on, he argued more brutally and unjustifiably: 'I said, what I said, did not go beyond the constitutional track, so I am not afraid, I believe my path will be brighter and more ambitious in the future. I am a forgettable man, and even if I say, there is no need to take into account what you have proposed. The human person is sacred and inviolable.' \\nOn July 5, Pu shiguang refused to participate in the whole school teacher and student staff repudiating right-wing speech and deeds meeting, I don't know where. On July 6, at the meeting of metallurgical department refuting Pu shiguang's actions and actions, he still smiley face, continued to put drugs and recalcitrant and slander the Secretary of the League After the meeting, he hated the two comrades Tan Zongqu, who rejected him at the meeting, and verbally abused them 'simply two dogs barking'. On July 8, at the second class general meeting of Yeben II, Pu shiguang took the name of the review to slander the anti-right struggle and continued to attack the party. After the meeting, they cried and falsely claimed that the classmates 'insulted his personality'. \\nPu shiguang's reactionary words and deeds have provoked the unparalleled resentment of metallurgical faculty and students, unanimously said: to fight with Pusshiguang's reactionary words and deeds in the end, not to win (Chongqing University Study Briefing No. 24, entitled Editor's), [The Office of the Propaganda Department of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China (CCP), Chongqing Municipal Committee published the first episode of the choice of right-wing speech in Chongqing Municipal/internal documents, for reference only for the reference of leaders, please do not expose and reprint' August 1957\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 4"}

            {"startYear": 1957.0, "endYear": 0, "event": "the anti-right movement began to escape because of his special relationship with Loronki. He was named by Mao Zedong under the article entitled 'The Bourgeois Direction Should Be Criticized' published by the People's Daily editorial, capped as 'a capable female general', and entered the 'Luolongji-Puxi Xixiu-the editorial department of Wen Wei Wei Wei' and 'NLD right wing system', accused of 'doing a few things for the reactionaries' The mouthpiece of rampant attacks on the proletariat for months, the direction of the newspaper was changed to the anti-communist anti-people anti-socialist direction, namely, 'Bourgeois direction', is 'the bullish bourgeois direction during handsome', and 'handsome on the handsome', the coach is Luolongki. At this time, he is interviewing in the Northeast, and Loronki is also visiting abroad. In the face of such a sudden framing, it is unacceptable. Because of 'deep feelings for the Communist Party', with this feeling, never had doubts about the CCP, and felt that since the Communist Party said it was wrong, it must be itself wrong. But where is it wrong? Yourself did not know. Want to draw boundaries with Loronki, but was attacked as 'two factions'. In the absence of a black line of 'Lorongji-Puxi Xixiu-Wen Wei Po' editorial department', the spirit completely collapsed. Under the repeated persuasion of the Communist Party Group, Pu Jie Xiu and Ua Anxiu, Wenhuo, 'confess guilt to the party to the people'. They were also forced to hand over past Diaries and letters, and use the political formula defined by the big figures above to find problems; and put the problems identified into this formula to illustrate their fault. Under the 'Party is absolutely right, wrong is its own' mode of thinking, write 'check' once and again, and sincerely review himself in accordance with the requirements of the 'Party' and 'expose' Loronki. Since then, a number of private letters from Loronki have also been published. On the day after the publication of the People's Daily editorial, 'The Bourgeois Direction of Wenhubo', at a journalistic symposium, was forced to read some of the contents of Loronki's private message, who lived in love and cohabitation for 10 years, and used the word of the bed as 'heavy bomb'. At the meeting held in Beijing's Nanheyan Street CPPCC Cultural Club called 'The Sixth Enlargement Symposium of the NLD Central Committee', the last one came to power, holding a speech entitled 'Loronki is a wolf dressed only in sheepskin', revealing that 'Loronki's family origins are the landlords themselves. During the land revolution, his home in Anfu, Jiangxi, was liquidated by the Communist Party, his parents died, and the levirate who chaired the housework was also criticized. The Lorong gene was raised by levirates at a young age, and so far monthly remittances to support the levirate and his nephew can be seen on this matter. The most powerful exclamation is: 'Lorongi was not dead about US imperialism after his liberation. In his home, Zhang Dongsun had collaborated with the third class agent of the United States, too unscrupulous. And he himself always wanted to have a relationship with America's top agents.' For 'ten years of close friends,' the ultimatum is: 'Let the relationship of this so-called close friend be thrown into the pit! Again, I warn Loronki that you never want to take advantage of me anymore! ... Loronki's anti-socialist conspiracy was consistent, saying his bones burned ash and could not find anti-socialist conspiracies. In fact, his bones burned ash, the rest of the ash residue were also anti-socialist. For example, Loronki was not satisfied with the pair of red shoes he bought, 'exposing his deep hatred of the Communist Party'; a fire to the attendant was that he was 'fierce to the working people as wolves.' Therefore, 'look far from Liu Qingyang, near puxi xixiu' testimonials, and stand as a model, but also failed to climb out of the mud of the right. For this, Lorongki is outraged: 'Pu xixiu for his own life, do not hesitate to want me to die! Taking the word of the bed also as a political speech, getting to the conference to expose it is a fatal one! No wonder the old husband Kong said, 'Women and villains are difficult to raise. '' 'Pu xixiu betrayed me, but kept the status of a member of the CPPCC National Committee, or drew the right, why?' Seven of the 10 reporters in the Beijing office of Wenhui were classified as right-wing elements, and the remaining three were internal control elements, and the hat was held in the hands of the masses."},

At that time, the aunt was quite powerful, I also helped turn the box upside down to find materials. Mother herself was also exposed. I asked some old friends who exposed my mother in that year, saying that at that time did you think Pu xixiu was a real opposition party or forced to do it? No one can answer. My mother once wanted to fight with death. I was sent home by the party organization, and silently noticed that her sleeping pills should not eat much. The mother's heart dripped blood, but could not talk, she still came over, but she and Loronki had no contact. In 1965, Loronki passed away, I don't know if she knew.

Will it stick to the belief in joining the party after being classified as the right? Some say it's 'foolish'. But I understand that this doesn't mean that generation's dedication to the ideals that have been pursued for life?' \\nPu xixiu (1910-1970), a famous female reporter from the Republic of the Republic of China, has worked in the New People's Daily and Hong Kong Wen Wei Po, writing a lot of progress reports that were sensational across the country at that time. She believes that a journalist's role is to 'monitor the progress of society' and to exercise himself and has always been at the forefront of the struggle for democracy. In 1946, Pu xixiu was severely beaten by KMT agents during the shocked 'Shimonoseki incident'. In 1948, the Kuomintang arrested her in prison on suspicion of 'Communist Party'. Mao Zedong once called her a 'reporter who sat in a class room' and was received by Mao Zedong while attending the opening ceremony. In 1957, Pu xixiu was mistaken as the right. The charges included 'turning Wen Wei Wei Bao' into a reactionary propaganda tool together with Luolongji and Xu Zhucheng,' and 'conspiracy to write articles to defend the 'Party World' fallacy of Chu Anping.' As a result, Pu xixiu ended his career as a journalist, depression became a disease in 1970. Death. In 1980, the Party Central Committee made a decision to correct Pu xixiu's misdesignation as the right, restoring her honor. \\n[Pre-interview: At the end of the 20th century, Puxiu's daughter Yuan Donglin and son Yuan Shijie were able to collect most of the articles in his mother's life into a book, edited as 'Pu xixiu's journalist career tracing' came out. 'Yipu Xixiu' written by Pu xixiu's family and friends from different angles was also published. Yuan Donglin wrote 'Pu xixiu: this life infinite' also met with readers, which made Yuan Donglin's heart a little comfort.] \\nYuan Donglin has kept two yellowish medical records. On the page of the hospital number 112936, the medical records remember: 'On December 10, 1968, at 10 a.m., today, the ward all rest rest guards held a general meeting, and wrote a circular order to criticize the great right, Puxi Xixiu, order discharge in the afternoon.' At that time, Puxi Xixiu had suffered from rectal cancer, and his condition worsened, but had been expelled from hospital several times. On April 23, 1970, Puxi Xixiu woke up after struggling in the corridor of the emergency room of the People's Hospital of Beiji, she said, 'No trouble.' She unplugged the oxygen tube, carrying a heavy political burden, suffering from mental and sickness, she walked alone and sadly, without a loved one. At that time, the children were in the field, and contacts were mostly broken. Someone came to the 80s of the last century to inquire about the whereabouts of Pu xixiu. Even the former reporter Peng Zigang, who fought side by side with her, went to visit Puxi when he was terminally ill, and later did not recall with bitterness, 'She and me were the same victims in 1957. If the leader had not let me go to Beijing hospital, I wouldn't dare to go.' \\nThose great things are left behind. Pu xixiu is a famous female journalist from the Republic of China. She was full of patriotic passion and responsibility, as bad as vengeance, wrote and published a large number of articles, including no shortage of 'trouble' news, was hailed as 'brave and persistent, daring short soldiers to meet the news warriors'. In December 1941, Hong Kong's emergency evacuation, many democratic people failed to evacuate in time. However, Mrs. Kong Xiangxi Song Oiling actually flew to Chongqing with a foreign dog from Hong Kong. Puxi corrected his visit to the airport, and captured such news, how could it be published under the strict inspection system of the Kuomintang at that time. Pu xixiu tried out her way. She used a little bit by one to write, writing Mrs. Kong to Chongqing first, and then wrote several messages of dairy dogs in Chongqing suddenly--These messages sent out, checked together and published, plus a clever title, so sensation of the country's The news was born, and public opinion was wouting for it. \\nIn 1957, Pu xixiu, famous for the 'left' reporter, suddenly became the bourgeois great right. The editorial points out Pu xixiu, who was then deputy editor of Wenhui Po, said that she was 'a capable female general,' and said, 'Lorongji-Puxi Xixiu-the editorial office of Wen Wei Po, is such a NLD right-wing system in Wen Wei Po.' Famous cartoonist Hua Junwu published an Yingjing comic: a woman hid her face in the pipa, 'Lorongki stand' on the Pipa, narration is 'Pu xixiu 'self-examination'. \\nIn June 1980, the Party Central Committee restored its reputation for Puxi repair, cartoonist Hua Junwu sent a late 'letter of apology': 'I have painted a comic satirical about her. This comic now recognizes it is wrong, and it is not appropriate. For this time, I had to apologize to her family. 'Up.' In 1997, Hua Junwu published an article 'Evil Zhengzeming' again apologized for this, 'I painted this painting, entitled 'I hold the lute half cover', is an unserious attitude towards Pu xixiu, can also be said to be a humiliating insult.' Hua Junwu recalled that at that time Kang Sheng said that his comic book was good, he was still very happy, but Deng Xiaoping said after watching, don't draw such cartoons in the future. \\nDry gehua in order to Yubo, Puxi Xixiu has long been in the midst of a disease. In 1957, in MadeIn's political storm, Pu Xixixiu repeatedly 'reviewed' herself, she was forced to expose Loronki, even under pressure from relatives and friends, to hand over the diary and personal letters that he had over the years to prove that she had no opposition. And she and Loronki 'ten years of closest friend relationship', so grace cut off. Pu xixiu also carried a heavy psychological burden. When she was seriously ill, the NLD Central Committee sent a person to see her, and her only request at that time was to return more than a dozen personal letters from Rolongi to her, which she was very grateful. \\nFrom the beginning to the end, Pu xixiu never complained about the Communist Party, always believed Chairman Mao. Even when her life was in danger, she also wrote an 'autobiography' to the party, and looked forward to giving a fair assessment of history. She copied a lot of Mao Zedong's articles and poems in a period of time. in order to obtain spiritual support. \\nDue to time, I can only talk about some fragments of my mother. Until today, why President Mao Zedong's name is still a mystery. It was in the summer of 1957, I went to 4th grade college. At that time, the classmates took a copy of the China Youth Daily to show me, and published the news and photos of Pu xixiu, criticizing the great right, and I was scared and felt that my head was big. Maiang was beaten by agents, and was jailed by the KMT prison, almost sacrificed, how could it be anti-party? I really can't figure it out. But there is one in my mind, believing in the Party, listening to the Party's words, it is certainly that the mother has a problem in which aspect. I said that she was an intellectualist from the old society and that she was educated to be bourgeois, so she has a bourgeois news view. \\nGood guys and bad guys\\nI think she is a real journalist, and she has taken a lot of ways to deal with KMT's censorship. She was sensitive to news, but that sensitivity was later suppressed. \\nThe best time was from the war of anti-Japanese resistance to the pre-liberation. In her career as a journalist, she was an interview with the Republican Republic about the Political Consultative Conference. In January 1946, the National Government convened a political consultation, which was the product of the republican talks. Niang interviewed 38 CPPCC representatives at that time. At that time, one of the themes of the debate was the priority between political democratization and the nationalization of the army, and 38 representatives each expressed their views on this. The most difficult of delegates to visit is KMT Foreign Minister Wang Shijie. Because he is cautious and is said to work more than 16 hours a day. The VIP had to meet her three times, but asked her not to write his name. The flexible and witty mother promised to make each other feel relaxed and enjoyable during the visit. The mother is a trustworthy person who only wrote 'a representative' in the interview note, but since the other delegates visited have a name and a pair of the general list, they know who 'a representative' is. At that time, someone praised the mother, saying that she made a seasoned diplomat the defeat of her uncrowned king, but only faint said: 'This can only be considered a wise man, and there will be a failure.' Niang is relatively simple in politics. After the political turmoil, the mother finally realized his life: 'At that time, he was a journalist, running and running away, mixed in the political vortex, but did not understand politics.' \\nDuring the Chongqing period, Niang, after a slow contrast, became increasingly inclined to the Communist Party. Like a child, she often says good and bad guys. It is outrageous that the KMT is corrupt, does not resist Japan, engage in friction, not democracy, no freedom, and do bad things. And what the Communist Party speaks the truth, justifies it, has the means, caring for people, and doing good things. She is willing to stand on the side of good guys to fight the bad guys. And the good man's everything she believes. Sanaunt Pu Anxiu also had an impact on her. Three aunts went to Yan'an during the war, and later married Peng Dehuai. Niang arrived in Chongqing, and the three aunts introduced her and the people of the Eighth Route Army Office through their relationship. Zhou Enlai was very concerned about Niang. Niang often went to Zhou Gongdae to bring Zhou Enlai's view of the situation back to the newspaper hall. Sometimes the Xinhua Daily could not board things, he discussed with the maiang in the New People's Newspaper. \\nNiang was often followed by agents behind that time. Later, Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu evacuated from Nanjing respectively, Niang was particularly sad. Niang did not want to go at two o'clock in the evening at the CPC representative base in Meiyuan Xincun, Nanjing. He was reluctant to go. Later, Zhou Enlai encouraged her. You still read more books. She was so busy as a journalist at that time. By the time Dong Biwu retreated, the maiang cried and was persuaded to explain that she remained in the KMT ruling area, more than she had to play in Yan'an. \\nFrom journalists to 'old news' reporters\\nIn 1949, Maiang entered the new society with a mixed feeling of the Kuomintang opposition and the love and trust of the Communist Party. Just liberated when the mother was particularly happy, as if bathing in the sun all day, it was full of heart singing. Look at the picture she took when she was liberated, she was fat. It must be a comfortable mood. This is also her favorite photo. \\nNiang attended the first CPPCC meeting convened by the Communist Party of China and attended as a freelancer representative. After liberation, she went to Wen Wei Bao, for intellectuals. Niang's connections are particularly wide, she is particularly enthusiastic about anything. She wants to hang up a phone call to call, and after liberation, want to find the Minister of Public Information of China, said to find, or have no hierarchical concept. My friend said that at that moment they all felt how the nose of Puxi Xiu Run Exclusive News was still so spiritual, in fact, the meaning was that the situation had changed. \\nShe quickly fell into distress. At that time all political news had to use the Xinhua News Agency's text, she didn't know how she should play a role at that time, because she was famous for her exclusive news and interviews. She failed to join the party and had a sense of political loss. She also hoped that the party would strengthen the leadership of Wen Wei Po's office in Beijing because she felt too free in her office in Beijing. But she was still a liberal in her bones. The freedom is not about being unorganized and undisciplined, but rather requires independent thinking, to be truly me with an independent personality. \\nIn the early 1960s, it was a special era of 'Don't forget class struggle'. Class struggle to speak day, month and month, year talk. It happened to ask a landlord's nanny, and we all advised her to dismiss her quickly. So she said, she is not a landlord now, and the land is gone. Why can't she eat with her own labor? Later she was forced to dismiss her under pressure. All the moral bottom line at that time was the class position, otherwise it would be morally classified as a bunch of shit that was not ashamed of human beings, but there was no string in the head. Mother accepted this, 'consciousness' slow. Remember to criticize films such as 'Early Spring February', 'Northern Jiangnan', 'Stage Sisters' and 'Sisters of the Stage'. She repeatedly said to me that she does not have this critical level of criticism, she has these criticized humanitarian ideas. In the early 1950s, in the successive criticisms of the 'martial training biography', 'secret history of the Qing Palace', Hu Shi, Yu Pingbo, Liang Sicheng, approved Ding Ling and Chen Qi-xia. Until anti-Hu Feng, I later specifically investigated Wen Wei Bai's signature critical articles for that period. \\nNiang used to be a very cheerful person. After being beaten as the right, she thought very stuffy, smoking more and more powerful, she used to write brush words to calm her emotions. In 1959, the Central Committee picked a cap for a part of the right, including Niang, who was assigned to the CPPCC Committee on Literature and History Research to edit the 'Selection of Literary and Historical Materials'. Niang said profoundly: 'The journalist should not become a journalist, and the mother again became a 'old news' reporter.' \\nReunion with history\\nThe book 'Past Is Not Like Tobacco' is very influential at home and abroad, and there are some young scholars questioning Maiang's behavior to expose Lorongi. They do not understand that a person's words and deeds cannot be separated from society at the time. Those who have gone through that history know that it is by no means a simple question of being 'threatened', 'persecuted' and 'confessed'. In that era, the authority of the Party was very high, and the girl was so convinced of the party. When the organization and the surrounding masses all said you were 'wrong', they could only find 'wrong' themselves. 'When she was tortured and tortured and tortured, she might just feel like she was wronged and misunderstood,' an old man in the press said. \\nIn 1957, after Mao Zedong ordered the name of Lorongji and Niang, the Assembly will begin to fight the lady. Relatives also forced her to come up with the Diary, find materials, help the lady on the line, expose Lorongi. Some of the material is not her original words, but the result of everyone's 'help'. At that time, the aunt was quite powerful, I also helped turn the box upside down to find materials. Mother herself was also exposed. I asked some old friends who exposed my mother in that year, saying that at that time did you think Pu xixiu was a real opposition party or forced to do it? No one can answer. My mother once wanted to fight with death. I was sent home by the party organization, and silently noticed that her sleeping pills should not eat much. The mother's heart dripped blood, but could not talk, she still came over, but she and Loronki had no contact. In 1965, Loronki passed away, I don't know if she knew. She had rectal cancer herself at that time, with few sources of information. \\nFor this history, I feel that there is an article that speaks my heart: 'They all have lost their lives or aspire to a people's new China, and some are mistaken as the right is precisely the ideal. When they were classified as an alternative, their words and actions had to meet the political, legal, wrong and moral standards of the time, and had to do something that could be said not to be done or inappropriate today.' \\nNiangkai's memorial service was very late. Due to the influence of the 'two things', the implementation of the policy is still difficult. The eulogy has also been modified only after several changes. We proposed to ask Kang Keqing, vice-chairman of the CPPCC, to preside over. My friend said that when it was the most powerful anti-right, Kang Keqing insisted that Pu xixiu was not the right party. \\nThis wish was reached. On March 19, 1981, Niang's memorial service was held in the second meeting room of the CPPCC Auditorium. My friends of journalists came, unlike opening a memorial service. Everyone is happy, don't revisit for a long time, I think, oh, how did Puxiu go, how did you go without her?! \\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attachment 2】Zhu Zheng: From Journalist to 'Old News Reporter'-Pu xixiu Biography (Book House, No. 6, 2001)\\nFirst, what is the difficult thing at an early age\\nOn October 29, 1910, Pu xixiu was born in Jiading County, Jiangsu Province, Yongkang Bridge (now Shanghai). His father, Pu Youwu, was a book reader, and was a small official breadwinner outside. Mother Huang Anxiu is illiterate. Outside of domestic chores, almost every night we have to do needlework until late at night, earning a few money. You can imagine that the home situation is quite difficult. \\nAt this time, the end of the Qing Dynasty was approaching. When she was under age, the Wuchang uprising broke out. Then, the Republic of China was established. Around the first year of the Republic of China \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), her father served as an accounting clerk at the Ministry of Communications in Beijing. \\nIn 1917, the mother took her and her sister to Beijing, together with her father. In Beijing, she added her brother Tongxiu and her sister Anxiu. It is not easy for a small employee to pay for a family of six. In order to make some money, her father once went to Tangshan and friends to open a mine, and soon ended with a failure. He had to exert his home estate code out to fill the deficit. \\nSoon after moving to Beijing, Pu xixiu was enrolled in the primary school affiliated to Beijing Women's Normal University (referred to as female attached primary). School in Xidan South East blacksmith alley, not far from the six exit of Xichang An Street where she lives. In her classmates, she was a good friend with Chen, who was one year older than her from Suzhou, and this friendship continued until their old age. Graduated from primary school, and they were enrolled in secondary schools attached to the Women's Normal University (referred to as female secondary schools). At that time, they went to science classes in high school. From the girl to become a girl, there are a lot of knowledge to talk quietly. \\nAfter completing the first grade of high school, Puxi dropped out of school because of economic difficulties. It's not a matter to be idle at home. She wants to study fine arts. In addition to getting her to Jinghua Academy of Fine Arts, his father also asked a friend of painter to teach her. She painted a fan that was still in place, and she can see that her genius in this area is high. \\nIn the second year of painting, it happened that one of her sister's classmates had to leave Beijing. The man in the position of the female attached little school to find someone to replace, he looked for Xixiu. So she taught while continuing to learn her painting. The female junior is a national primary school. She just went to pay 50 yuan a month, increasing to 55 yuan in the second year. She achieved the longing for economic independence, this year she was 17 years old. The 50 silver dollar is not a small number, but she uses very little, saves her money and prepares for college exams. \\nIn the summer of 1929, Chen of the same class graduated from high school and went to college. Pu xixiu very envy, he also took the diploma from the Jinghua Art School to try to apply for the female teacher college. Originally, he studied science. I stopped for two years in the middle. I was afraid that it would not be easy to test, he went to the Department of Chinese Literature, and actually went to the study. Chen Kaotou, Tianjin Nankai University, Department of Mathematics. Two friends are away from one place, communication is still constant. \\nIt's a pleasure to go to college. But at that time the mother died. At that time, his father worked alone in Nanjing. Just rely on her sister to repair and take charge of the lives of several sisters, and the economy is very strained. Xixiu had to teach primary schools while attending university. She was tired of having a very serious stomach disease. Since the second year of college, she resigned from her primary school and only taught a few hours in the middle school. \\nIn college, the vision of reading has been broadened. In the National News Weekly, reports of some Communist Party activities in Jiangxi have been seen from time to time, giving her unspeakable excitement and longing. She is unhappy with this society and hopes to change. \\nBecause of her friend's introduction, she was in love with Yuan Ziying, a teacher of secondary school. In 1932, the university graduated a year later, and they got married. Chen later recalled: 'Shortly after her marriage, Xixiu wrote to me about her love after 1510. I felt her happiness at that time, but also felt her trust in me, and treated me as a good friend who can feel happy for her happiness.' \\nFrom primary school to university, Puxiu went to girls' schools, and had not studied with boys. Boys and girls are always easy to feel favourably for the first opposite sex who has the opportunity to get close to themselves. It is not easy to spot differences and differences in character and interests in not too long. Or more so, in love is not going to think about this aspect at all. Having to wait until married, learn more about each other, read more and compare, you may feel that the other person is not ideal. This is the word, but at this time, Puxi Xixiu is immersed in a sense of happiness. At the end of 1933, their daughter, Winter Forest, was born. \\nThat is, in that year, she graduated from college and became a national language teacher at the private Zhicheng High School. At that time, her sister had already gone to Germany to study abroad, and his brother and sister lived in Xixiu's home. \\nThat is, before and after this, Yuan Ziying worked at the Shenzhou Guoguang News Agency. Shenzhou Guoguang was originally a photocopy of the monumental edition of calligraphy and calligraphy of the old publishing house, due to the influence of the new cultural movement, this kind of books slack, gradually unsustainable. In 1930, Chen Mingshu financed 400,000 yuan to take over, to his 'turn of Mo Tan' (Chen language), Wang Lixi presided. Wang suggested: 'After taking over, the 'Shenzhou' needs to translate communist books, print progressive world literary works, create various periodical journals, and make extensive use of left-wing writers' works to support writers financially.' Chen completely accepted. Since then, 'Shenzhou' is new. Lu Xun's translation of Jacob Wulev's novel 'October' reflecting the October revolution in Russia was published at the Shenzhou Guoguang News Agency. \\nChen Mingshu said: 'After Wang went to 'Shenzhou', he took up the position of editor-in-chief, and 'recruitment', gathered many friends he met in Beiping, Shanghai, Japan, and came to 'Shenzhou' for specific work, and raised cultural personalities in Shanghai to serve as special editor. Yuan Zi-ying entered the Shenzhou Guoguang News Agency about his direct or indirect relationship with Wang Lixi, and was the manager of Beiping Branch. \\nAs Chen Mingshu said, this Shenzhou Guoguang News Agency 'although I personally invested in taking over, it was always part of the collective cause of the 19th Route Army.' When the 19th Route Army announced the formation of an anti-Chiang People's Revolutionary Government of the People's Republic of China in Fujian on November 22, 1933, the Shenzhou Guoguang News Agency was immediately hit. On 30 November, the general distribution office in the Shanghai Concession was destroyed by thugs, all foreign branches were closed and their books were confiscated and burned. Yuan Ziying was also wanted for this reason. He rushed out and fled to Jinan as a substitute teacher. Later, his father introduced to work at the Land Surveying Bureau of the Nanjing Staff Headquarters. \\nPu xixiu is not willing to go to Nanjing. She cannot be a housewife dependent on her husband, but she wants to find a job in Nanjing, but there is no way to do it. So she stayed in Beiping. In the fall of 1935, her son was distinguished. She took two children, and her sister, who was responsible for the life of the family. \\nIn these years, Peking Ping was not a quiet place to block either. In 1931, Japan occupied the Northeast and founded the pseudo-Manchuria State. In 1933, the river was occupied again. And the Tanggu Agreement signed by China and Japan has allocated a large area of land for the free access of Japanese troops, facilitating Japan's further control over the whole of North China. In July 1935, he Yingqin's reply to the Japanese party's 'juxue book' by Meijiro Umezu, fully promised that the Japanese side demanded that the Chinese party and government organs in Hebei be abolished, the Chinese army stationed in Hebei, the replacement of Chinese military and political officials who were dissatisfied with Japan, and banned all anti-Japanese activities. At this emergency juncture of national death, the 'One Two Nine' campaign erupted in Beiping. Thousands of students marched under the leadership of the Communist Party, shouting the slogan 'Stop Civil War, Unite Out' and were hit by the horses and water dragons. Pu xixiu's sympathy on the student side. Urayasu who went to high school in women's secondary school actively participated in the campaign. \\nIt is too tired to teach two children again. She is getting less physical. In 1936, Yuan Ziying took her and her children to Nanjing. My sister was admitted to the Normal University and stayed in Beiping. My brother went to Nanjing with his father who worked in Nanjing. \\nPu xixiu can not get used to the life of a housewife, looking for a job. She passed many people, walked many doors, and had no results. One day, she saw in the advertising board in the New People newspaper that a real estate company was recruiting female staff, and she hurried to take the test. The exam is exactly what she is thinking about women's careers day and night, and she has a lot to say. She knew she was not bad, she was fully convinced that she would be able to do so, but she did not accept it. The owner of the real estate company told her: 'We don't have to have married female staff here. Your article is well written, I would like to introduce you to the New People.' In this way, Pu Xi learned the New People's Newspaper, founded and hosted by Chen Mingde. \\nShe first did the distribution work and then moved to the Advertising Section. She has no interest in these jobs, but a job that is easy to find, still have to do it well, and submit contributions to the supplement when available. \\nIt did so for a few months, and a chance came up unexpectedly. On April 29, 1937, the Capital Women's Academic Research Association will hold the anniversary meeting in Liuhui Xie next to Zhongshan Mausoleum. The Xinmin Daily knew the matter temporarily and decided to report it. However, the reporters were out and could not send people. Chen Mingde had no other way to think about, and decided to send Puxi to 'save the place'. She did not humiliate the mission, 'salvation' success. Her report 'Liuhuei Xi-Pan Festival-Anniversaries of the Women's Academic Symposium Anniversary' was published in the newspaper on May 2. Years later, Chen Mingde and Deng Jixing also mentioned this report in a memorial article to Pu xixiu, saying it was 'a smooth wash of writing and writing, attracted readers and won the praise of their peers.' Impressions are visible. This success resulted in the transfer of her from the Advertising Section to the editorial office and became the first female journalist in New People. As Mausi said to the king of the plains, it stands out from the capsules of the cones. Pu xixiu stands out like this. \\nAble Journalists (Part 1)-In the War of Anti-Japanese War\\nOn July 7, 1937, the Lugou Bridge Incident broke out, history entered the period of the Anti-Japanese War. Shanghai also became the battlefield on August 13. Then Nanjing was also bombed by enemy aircraft. The fighting is getting closer. On November 27, the Xinmin newspaper released the last newspaper in Nanjing, and shipped machinery and paper to Chongqing. Reports were not resumed in Chongqing until January 15, 1938. \\nPu xixiu did not accompany the newspaper. She had two children dragged and could not walk away. Moreover, she wants to do more direct anti-Japanese work and want to go on the front line. She went to the Red Cross ambulance training course without her family for two weeks, and she still did not get on the front line. Instead, sister Anxiu and his brother Tongxiu went to Yan'an. \\nIn the midst of this desolate horse, Xixiu family lived in Hangzhou for some days, and went to Wuhan for some days. She took two children to Chongqing in the summer of 1938. A few months later, Yuan Ziying and his parents also came to Chongqing. Xixiu handed the children to their grandmother and went back to work in January 1939 and served as head of the interview department. Yuan Ziying found a secretary at the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Office of the Ministry of Economy. So they created a relatively stable life in Chongqing. \\nAt that time, the theme of the newspaper was war, which was how to inspire, mobilize manpower and strive for victory. Although Chongqing is behind, it is linked to war everywhere, regardless of political economy, academic culture, until social life. The interviews that Pu xixiu made at this time also focused on the theme of war. She reported on several symposia of the National Diplomatic Association. Wang Lixi, who has just returned from Britain, spoke about the situation of various countries 'assistance to China and the future of victory in the war of resistance. Guo Moruo analyzed the enmity and said that Japan's financial bosses resisted war and warlords were difficult to ride, and a major political earthquake would surely occur. She also reported on activities to relieve the wounded and some anti-Japanese drama performances. \\nFrom her reports, it can be seen how this arduous and great war against Japan was fought. There are some, which can be said to have high historical value. For example, from the air defensive post, published in the newspaper on October 8, 1941, one can see the scene: 'The old Sentinel was laid out as a lookout, a team of nine men, a sentry commander, six sentinels, a gang. Some might think that the anti-aircraft posts would use a complex set of gauges, but here except for a telephone and a telescope at the whistle, they all looked with the naked eye, their ears listen, and train very well. Although the Chinese are poor in material conditions, his wisdom overcomes everything. 'Directioner' was originally a monitoring whistle something, here the substitutes for the local map, with gravel paved numbers, like a big day regulations, at a glance, use this to 'orientation'. Report it from the phone, nothing wrong. Foreigners have seen, marvel at the greatness of China, they have no command under such rudimentary equipment.' Hereafter readers can know from here: the conditions under which China will prevail over its strong enemy. \\nAs Roman historian Tacitus said: 'Here is battle and trauma, there is a bathhouse and a feast.' Wouldn't China at that time, Chongqing at that time, be exactly the same? Pu xixiu's pen wrote both aspects. She passionates the militants of the fighting, and at the same time ruthlessly lashed the despicable high-ranking officials. Kong Xiangxi, then vice-president of the Executive Council and Minister of Finance, was the representative of corrupt forces. Puxi wrote several manuscripts that expose him. Here's only one thing about a plane carrying a foreign dog. Wang Yunsheng and Cao Gubing's Old Big Communiqué from 1926 to 1949 said this: 'When the Pacific War broke out on December 8, 1941, Hu Zheng fell into Hong Kong. When the situation was tense, Wang Yunsheng went to Chen Bulei, please try to save the Hu out. Chen Buleixuan told Wang Yunsheng that 'Chairman Jiang has known Hong Kong and let Mr. Hu come out by airplan' Yunyun as soon as possible. The Big Communiqué sent people to the Coral Dam Airport waiting to meet. December 9 (quoted by: when the 10th), by Hong Kong flying the last plane landed in the coral dam, the door opened, and no Hu Zheng, but see a large number of cages, several foreign dogs and mother from the plane, by Miss Kong II in a man's suit transported away. \\nOn that day, Pu xixiu was also at the airport and witnessed the scene. She recalled in the 'Interview Decade,' she recalled: 'When the fighting in the Pacific came up and Hong Kong emergency evacuation, then I was very attentive to the airport bound to bring some VIP people, and went to wait early in the morning at the airport, and indeed saw Mrs. Sun and Mrs. Kong all come together. Mr. Wang Yunwu is also looking at his home that is about to fall. Genus. Can't think of a few into a few, people did not come, suddenly a few foreign dogs down the plane. That is, of course, good news. However, under the strict inspection system at that time, how such information was published was a big big problem. Mr. Zigaoka of the 'Big Commune' wrote a very good close-up was withheld. I wrote a piece of news in the evening newspaper that day. But I think in mind how such news can be abandoned, so I want to do the way, want to publish it in the daily newspaper, so it uses a bit by bit, write one by one. First write the news of Mrs. Sun and Kong coming to Chongqing, and also write about the situation that Mr. Wang Yunwu did not accept his family, and then wrote the message that Chongqing suddenly had a few more foreign dogs eating milk. Divided sent to check, checked together and published, plus Mr. Editor a clever title, so towering the national news actually came out.' The title and subtopic published in the New People's Daily Journal on December 11 is 'Waiting Above Airplane-More Dogs Drink Milk and Seven Eight More', a total of 8 articles, the first three are:\\n△ Yesterday, the Department of Political Affairs held a seminar on 'Pacific War Prospects', just in the war boom, the social service auditorium is limited to wear, and later on without gap. \\n△ There are many people who are standing at the airport from outside the sky. Yesterday Mr. Wang Yunwu also met three times before, three times disappointed. \\n△ Yesterday accompany the foreign dog more than seven eight heads, for real milk drink foreign species. \\nSo painstakingly and vaguely revealed this matter. Under that high pressure, Puxi Xixiu wants to say more, more understand, is not possible. \\nIt was the editorial review of the Great Commune on December 22 that made this matter finally sparked opposition to Kong Xiangxi. In this editorial entitled 'Advocating the Political Amendment Act', for example, said, 'For example, the recent outbreak of the Pacific War, the flight was loaded with caged mother and foreign dog, and many people should be in danger overseas.' This article was published to provoke student strikes and demonstrations at Kunming Southwest United University. In order to quell the tide of learning, the Grand Communiqué published another editorial 'Youth and Politics' on January 22, 1942. According to a corrigendum from the Minister of Transport Zhang Jiahou, said that the aircraft was carrying a foreign dog, 'according to which it was precisely identified as a foreign pilot, has been strictly exemplified', and advised young students not to 'rely on their emotional impulse. Er wasted school, disturbed order, and even unintentionally used by enemy rape'. Before and after two editorial reviews, outright. Tang longitudinal of Chiang Kai-shek's attendant's room read the newspaper this day and said in his diary: 'The Big Communiqué' made a editorial review last year, 'Advocating the Political Amendment Bill', about the fact that an airplane was carried on a strike to students in Kunming, knocking down Kong Xiangxi. Things could not be cleaned up. By the division, Heitu eased the anger of the students. Solve the bell, the 'big commune' is very bitter.' \\nWhat sparked the tide was the editorial of the Grand Communiqué. The 'drip' in the New People's Daily on that day played the role of corroborating and later the big commune. In this report, Pu xixiu showed the cynicism of an honest reporter, showed a capable reporter good at capturing news leads and skillfully revealing information at a time when Wen Ban Sen was strict. The report that she wrote to the late newspaper of the New People's newspaper, which was enough to move the country, had not been published, and was the damage caused to her by the censorship system at that time. \\nPu xixiu is not only a reporter, running the news, she is also the director of the interview. How she was the director, Peng Zigang, who looked at next to him, had a note: 'The role of Pu xixiu in the Xinmin Daily is an interview director. Chongqing was a wartime 'accompany', sparrow was small, all dirty. Under her command, there are a wide variety of journalists, and the background is not simple. Moreover, the layout of the New People's Daily was only half of the major newspapers at that time, and it was impossible for the reporters to be ranked up. Who is missing, will not be satisfied with the director. So, Pu xixiu also had to muster the courage every night to 'fight' for the preparation of manuscripts and even weighing personnel. It is not that she is fighting, changing who is in such a complex environment. If you want to insist on the general direction of unity and resistance and democratic progress, it can't fight without having enough effort to fight. After this wrestling, Xi Xixiu from the location of the New Civil News editorial office of the Qixinggang returned to Youzhuang, more time than midnight. In order to quickly get rid of the struggle of the mood, eating sleeping pills becomes a habit.' \\nThis is the house of Shilang, GakuTin Bay under the Kannon Rock. On June 7, 1942, enemy aircraft bombed Chongqing, the New People's Daily's staff dormitory was blown up, and Pu xixiu borrowed to Shi Liang's family. 'Big Commune' reporter Peng Zigang just borrowed his residence in Shen Junru, Liangzhuang. The two courtyards are very close, running a few steps are also called deserving. Almost every day, they interviewed the news together, together with the night, and spoke very closely. Pu xixiu knows that Peng Zigang is an underground party member of the CPC. \\nAt this time, the Southern Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), with Zhou Enlai as secretary, was stationed in Chongqing. The public institutions were Xinhua Daily and the Military Office of the 18th Group. This was both an important subject of Pu xixiu's frequent interview and a source of important information and insights. She had seen Deng Yingchao in Wuhan in 1938. Zhou Enlai had not seen before, but she had seen it again. Sister Anxiu married Peng Dehuai in Yan'an in 1938. Deng Yingchao warmly called Pu xixiu as 'our relative', called her 'Pu Second Sister'. Pu xixiu felt that the Communist Party did not treat her as an outsider. \\nIn January 1941, the wannan incident occurred, and the political air in Chongqing was also strained. Deng Ying Chao wanted Pu xixiu to leave Chongqing for a while, and sent her a toll. She thought she was easy to get a job, leaving and finding a job would be difficult. At the same time just built up a home, she would not have to leave. She did not accept Deng Yingchao's money, and thought she could use that money to help the more in need. Later, Mei Yi, Xu Maijin and Shi Ximin in the article in memorial to Pu xixiu said: 'When the events in southern Anhui, we have to evacuate some comrades secretly to leave Chongqing. Pu xixiu helps us introduce the cover relationship, and even buy tickets and find transportation.' When she was doing this, Yuan Ziying also used his own conditions to help her best. \\nOn August 10, 1945, Japan proposed to surrender if Emperor Hirohito could be allowed to remain in the throne. The news came to Chongqing, the mountain city was carnival. On August 11, in the Xinmin newspaper, published a close-up of Puxi Xixiu, wrote a carnival atmosphere:\\n'The slogans of Japan's surrender were filled with vehicles of patrol size, and US military jeeps were intercepted by people along the street to celebrate, making it impossible for a moment to pass. Both adults and children are willing to climb jeep, share the glory of victory, celebrate the surrender of the enemy. Allied hats to thank you, immediately put the jeep into a door screen, slowly moving forward. Only the gendarmerie still had to perform their duties, and a group of rave masses were pulled down.' \\n'Several American soldiers were holding bottles of wine, drunk and a crowd of people, and the flag was hanging high on the big truck, whoever squeezed in the car and shouted, because 'We're going home. ' Cars filled with artillery battles sold along the street, ready to put. In the night it becomes a spectacle.' \\nAn Able Journalist (Part 2)-For the New China\\nWith the end of the anti-Japanese war, the political situation has changed dramatically. On August 28, Mao Zedong arrived in Chongqing at the invitation of Chiang Kai-shek. Pu xixiu reported the scene of a warm welcome at the airport:\\n'Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong arrived in Chongqing yesterday at 3:30 p.m. The hearts of the entire Chinese people are cheering, cheering that unity is promising, and the future of peace is guaranteed. \\n'Mr. Mao departed from Yan'an at 12:00 a.m. Yesterday, and the flight distance between YanChongqing was only three hours. When the reporter arrived at Jiulongpo Airport at a moment, General Zhou Zhirou represented Chairman Jiang, Secretary General Shao Lizi, all the staff of the Military Office of the Eighteenth Group, foreign reporters waiting long ago. Then the Democratic League was headed by Zhang Lan. Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Cold Yuqiu, Zhang Bojun, Zuo Shunsheng, Tan Pingshan, and other old Mr. Shu Fadu Bai were also in their own ranks and rushed to their own ranks. The lounge is more sitting Guo Moruo couple etc. Everybody always runs from indoors to outside, waiting with joy and anxious. Even if the autumn tiger is scary again, no one feels tired. \\n'The welcome heard the voice of the horn, the group looked up at the sky, but the northwest corner of a two soaring, no matter the guard guard block, iron bird just landed, people have arrived at the gate. Mr. Zhou Enlai initially approached the welcome, but he still let Mr. Mao Zedong come down first. Blue gray cloth uniform, red face, heavy Hunan accent, peasant nature, health can not be seen is already fifty-two old age. He was wearing a gray squad's helmet. The card was constantly handed into his hands, he shake hands with the greet one by one, and he said thanks. Mr. Zhou was more familiar with the introduction. Ambassador Hurley, General Zhang Zhi, followed closely. Wang Ruofei seems to be fatter. \\n'While China's national character forgot to welcome distant visitors with flowers, real enthusiasm has passed the flowers. Kemerah (quote note: English camera transliteration), blocked the way to the way, and decided to let everyone take a big shot. Hurley continues to say, 'It's alive like Hollywood. ' A dozen minutes later left a way. The two cars that were greeted have already opened to come. First, President Jiang's special mission, the first was the American embassy. But Hurley insisted to sit with his car, so Mao, Mr. Zhou and General He and Zhang Liang were in one car to the Minister's House of Zhang Zhizhong. \\nThe CCP negotiations, as well as the political consultative meetings that result from this negotiation, are places of news. Pu xixiu and Peng Zigang of the Grand Commune, and Shi Ximin of Xinhua Daily, often go for interviews together. It was just this day that my sister Anxiu also came to Chongqing from Yan'an. Sisters reunited, natural excitedly happy. They are not just a pleasure for Sutiren, but the two are very close politically. They were like two soldiers fighting on different battlefields, and they met, and there was really something to say. After the national liberation, they reunited. Anxiu told her sister that this time it was appointed by the Party to Chongqing to pick up her to Yan'an. She blamed her sister, saying, Why didn't you tell me then? My sister said, 'I don't think you will go anyway, so I didn't say it. What do you want me to do in Chongqing at such a great risk?' Pu xixiu thought, also, even if her sister said, she probably did not necessarily go. In Chongqing, she has too much concern. Here, she has her career, but also has her friendship that is not easy to cut off. She mentioned this in her autobiography in her old age, saying: 'I was still in the journalist profession at that time. I felt that I was so familiar with comrades in Xinhua Daily, and I would not want to leave them.' \\nIn what she said, 'Comrades of Xinhua Daily', the first is Shi Ximin, director of the interview department who often runs with her news. Zhu Jiashu said in the mourning 'Pu's Second Sister Diaoyan': 'She also admired the party's talented man Shi Ximin, often interviewed together, there are many common languages.' So we have a more specific understanding of what she says in her autobiography, 'I don't want to leave them.' \\nSoon after, Pu xixiu joined the China Democratic League. On this, she said in her autobiography: 'I joined the NLD because I stayed at the Sister Sta's house and was repeatedly persuaded by her. I think it's a progressive democracy anyway, and joining it doesn't matter. I later told Comrade Shi Ximin of Xinhua Daily about joining the NLD. He said, 'You're still interested in politics. Is it bad for me to introduce you to the party? ' I think I've been with you for a long time. Of course, it's good to join the party. If he introduced me to the party at that time, I must have joined.' \\nPu xixiu participates in the Democratic Alliance, not the Communist Party. It had a little chance in her. In her view, it was also part of a revolutionary organization, but did not think that it had a lot to do with her fate in the second half of her life. But there is no need to repent afterwards. Her subsequent fate, most fundamentally, has a reason for its temperament. \\nIn Pu xixiu's journalist career, there was an interview that deserved a big book, which was the report of the political consultation meeting. The meeting of the CPPCC held in January 1946 was the product of negotiations between the Communist Party and the Communist Party. It was agreed that representatives of various political forces in the country would assemble to discuss the future fate of the nation, how to avoid civil war, build a nation peacefully and implement the constitution. With regard to this major po"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "litical event, Pu xixiu has designed a very innovative and large-scale reporting programme. More than a month before the opening of the meeting, she began to interview 38 CPPCC representatives from various parties one by one, one interview (two written by two people), published daily. In every brief brief visit, she not only objectively reflected the political positions and attitudes of the interviewees, but also implicitly expressed their judgments on each individual in writing down her own impressions. \\nThe first 'Visit to Mr. Fusnien' was published in the evening newspaper New Civil on 28 November 1945. Fu, a non-party person, seems to be less optimistic about the future of the meeting. 'The first thing to clarify politics,' he said. But this has not been done. How can some of the real problems of negotiations be resolved?' \\nIn his visit to NLD Chairman Zhang Lan, Pu xixiu cannot help but praise: 'His firm and frank attitude can indeed be called the leader of the third party.' To another NLD representative, Shen Junru, interviewed: 'He is kind and affectionate, but that strong will often lead him to stand up for the state affairs.' The visit also described his claim on the coalition government: 'The first thing is to end one-party politics, with all parties and no parties working together to organize the regime. Secondly, the participants, not as the nature of the consultation, must have actual executive power.' \\nThis is not the case for the depiction of Al-Shabaab leader Zeng Qi. At the beginning of the visit, 'Mr. Zuo Shunsheng introduced Mr. Zeng Qi to us: 'He may not match the appetite of young people, but his moral essay is worthy of admiration. ' Indeed, when the reporter met the Al-Shabaab leader yesterday, he was full of old style figures. Regarding political opinions, interview reports, Zeng Qi said: 'Before Mao Zedong came to Chongqing, they called for the formation of a coalition government, which is right. But since Mao's came to Chongqing and began negotiations, it was wrong to become a struggle for military politics and local hubs.' At that time, Al-Shabaab was an opposition party, hoping to enter the government to share power, so it was right to say that the Communist Party's coalition government was right. \\nThe ruling Kuomintang cannot accept this claim. Shao Lizi's visit was quoted as saying that 'the coalition government is not working.' In an interview with Pu xixiu, Chen Lifu said, 'As for the coalition government, it is never appropriate to China's national circumstances. The end of training and government is to return the power to the people. It is never to give it to all parties, because the people without parties account for 98 percent.' \\nThe representatives of the Communist Party refuted Zeng Qi from another perspective. In an interview with her, Dong Biwu said that the Communist Party did not abandon the issue of the coalition government and focused on military and local issues. He said: 'The Kuomintang has a party army, why should the Communist Party's army of people's self-defense be deprived of it? Actually, the nationalization of the army is what the Chinese Communist Party has always advocated, but it must be handed over to a democratic government and not to another party.' \\nBefore presenting his political ideas, Zhou Enlai described his grace: 'Mr. Zhou's brown leather coat was the best of all delegations in grey cotton. His uncluttered grace, frank and powerful rhetoric was indeed a leader in the delegation, a leader in the negotiations over the years'. \\nThe interviewee's name is stated in each of this group of visits, with one exception, which says 'a delegate'. He was not willing to be interviewed at all. He was entangled by Pu xixiu. However, he said a little opinion, but he told him not to publish his name. Pu xixiu promised. So, at the beginning of the visit, it was said: 'A representative of the Political Consultative Conference, was discreet, and the journalist visited three times, and the last time it was still waiting for an afternoon to see it. His busy business and his daily work up to 16 hours is more valuable because of the importance of his statement. Here to respect his opinion, it is a secret name.' Someone asked Pu xixiu: Who is this representative? She replied: I promised that he would never announce, and I had to keep it. But when you finish reading this group of reports, don't it naturally know? It is this way that thirty-seven names of the thirty-eight CPPCC representatives appeared in her visit memorial. If they did not appear, only KMT representative Wang Shijie, who was the Foreign Minister, was the representative of the Kuomintang. He expressed his firm anti-Communist attitude expressed in the interview, and Pu xixiu gave him the truth. \\nIn the opposition between the two parties, the Democratic Alliance is on the side of the Communist Party. In an interview, Lolongi, the propaganda chief of the NLD, said: 'Generally speaking, the government must be prepared to open the regime first. If we talk about reunification first, there will be no results, and the issue of nationalization of the army will also have to be handed over from both sides.' Puxiu asked him: 'Some people say that the Democratic League is the tail of the CCP?' Luo answered: 'The CCP talks about democracy, and the political ideas of the Democratic League are the same. Of course, the Kuomintang talks about democracy, and the Democratic Alliance is willing to cooperate with the KMT. The NLD can do any one talk about the tail of a democratic party.' The visit remarked Lorongi's words: 'The corruption and inefficiency of the administration are a manifestation of political undemocracy. Because other parties have not achieved legal status, the DPRK party can act alone, and the opposition party cannot monitor and criticize. If democratic elections were carried out and the DPRK party knew that it had to run on an equal footing with the opposition party after a period of power, then it would not dare let go of doing bad things.' \\nHe expressed the hope that the Democratic League could play a greater role in the domestic political situation. In Zhang Bojun's visit, she made a few words of her own thoughts. She said: 'The reporter deeply felt that the power of a third party without a gun pole would be very useful if the meeting was going smoothly, as the United States's Pioneer Tribune said: 'Without the efforts of these middlemen, Marshal Marshal's work in China will be desperate. '' \\nMarshall was the United States envoy for the reconciliation between the Communist Party. At one time, he said the expectation that Lorongi said: 'China's liberals should be united within a single liberal patriotic party, dedicated to the welfare of the people, not the self-interest of the small party leaders. In this way, they can influence the political situation, which will grow as the party gains positions and is sponsored. Such a party can stand between the two major political parties, and without the support of this liberal party, under normal circumstances, it will not be possible to take decisive steps.' (Marshall Make Hua, 1981 Chinese Book Board Edition, p. 436), Zhang Bojun, Lorongki, and Puxiu, who is already members of the NLD at this time, are all liberals whom Marshall holds high hopes. \\nThe Political Consultative Conference was opened on 10 January 1946. The opening report written by Pu xixiu was published in the evening newspaper of the New People's Daily. In the ensuing session of the General Assembly, she reported in detail every day on the ideas of the parties and parties. \\nIn an interview with the CPPCC meeting, Rolongi made a good impression on her. Zhang Linlan, a colleague of the New People, later wrote down in an article in memory of Pu xixiu: 'One day I was playing in Yushuang, she told me that I met a person recently. 'This man is amazing, good eloquent, good foreign language, good pen, a thousand words, waving; listened to him a few times, and felt he was keen to observe, and his opinion was high, I really dump it! ... Oh, you wouldn't think funny, right?' To her girlfriend, she spoke frankly about Lo's 'dump' mood. \\nThe political consultation meeting was closed on 31 January. On February 10, more than 10,000 people from all walks of life in Chongqing gathered at Jiaochangkou Square to celebrate the success of the political consultation meeting. When the meeting was about to be held, there was a riot at the venue. That was when the Bureau was in the process of negotiating the nomination of the President, and suddenly a person opened the meeting and took office as President. Li Gongpu was about to go up and ask him what happened, that is, he was beaten by a mob. Then, more than 60 people were injured, including Shi Fuliang, Ma Yinchu, Guo Moruo and journalists. It was a premeditated operation. Not only did this group of murderers bear iron gravel, but also prepared their General Assembly Declaration and slogan in advance, under the command of groups, and the gendarmerie police present did not stop it. At the head is the agent Liu Yechiao. However, with regard to this incident, the Central Committee made a distorted report. Liu Yechiao ran up to the podium to seek provocation. However, the Central News Agency said it was 'temporarily electing Liu Yechiao, representative of the municipal peasant association,' and the mob committed the mob, but the Central News Agency said 'the people beat each other', exonerating the perpetrators. Pu xixiu is very angry about this, that is, and several people such as Shi Ximin launched an open letter to the Central News Agency. In this open letter, which she participated in the drafting, citing the facts, pointed out that the Central News Agency's report was 'quite false'. The letter said: 'Your agency is a national press release organ, influence, forgive it to the truth, this news chronicle should seek true principles. People and other people care for your society, dare to be foolish, and try a few words, blessed.' Reporters from various Chongqing newspapers signed a total of 42 people in the open letter, including Shi Ximin, Pu xixiu, Gao Ji, Cheng Guangrui, Zeng Minzhi, Deng Shusheng, Qin Benli and Liu Huozi. \\nSoon after the CPPCC meeting, the political focus returned from Chongqing to Nanjing. Pu xixiu also returned to Nanjing Xinmin Newspaper to serve as interview director. When she left Nanjing eight years ago, she was a newcomer in the press. Back now, she is a reputable journalist among peers and readers, and a journalist with a strong political orientation. \\nThe few days she just returned to Nanjing, Dajiaochang Airport became a hot spot for press interviews. A group of military and political dignitaries flew from Chongqing and became the target of reporters chasing. One day, Puxi Xixiu and their newspaper colleague Qian Simbo were busy at the airport for half a day, looking at the night, and they were planning to return to the newspaper and saw an American military plane hovering and descending. The hatch was opened. After several American soldiers went down the ramp, three people wearing suits, Puxi Xixiu's eyes, is not this Shishimin? The three of them are the advance personnel of the Chinese Communist Party delegation in Nanjing. Shi Ximin has always met, and one is Zhou Enlai's deputy security officer Long Feihu. Because they had not been contacted well beforehand, they got off the plane and were not seeing someone to receive them, and they were feeling hard. Pu xixiu invited them to take the car of the New People's newspaper into the city. In the car, Shi Ximin and other people discussed where to go and where to go, Puxi heard and said he could come to her house to rest first. Shi Ximin also said good first, and thought it was wrong, and people would say that the CPC representative went to Nanjing first went to Pu xixiu's family, which would cause her trouble. So according to Qian Xinbo's approach, first go to Shu Zhong Hotel near Xinjiekou, and call Shao Lizi while eating and informing him that the advance staff of the CPC delegation has arrived in Nanjing. Please arrange accommodation. It is considered that this problem was solved. Later, Qian Simbo wrote about this past in a memorial article of Pu xixiu, saying, 'It was a dangerous thing to think of who approached the Communist Party in that year. Pu xixiu took the risk of taking the advance personnel of the CPC delegation into Nanjing. \\nThe arrival of Shi Ximin is another very valuable news material. On May 2, a feature of Pu xixiu's 'House of Representatives of the Chinese Communist Party, Meiyuan Village on Guofu Road' was published in the evening magazine of the New People's Daily, and reported that the Nanjing local authorities found the right place for the Chinese Communist Party delegation. \\nIt was then the eve of a large civil war on a national scale. On the one hand, in the vicinity of Zhangjiakou, in the southeast of Jindong, especially in the northeast, the United States envoy, Marshall, is conducting a reconciliation between the two parties, and the representatives of the Communist Party are still negotiating. Political forces outside the Communist Party, the so-called third party, mainly the Democratic Alliance, together with Al-Shabaab and the social wisdom, also played their respective roles in contributing to the success of the negotiations. Pu xixiu wrote a lot of news around these events. She reported that 'Shao Lizi invited representatives of the NLD Zhang Junmai, Zhang Bojun, Liang Shuming and Huang Yanpei to Beijing today. The Department invited representatives of all parties to meet first and assist in opening the situation as a middleman.' 'Zhang Junmai visited Marshall Special Envoy yesterday afternoon. Ma Shuai is looking forward to China's peace. Lorongi will also meet with Ma Shuai in the day. Zhou Enlai once again met with NLD representatives last night. The Chinese Communist Party (CPC), hoped for the realization of the local coalition government in Northeast China, and also discussed the issue of army restructuring.' He reported the activities of NLD representatives Zhang Junmai, Liang Shuming, Zhang Bojun, Shen Junru, Luo Longji and Shi Liang. She also exclusively reported the news of the interview with Marshall, said that 'Ma Shuai and the NLD take the median view, the government's attitude is not completely hard and without room for consultation', and the news hinted that a truce order can be issued in the near future. \\nOn June 6, Chiang Kai-shek accepted Marshall's proposal and ordered a 15-day truce in the Northeast. During the armistice on July 7-21, the two parties of the CPC held peace talks in Nanjing, and the third aspect also actively promoted from the side. Pu xixiu introduced the NLD's position in the report. She also reported a sentence that Rolongki said to her: 'The Communist Party of China fought, and the middlemen persuaded, not allowed to fight, is called neutral. But there is no neutrality for democracy and freedom, because they are also oppressed.' This is a good illustration of the neutrality of the NLD at that time. As far as political positions are concerned, the NLD stands on the side of the Communist Party for democracy and freedom. \\nBy June 21, no results were presented. Chiang Kai-shek and Zhou Enlai announced the extension of the Northeast Armistice for another eight days, until 30. After eight years of bitter war, the Chinese people hope that the peace talks will succeed and that the civil war that has begun can be stopped. It was a matter of urgency to see that no agreement was reached in this armistice negotiations. In order to express the people's strong desire to oppose the civil war for peace and promote the success of the negotiations, on 23 June, the Shanghai People's Peace Petitions Mission went to Nanjing to appeal for peace to the parties concerned. The delegation was headed by Masulun as the head of the delegation. Among the members of the delegation were Fanfang, Sheng Pihua, Bao Dashan, Zhang Qiao Bo, Yan Baohang, Lei Jie-Qiong, and the secretaries of the delegation were beard baby. In addition, two students represented Chen Zhenzhong and Chen Lifu. More than 50,000 people from all walks of life who sent them away were held at the station. Tao Xingzhi, Wu Han, Lin Handa and others made speeches, demonstrating their firm determination to oppose the civil war. After the departure, tens of thousands of people held demonstrations. \\nWhen the delegation arrived at the Nanjing Shimonoseki station, the delegation was besieged and assaulted by a preempted KMT agent mob, causing the 'Shimonoseki tragedy'. Masulun, Yan Baohang and others were wounded. Pu xixiu, who went to the interview, and Gaoji, reporter Gao Ji, who visited the NLD headquarters to welcome the delegation, were also wounded. At the same time, Lei Jie-Qiong, Ye Duyi and St. John's University students Chen Zhenzhong were the most seriously injured. \\nThis is very brief in Pu xixiu's autobiography: 'On June 23, the Shanghai Peace Petitions Delegation Masulun waited to Nanjing to petition against the civil war. I was welcomed by telephone from Fan Yangtze River from the delegation of the Communist Party of China and Gaoji, reporter Gaoji, etc. to Shimonoseki Station. It was beaten with the delegation by KMT agents that night, known as the 'Shimonoseki Incident'. The beating this time increased my political awareness. I realized the truth that the Communist Party could not lay down its arms, I realized the significance of the armed revolution, and I hate the reactionary authorities of the KMT even more. I was greatly encouraged by the care of the party and the masses of condolences. After a month of injury, I did my journalist job, I did more vigorous.' \\nAt the time of the situation on the scene, Lei Jie-Qiong recalled: 'Our delegation was just out of the ticket counter. Suddenly there was a whistle, a group of mob who called themselves' refugees' flourished, scolded, a chaotic, surrounded us. The military and police present are turned a blind eye. In the chaos, the people of our delegation were pushed and pulled, separated into two parts, Masulun and I had several reporters pushed into the waiting room, and four representatives including Yan Baohang were pushed into the Western restaurant, where the 'refugees' gathered outside the door yelling and noisy. At that time, Pu xixiu, Gaoji and other newspaper reporters explained to the 'refugees' their identity requests to go out. They just went out soon and were surrounded by thugs outside the door. Someone in the crowd shouted 'Hit that woman! ' Pu xixiu was beaten immediately. And someone shouted, 'That man is not a good thing! ' So Gao set was beaten. As a last resort, journalists had to return to the waiting room. At a time when more and more 'refugees' surrounded outside, they flocked in and shouted. Usually, tables and chairs, soda bottles and teacups flying to our head, Masulun was hit very seriously injured, Puxi Xixiu and Gaoji were not spared. I was pulled my hair by a mob, my chest was hit by a sputum, and a mob was trying to grab my ring and handbag. I resisted desperately, my hands were caught and bleed. In the chaos, Pu xixiu was pushed down again on my body, and the mob took off their shoes and pumped us both. Her nose was bleeding on my face. In order to protect me, she was lying on my body, hit harder and almost fainted. I heard a cry in the midst of a dull: 'Don't kill them, it's almost okay... 'The fierce stopped.' \\nThe atrocities continued from 7 p.m. to 12:00 p.m. Pu xixiu's injury, according to a report by the Xinmin newspaper, the reporter saw when she was in the hospital bandage injury: 'Puxi Xiu's hair was pulled by a lot of hands. The left side of the head, arm, legs and back were assaulted four times by the beaten hands, the injuries were not light, the clothes were torn, the purse was robbed, the watch and pen were also two branches. Robbery.' \\nPu xixiu's self-legend is that she was 'a month of injury', in fact she started working for half a month after she was beaten and injured. On July 9, she published the news she wrote about Marshall's feast as Feng Yuxiang, who is about to visit the United States for water conservancy. One such thing was mentioned in the news: 'When representatives of the Shandong National Congress visited him recently, the representatives complained about how the Communist Party of Shandong burned the traitor, like to enumerate. Ma Shuai said, 'You said only 60 percent, that 40 percent, I know better than you, but I ask you, are you coming to represent the Government or the people? ' The delegates said, 'We represent the people of course. ' 'You both represent the people, then why don't you report against the corrupt officials of the government? The United States is not so wealthy, and we are also coming from the relief supplies of the United Nations Relief and Relief Agency. But after being shipped to China, government officials took them and sold them, and they didn't give them all directly to the ordinary people. Why don't you report it, if you just complained of the Communist Party's sins, I am not the Communist Party! Ma Shuai was passionate and generous, the delegates were silent.' When Pu Heisu wrote this paragraph, it is assumed that the image of the group of 'Northwest refugees' that was encountered in Shimonoseki half a month ago. \\nMarshall's disposition has not been able to bring the civil war to a halt. Large-scale fighting took place in Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong. On October 11, the Kuomintang army entered Zhangjiakou, a large city in the liberated area. Chiang Kai-shek thinks this is his major military victory, namely, the decision to unilaterally convene the National Convention in spite of the opposition of the Communist Party and the NLD, in fact declaring the breakdown of the peace talks. Zhou Enlai also returned to Yan'an. \\nOn the eve of Zhou Enlai's departure from Nanjing, Pu xixiu went farewell before. Later in her autobiography, she recalled: 'I relentlessly left him at Meiyuan Xincun until late in the night before returning home. I think they go this, I will not rely on, will get lost. Comrade Zhou Enlai cares for me and wants me to go out less. His farewell message was: 'Read more! ' The people who said goodbye to him that night were so many, and he didn't have a lot of effort to elucidate me. Comrade Fan Changjiang said, 'We will be back soon. ' \\nEntering 1947, the civil war is getting worse. At the end of February, the KMT side forced the Chinese Communist Party delegation to evacuate. As Zhou Enlai said in a letter to Chiang Kai-shek, this indicates that Jiang has 'determined that the civil war is in the end, and will close the door to all negotiations with the ultimate breakdown.' In the early morning of March 7, all the members of the CPC delegation in Nanjing, Shanghai and Chongqing withdrew in Yan'an by United States military aircraft. On the eve of the withdrawal, the Chinese Communist Party delegation in Meiyuan Xincun has been closely monitored by KMT agents, and the members of the delegation lost their freedom of movement. At this time, it was necessary to retrieve a package of important documents placed in the Xinhua Daily office, and delegation spokesman Mei Yi entrusted this matter to Pu xixiu. Pu xixiu did this in the thrill. After this, Qian Xinbo recalled: 'The preparation of the Xinhua Daily is next door to the US Information Office on North Zhongshan Road. The back doors of these two families are not far apart, both in a lane. At that time I often went to the US Information Service and was quite familiar with the environment, Pu xixiu pulled me and her to complete the task. We went in from the front door of the US News Office, and came out, knocked on the back door of the Xinhua Daily. A few words, it immediately delivered a package wrapped in cloth. Pu's sister took the package was about to leave, and the agents who were monitoring around the scene discovered that whistle-tone was a masterpiece. We rushed into the US News Office, out of the front door, and took a car that went to the newspaper. The car drove to Xinjiekou and found that we were stung by a jeep. Pu xixiu and I changed their mind and asked the driver to drive the car to the US embassy, and wanted to talk to the US Ambassador to China Sturelden on the opportunity to get rid of the agent stalking. Who knows that the jeep stopped in front of the US embassy just won't go until we leave there, and this' tail 'keeps up with us again. Once we don't have a chance, we need the driver to drive the car to the office of Secretary General Shao Lizi in the National Assembly Hall, thinking that the agent will not be behind. Which thought of Jeep is not mistaken. Puxi Xixiu saw this situation, and said to me that in order to deliver things safely, let's go to Meiyuan New Village to give things to Meiyi. As a result, until we drove into the new village of Plum Garden, the agent's jeep turned around and left. In this experience, I was very impressed by the calm and calm Puxi Xixiu.' \\nLater, Mei Yi, who asked her to do this, said in 'Brave and wit Puxi Xixiu,' she 'dumped the tracked agent, bravely and wisely completed my heavy trust. The above examples are no longer a general relationship between journalists and speakers. At noon on the 8th, everyone was deeply moved when I talked about these things with my comrades like Chengzhi and Yangtze River in Yan'an Qingliangshan Xinhua Cafeteria.' \\nOn the evening of March 6, Puxi Xixiu went to Meiyuan Village to say goodbye to them. In her autobiography, she said: 'When Dong Lao is retreating, I am really sad. I think the party will leave me completely. I applied to Comrade Mei Yi to join the party, and I want to maintain a first-line contact with the party.' The narrative for many years after the incident was briefly written. At that time, what was said to colleague Shao Qiong should be more detailed. 'On the eve of the withdrawal of the delegation of the Communist Party of China to Nanjing peace talks,' Shao Qiong said in a memorial article, Puxi Xixiu almost stayed all night in Meiyuan New Village, entangled Dong Lao and Mei Yi, and asked them to bring her to Yan'an. Later she told me about it, emotions were still difficult to control themselves. She said that it was a night that decided her fate throughout her life, 'I wept my eyes, or could not convince them. That time it became, how good to go! ' ... she said that Dong Lao enlightened her that night, saying that she remained in Nanjing more than going to Yan'an. Mei Yi also said that her post was in the New People. Mei Yi analysis, now on the battlefield of civil war, Jiang Jun will be eaten more than ten brigades in a month. In less than two years, the enemy's military power will be turned over. He even accurately predicted that before and after the Mid-Autumn Festival next year, the PLA could win Tianjin and basically solve the problems of Northeast and North China. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek's 'good days' came to an end. Pu xixiu said that he 'said to go a word and want me to liberate in Nanjing. '' Not only does the Kuomintang fail continuously in the military, but also in the rear it is rising prices, social unrest, and popular grievances boiling. There have been incidents of rice robbery in Nanjing and Shanghai. Students from Beiping and Shanghai also shouted slogans against civil war, hunger and persecution during the commemoration of the May Fourth Fourth. In order to suppress the grievances, the KMT government promulgated the Interim Measures on the Maintenance of Social Order on May 18, prohibiting petitions of more than ten persons and all strikes, strikes, demonstrations and giving local authorities the right to deal with them urgently. However, students flouted such a ban. On May 20, more than 7,000 students from college and above schools in Nanjing went to the streets. The authorities used military police, horses and water dragons to block them, resulting in a bloody tragedy, and more than 30 people injured by students, and more than 40 people arrested and disappeared. In response to the incident, CSD's general text said that police and students 'beat each other'. Pu xixiu said, 'No matter what, the Xinmin Daily should always speak fair words.' \\nShao Qiong, a reporter who wrote this news, recalled the situation in that year: 'How should the manuscript be written. I and Zhao Naixin (by now name: Li Tianmin), divided their duties, and then they automatically set up the pen. Pu xixiu sit in the editorial department, we write a, Pu interrogated one, send a, editorial department--typographic room-proofreading group, sample back to the editorial department, a ring buckle, this old machine 'New Civil News' has never been so coordinated.' \\nThis is the article published in the Nanjing New People Daily Journal the next day, 'Yesterday, the sadness of the winds and rainy days, students marched together and bloodshed occurred'. \\nOn this matter, Pu xixiu has a brief description in his autobiography: 'The big event in Nanjing in 1947 was the '5.20' anti-hunger and anti-civil war march. The Xinmin newspaper's interview department reported the most detailed. The next day universities printed thousands of newspapers. I insisted in the newspaper until late at night, not allowing editorial offices to change or delete, and resisted censorship by the censorship.' \\nChen Mingde and Deng Jixing said this matter in the article 'New People's Daily' Twenty Years: 'The support of the New Civil Newspaper for the student movement has been valued by students. The May 21 Journal was updated by university students for 30,000 copies and distributed copies, which in turn greatly inspired the New People's Daily. However, on the other hand, the capital garrison headquarters sent daily special service officers to the editorial department of the Nanjing News Agency. The editorial department had no way, but had to send a reporter who was able to speak out. The secret service officers criticized the student news contained in the 21st Journal for several days, and they could not fail to admit that the language contained was true. It was only at the beginning of the military science conflict, and it was almost two paved ground. Thus, one, Puxiu said, 'Universities have printed thousands of newspapers,' and said less. Second, this report has also undergone such a special review, proving its authenticity. Later, the first series of '5·20 Campaign Materials' from the People's Publishing House of the History of China's Modern Revolution included this report, even more reveal"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "ing its recognized historical value. \\nIn response to the 5·20 incident, Mao Zedong said in the commentary on 'Chiang Kai-shek's government is under siege by the people': 'The sharp struggle between the great just student movement and the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek' is the second front in China, and said: 'The rise in student movement is inevitable. Free to promote the upsurge of the entire people's movement. The historical experience of the past May Fourth Sport period and 12 · 9 sports period has shown this.' \\nPu xixiu also made his own judgment in the commentary 'Peace Movement in the Wave of the Ocean' written for the Weekly Observations: 'The student movement is expanding and developing. '5 · 20' that day, student representatives shouted: 'This is the beginning, our blood is not in vain. ' The '12·9' movement is the prelude to the war of resistance, then the '5 · 20' tragedy or a prelude to stopping civil war and restoring peace.' \\nAt this time, the New Civil newspaper was under considerable pressure. On May 25, the Shanghai authorities ordered the Shanghai edition of Xinmin Daily and Wen Wei Po and the United Evening Newspaper to suspend their publication on charges of 'disrupting social order with the intention of subverting the government.' Chen Bulei also allowed people to bring a letter to Chen Mingde, asking the Xinmin Daily to resign Zhao Chaogou of Shanghai News and Puxu Xixiu of Nanjing News Agency, and was rejected by Chen Mingde. \\nIn his autobiography, Pu xixiu said: 'There are few things to do in Nanjing after the '5·20' student movement. Because it was already difficult to expose anything at the time in the Nanjing Xinmin News. So I kept writing 'Nanjing Newsletter' to Shanghai 'Watch', 'Outlook' and other weekly magazines for publication. In September 1946, 'Watch' weekly magazine, Chu Anping, the author of well-known liberal intellectuals, was an influential political current affairs publication during the liberation war. As researcher Xie Yong points out, 'The birth of Watch reflects, in a sense, the strong desire of liberal intellectuals to participate in the political life of the country through journals', 'reflecting intellectuals's concern for society outside their careers.' It is no accident that Pu xixiu wrote for it. In the Observation, she published a number of political communications such as 'Aerial View of the Third Plenum of the KMT Central Committee' and 'Perspectives Before and After the Opening of the New Government in Thousands of Times'. These can be said to be a long talk than the short manuscripts in the four-opening newspaper Xinmin. These communications are enriched with a large amount of information, and the tendency is more pronounced and coincides with the attitude of the entire publication. \\nThat's when she thought that 'it was already difficult to expose something in the Nanjing New People's Daily', an interview was worth mentioning. On this matter, Qian Xinbo recalled: 'One day, Pu xixiu and I took a car through the Sun Ke Residence on Shanghai Road. She suggested going to visit Sun Ke to see what he had about the current situation. At that time, Sun Ke was vice-chairman of the KMT government. His remarks tended to change at any time. It was elusive for a while pro-Soviet and anti-Soviet. We get off in front of Sun Ke Mansion, progressive business cards, there is no certainty about whether we can see Sun Ke. I didn't expect him to come and see you right away. Originally, Sun Ke is planning to comment, and is prepared. After his meeting, he talked about more than an hour. Sun Ke is the chief representative of the Kuomintang negotiating party of the Communist Party. The talks begin with the resumption of peace talks. On our question, Sun Koma made clear that there is no peace talks at present. It is already when you die and I live, either the Kuomintang defeated the Communist Party or the Communist Party overthrowing the KMT government...' This visit was published in the evening magazine of The New Civil Newspaper on June 22, and all major news agencies have been forwarded, causing them to be forwarded by major news agencies. Note by all parties. \\nIn early 1949, Mao Zedong referred Sun Ke as one of the 'several persons' of superstitious force within the Kuomintang in his comment on 'Several answers to the Kuomintang's responsibility for war' for Xinhua News Agency. Here by the way: the note in the 'Mao Selection' regarding the source of this material is not accurate. The original note said: 'This is what Sun Ke said in a speech issued on June 22, 1947 in Nanjing when he received reporters from the Associated Press, the Kuomintang 'Central Daily' and 'Xinmin Daily'. In fact, the 'Central Daily' was simply reproduced. The Associated Press simply sent a telecommunications basis. This time Sun Ke's conversation did not receive their reporters. It is a pity that the book 'Pu xixiu's career tracing' did not include this article. \\nIn 1947, a big thing happened in Puxi Xixiu's personal life, which was that her feelings and Lorongi took a step further, as well as his divorce from Yuan Ziying. In her autobiography, she recalled: 'After the Chinese Communist Party delegation retreated in March 1947, I felt so lonely, there were no more interlocutors, and I was very bitter in my heart. I became acquainted with Loronki and I thought it was good to have a friend. He taught me to write articles. He said, old journalist okay? Always one step up to be able to become a columnist. This is just my mind. We often meet as a result of the further development of feelings. He was intentionally seeking a courtship because he and his wife had long been separated. And what about me? My husband and I had a disagreement as early as they were in Chongqing. Yuan Ziying arrived in Shanghai after his surrender in Japan. When I worked in Nanjing, he rarely came back. My affection with Loronki grew up and led to my divorce. After my formal divorce in the winter of 1947, I spent a month in Beiping's sister's home, and later returned to Nanjing Xinmin Daily to continue working. At that time, because the NLD was dissolved, he had already travelled to Shanghai to get sick at the Hongqiao Sanatorium. 'We were going to marry, but we didn't get married because the environment was not allowed, and he had a serious lung disease.' \\nThe divorce between Pu xixiu and Yuan Ziying is not a surprise among their acquaintances. Some colleagues said that while in Chongqing, he went to her house for meals several times, and did not see her Mr. once. Her children also told people that at that time there were many guests in the family, and their parents had a circle of friends, and could not sit alone, nor could they speak of one piece. The two people have different minds, and the emotional basis of this marriage is not strong. In an interview with CPPCC representatives in Chongqing, Luolongji became her favorite idol. Now when there is contact, things evolve according to its own logic. \\nKim Rowan was a staff member of the NLD headquarters for that time and lived in the backyard of Lorongi for some time. He recalls, 'Puxi Xixiu and her husband Yuan Ziying have been getting divorced over the years due to different interests and feelings. On the other hand, from Chongqing to Nanjing, Puxiu met Lorongki in a long period of news interviews. At that time, Luo was the propaganda minister at the headquarters of the NLD, an external spokesperson and a regular contact with journalists. During the meeting of the old CPPCC, he worked very well with Wang Bingnan, representative of the Communist Party of China, and became a prominent journalist at the time in his fight against KMT representatives. In his long-term engagement with him, Pu xixiu admired his keen thinking and talents, as well as his political inclination and grace. Lorongi married Wang's family in early years, but as early as in Kunming, the two people were not divorced. Loronki lived alone for a long time. Although we all know that he has several girlfriends and 'dry daughters' often come to him, he still has ten minutes of love for Pu xixiu, and for a long time he forged close friendship with each other. Thanks to Luolongki's intervention, she increased her contradiction to Yuan Ziying... With the support and help of Xinmin Daily boss Deng Jixing, she came forward to persuade Yuan Ziying, agreeing to hold a tea party attended by friends from both sides on December 1. Pu xixiu and Yuan Ziying formally signed the divorce procedure. Publish divorce notice. Pu xixiu took a flight to Beiping the next day after his divorce and lived with her eldest sister, Pu Jiexu, for a period of time to compensate for the many traumatic pain she had experienced over the years. In her letter to Luo when she left Nanjing, she said, 'I feel really relaxed now. ' \\nIV. Prison\\nAfter the breakdown of the peace talks, the KMT intensified its persecution against the NLD. On October 7, 1947, Du Bincheng, member of the NLD Northwest Branch, was publicly shot dead. On 20 October, the military police surrounded the headquarters of the NLD in Nanjing. At this time, NLD leaders lived in Shanghai, and only Lorongi was sitting in Nanjing. His movements were closely monitored, and every outgoing trip was followed by military and police agents. On 27, the KMT government declared NLD an illegal group. On 6 November, NLD was forced to declare disbanded. At this time, Luolongji also went to Shanghai to visit Guangci Hospital, and he had a constant exchange of letters with Puxi Xixiu who stayed in Nanjing. \\nOn July 8, 1948, the Kuomintang authorities announced 'permanent suspension of sanctions' on a series of charges of 'propaganda, defamation of the government, spreading rumors, inciting people, shaking morale...'. \\nNewspaper was sealed, Puxi Xiuyuan can leave Nanjing. At this time, Xu Zhucheng wants to create Hong Kong's 'Wen Wei Bao', and Tochin Ben signed Pu Hee to write the 'Nanjing Newsletter', agreeing to write four articles a month, HK$100. She was still interested in writing communications, and life could be maintained, so she stayed. \\nXu Zhucheng about her writing 'Nanjing Newsletter' is looking for the right person. Her writing and knowledge have long been respected. Although she is not allowed to act as a reporter, she has extensive social ties, such as Fu Jingbo, the Chinese Secretary of the US Ambassador to China Stuoleiden, Legislative Councillor Yu Zhenying, Chen Jianchen, and some friends in the press, are willing to share with her Talk, provide some information. Every week, she first looked at the news in the newspaper and found out an anti-Jiang theme from it, together with the information collected, summarized and analyzed, written into a newsletter sent to Chin Benli in Shanghai and forwarded to Hong Kong. \\nOn September 9, 1948, the publication of Wen Wei Po in Hong Kong began. On the 9th and 10th for two consecutive days, Pu Xi Xixixiu published the Nanjing newsletter 'Is it an ace?' Subtopic is 'Reforming the Money System Insider'. Then, a series of articles were published in a series of articles such as 'Nanjing before the failure of Jinan', 'Nanjing after Jinan easy hands', 'struggling with currency change', 'Nanjing today', 'the end of the gold yuan coupon'. Because at this time she can no longer publish articles under this name. These articles were published with the signature of 'Nanjing Special Commissioner Qinghan (or Youth Letter)'. This set of articles is quite fully written about the situation of Chiang Kai-shek's rule near the extinction, and is of great historical value. The article revolved around two top priorities at the time, namely war and monetary reform. The article provides a deep analysis of both things and the connection between them. \\n'Is it an ace?' What is talking about the insider of monetary reform is the material provided by Huang Miaosi, who is the deputy head of the Central Bank Secretariat. His wife Yufeng made a supplement in the Xinmin newspaper, and Puxi Xixiu went to him for help because of his relationship with Yufeng. Although Huang Miaozi is an artist for a long time in the KMT side, his heart is on the side of the Communist Party and has always used his special identity to help the Communist Party. Just look at this article written by Pu xixiu with his help on the reform of the coin system, which includes not only 'insider' that outsiders cannot learn, but also insightful analysis that only financial and financial experts can make. \\nOn August 19, Chiang Kai-shek ordered a reform of the currency system and the issuance of gold vouchers. Pu xixiu said at the beginning of this article sent on September 3: 'The reform of the coin system this card was stowed. It is an ace or a rotten card, it is still a big question.' Finance Minister Wang Yunwu strongly advocates the issuance of the new currency. His wishful calculations are based on increasing taxes, second, hoping to reduce military spending, and thirdly counting on US aid. In response to these three items, Pu xixiu's article analysis said: a tax increase, compared with the original budget, goods tax, direct tax increased tenfold, salt tax nearly sixty times. The IRS director believes that it is 'absolutely impossible to do'. The article said: 'When this people are exhausted, such heavy taxes really don't know where to converge.' Military spending, the article said: 'The war continues, military spending will continue to inflate... the most important part of the reform case is to improve the treatment of soldiers. Wouldn't it be a miracle that the soldiers pay millions a month, now to more than 20 million a month, and Minister Wang wants to reduce military spending?' As for the expectation that US aid will be used to make up for the budget, the article cited the attitude expressed by the US side, stating that 'roughly the pie should be made.' After analyzing various factors, the article states: 'In short, civil war cannot stop, production cannot be increased, budgets are not balanced, prices are not stable. This situation dragged down, can today's gold yuan coupon guarantee that it will not become the currency of the year?' \\nThis article also analyzes Chiang Kai-shek's forced gold and silver voucher to accept foreign currency of private gold and silver, said: 'This reform of the monetary system, in the view of the economic experts, in the opinion of the ordinary people, can't see what it is. But there are also people who think that this is the clever intentions of those in office. This is a strategy for those in power to enter and retreat. Of course, the situation today depends on the battlefield. With 2 billion yuan 3 million yuan a big bill, you can always fight a few hard battles in the future. Fight and win, all problems solved. 'The battle is invincible, and the gold money in white paper is also well prepared in case.' \\nThe article concludes with a phrase: 'At present, the government is really trying to maintain the value of this card. The government itself is also trembling, as if the 'small 2' in the poker field as the' old K' hit the spirit. Ji is a fierce, win or lose, they also pinched a sweat. This trump card in the end is a rotten card, I'm afraid time will prove soon.' \\nSure, it was soon proved that it was a rotten card. Pu xixiu in the 'struggles of currency change' describes the collapse of the Golden Yuan Voucher: 'The most rare thing in Nanjing snapping is that rice shop has no rice. Someone walked all over the city and could not buy a grain of rice.' 'Confectionery, cakes and bread are all swept. Housewives have been restless in the room for a few days. The streets do not work, shopping malls are not crowded. Today, the capital is an unprecedented outfit.' \\nThe article concludes: 'When the monetary reform case is announced, everyone knows that the bill can only have short-term effect at best. The short time was when many debated, some estimated five months and three months. Today, less than two months from 8 to 19, the reform case is already in the final struggle. This case is of great relevance. Jin Yuan coupon collapsed, I'm afraid the whole situation will follow the collapse. So today the government also made the final struggle under the currency system.' \\nA few days later published the 'End of the Golden Yuan Voucher', the subtopic is 'collapse with the military defeat.' At the beginning, 'Golden Yuan coupon on the day of its birth, it was doomed to the fate of failure. But no one expected it to fail so fast, so miserable, even more ugly! The government was supposed to play an empty set of tricks. The reform of the monetary system, which violates economic law, is entirely dependent on the support of political forces, but political authority depends solely on military progress. At present, both as the autumn wind sweeping leaves fall, the gold round voucher of course will follow the fall.' The article pointed out sharply: 'At this point, anyone knows that this is close to the edge of big change.' If you want to be more explicit, it is that Chiang Kai-shek's rule will come to its end. \\nAnother hot spot of public concern was the battle that was defeated at that time. Pu xixiu's 'Nanjing Communications' made some analysis of the reasons for defeating the war. She pointed out that one of the reasons was Chiang Kai-shek interfered with the command of the battlefield generals: 'After the fall of Kaifeng, the legislature asked him for military responsibility. He Yingchin was quite frankly said that the Ministry of Defence did not have the power to command the army, and all military victory or defeat lies with the president. It is said that the battle of Xiangyang, Kang Ze was captured, and the result was also disliked by the commander-in-chief of White (Chongxi), and the president The President ordered Kang Ze to die and wait for assistance, commander-in-chief ordered Kangze camera to retreat. Of course, Kangze accepted the President's order, so the chief of appeasement became a prisoner of the Communist Army. 'Minister He Yingqin called the Chief of Staff to report on the Jinan war situation. The Chief of Staff also said: 'The local guards report directly to the president, and the president directly directs death waiting for assistance by telegram, which has nothing to do with the Chief of Staff. ' \\nWu Huawen battlefield uprising, originally from the Northwest Army, accelerated the liberation of Jinan. One of the reasons for Pu xixiu's analysis of Wu Xinhuai Erzhi is 'that the Central Committee intends to eliminate dissent,' in order to see the contradictions of the Jiang Jun faction and Chiang Kai-shek's selfishness, and the centrifugation of the army is also a major factor in defeat. \\nOn 7 November, the People's Liberation Army launched the Battle of Huaihai. On the 8th, the deputy commander of the third Pacification District Zhang Kexia and He Jifeng led the revolt in Jiawang, with a big gap on the front. On the 10th, Xuzhou's largest main force Huang Baitao Corps was in the vicinity of the mill in the area of re-encircled. The whole battle was lost at the beginning. Pu xixiu sat at home and heard that every day there were planes taking off from Nanjing. She knows that this reflects the tension of the war, and the Nanjing government has approached its end. She wants to write the last 'Nanjing Newsletter' for Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po: 'The Last Struggle of the Nanjing Government'. The article begins with this paragraph: 'In this time of military downturn, economic collapse, foreign aid desperation, no one believes that there will be any miracle in Nanjing. Today Nanjing is in a state of chaos, panic, and terror, but the government is still struggling with the final struggle. It may be the darkness before dawn in the ordinary people!' The article lists the headaches of skyrocketing prices, teacher strikes, Dewey's election, and the desperation of US aid. As for military aspects, the article points out: 'Northeast is finished, and North China is also few left. Now it is going to be a battle against China and China.' 'This war is said to be the last battle; if Xuzhou easy hands, Nanjing would end with it.' \\nThe article ends with an excitement: 'The ordinary people have lived the bitter days of no rice, firewood and lack of oil, really can't survive. But they also found another new hope, and they were talking about the post-liberation opening, and the white face was a dime and a pound. In Jinan after liberation, order was restored three days later. They don't feel out: the Communist Party is coming soon! Indeed, they are biting their teeth and endure the darkness before dawn. \\nThis article, which was certainly exciting at that time, could not be sent to the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po for publication. Because, just as she had just completed the first draft of this article, late November 16, the agent broke into her house in the name of checking her account and arrested her. Marx has a famously saying: 'When he is afraid, he is terrible.' At that time, Chiang Kai-shek felt the fear of being overthrown, and he was scared, so he stepped up his repression. On this day, he issued a general martial law. Pu xixiu became one of those arrested under this martial law order. \\nInitially, Pu Hee Xiu was detained at the capital garrison headquarters. Several female students from the Central University and Jinling Women's University, who were arrested on the same day, were in prison with her. She was frankly and felt that there was no big deal except for a death. Two children have been taken by their father and are not involved. She also remembered Rolongi, and always felt that it was a little bad to do with him, and now it was fine, and could be a hundred from now on. It is also an infinite honor to sacrifice for the revolution. \\nAt the garrison headquarters, she was interrogated twice. For the first time, he asked the name, age, origin, occupation and whether he was a member of the Communist Party; the second time, the letters, diaries, documents, etc. searched from her house were extracted and questioned in detail. They did not find any evidence, because she was just sympathetic to the Communist Party, was not happy with the Nationalist Party, and there was nothing they were looking for. \\nChen Mingde managed to visit the prison and told her that he was trying to rescue, but things were not easy. She said very serene to Chen Mingde: 'This time I probably won't escape the enemy's poisoners.' It shows a generous determination to die. \\nIn early December, Pu xixiu was transferred to the secret prison of the Nanjing Gendarmerie Command. The situation here is much worse than the garrison command. Two people a small black cell, bunk. A small skylight on the top of the cell can penetrate a little light. In the evening, the big iron gate was overlooked, and only the shackles coming from other cells were heard. It is also not allowed to meet with those visiting outside the prison. \\nThe situation in prison, the young doctor who was held together at that year, recalled: 'At the Gendarmerie Command Prison, Sister Pu and I were in a female cell of less than six square meters, and she slept under my bunk. The top of the cell was sealed with an iron fence and was closely monitored by armed guards around it. In the morning, everyone was rushed to the hut in the middle of the trumpet washed with cold water, down the barrels. Three meals a day are sent by guards from a small door hole that can only see half the face of the cell. Pu Da sister has a bad stomach, often cough, her health is greatly damaged. Together with the blockade of the KMT agents on outside news, for a long time no one gave her something to come in, life was unusually painful and cough worsened day by day.' \\nIn this prison where political prisoners are held, he was held here at the same time as Pu xixiu, editor Chen Zitao, Luo Hemin and manager Wu Chengde (aka Wu Ernan), and Lu Zhiying, a comrade in charge of the Shanghai Underground Party of the Chinese Communist Party, who was arrested for betraying traitors. One day, Pu xixiu heard the voice of Lu Zhiying: 'Pu xixiu, I know you.' Despite not being able to meet, he sent her a lot of notes from male jail and many poems he wrote. He wants everyone to be confident that the revolution will prevail. Encouraged by the Communist Party's hard friends, Pu xixiu sentiment became more revitalized. These political prisoners, often in their talks, envisage a joyful celebration when the PLA came to open the door. Lo Chi-ying heard that Puxi Xixiu cough overnight, also told the prison guards to send her a bottle of cod liver oil. She was touched by this tribulation concern. \\nLo Chi-ying also has the ability to act. He buys through prison guards, and often brings him some books and magazines. In this way, they are in prison with a general understanding of the situation outside. \\nSister Jie Xiu was anxious to see the news of Xi Xixiu's arrest from the World Daily. She ran from Beiping to Shanghai and found Rolongi and asked him to try to rescue. Luo estimates that this is serious and the rescue will not succeed. In order to do his personnel, he still wrote many letters to Nanjing's right. Some of the letters were received by Jiehsiu to Nanjing and delivered to the recipient by her father himself. To send the letter, some people refuse to receive them, and some hypocritical pervades. Zhang Daofan said to ask 'Likong', while Chen Lifu said he would also investigate. Some people even scolded Puxi. The father saved her heart, still perseverably went to the door of these people every day to plead. In his impression, only Shao Lizi's attitude should be considered good. He honestly said: the ruling faction refused to let people go, and hurry is not useful. Jie repair could not think of any way, he went back to Beiping. \\nLuolongi also thought of going to Nanjing to rescue, but there is no door trail, get bad, he will be caught up. Zhang Qianhua, a member of the political party who met in an interview with Chongqing, was a legislator at this time. He also ran for the rescue of Puxi Xixiu, and there was no result. The official response was that she had to be arrested several times without having caught it, and now it would never be released easily. Pu xixiu was in prison, and did not know the rescues outside. \\nThe arrest of Pu xixiu also affected the actions of Lorongi. At the end of 1948, Yip was instructed to persuade Zhang Lan and Lorongki to go to Hong Kong, and said there were ways to help them leave Shanghai safely. Lorongi said: 'Puxi Xiu is now in jail, and I must be tired of her as soon as I leave.' refused to go. And Zhang Lan's attitude is: 'Nuosheng (Luolongji word), go to me, nu live not go to me nor go.' Nor refused to go. Soon, Zhang Lan and Lorongki were closely monitored by KMT agents and lost their freedom of movement and were in danger. \\nOn the battlefield of Huaihai, on November 22, Huang Baitao Corps was set up; on December 15, Huang Wei Corps were all set; and the three regiments of Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi and Sun Yuanliang led by Du Yuming were already in re-encirclement, waiting for the fate of annihilation. Chiang Kai-shek has no war soldiers. In the face of death, he seemed even more violent and ordered the massacre of political prisoners. On December 25, when Pu xixiu were delighted to be released from jail for victory, Lu Zhiying's fetters were opened and he was taken out at more than 10 o'clock in the evening. Puxi xiu thought, it was about open and night trial. People don't want to sleep and want to wait for him to come back. Time passed an hour and an hour, and later, when he heard a jailer in his cell packing up things, followed by an unbalanced quarrel, he knew that he would never come back again. In order for Lu Zhiying to be killed, she was unable to eat and sleep well for a few days. Two days later, Chen Zitao and Luo Hemin from Wen Cui Weekly were also killed in this way. \\nIn 1949, the warden gathered these political prisoners and read Chiang Kai-shek's peace statement to them. There is a big change in the political situation. Pu xixiu thought, about about to release it. Certainly, the same men have been released successively, and only two or three are left in the female prison. \\nOn January 21, Chiang Kai-shek announced his retreat, with Lee Tsung-Jen acting as President. On that same day, the political prisoners held in the Gendarmerie Command were removed. Some were transferred to other places of detention and others were killed. Wu Chengde of Wencui Weekly was killed this day in Ningbo. Pu xixiu and another ten individuals were taken by the gendarmes to a large truck and sent to the Military Court of Sheepskin Lane. She thought that, at the time of their last day, someone would be willing to do something good, asking the escorted gendarmerie to call her father and tell him that she had been transferred here. The father received the phone call and came to see her the next day. She felt that the guardianship here was no longer as close as the Gendarmerie Command. \\nIn order to make a gesture of good-faith peace talks, Li Zongren ordered the release of political prisoners on January 26. At this time, Luo Longji's friend Qiu Changwei, who was studying in the United States, was Li Zongren's closest staff member. Luo went on to help. Qiu took Li Zongren's business card to the gendarmerie headquarters VIPs. After a few weeks fold, to the 28th, Qiu Cai put Puxi repair out. This day coincides with the thirtieth year of the Great Year: New Year's Eve. Qiu Changwei gave her a flight ticket and she immediately arrived in Shanghai. \\nOn January 31, Fu Zuoyi Ministry moved all out of Beiping, by the People's Liberation Army (PLA), into the city to receive defense. Beiping declared peaceful liberation. Pu xixiu wanted to go to Beiping immediately via Hong Kong, but Lolongki repeatedly asked her to stay and walk with him. He said, 'The Chinese Communist Party sent people several times to ask me to come to Hong Kong, but I can't have to leave you and go alone. Now wait for me to convince the old table (Zhang Lan word table), when I put the lung disease special needle, we go together.' Lorongi and Zhang Lan lived in the Hongqiao Sanatorium. \\nPu xixiu had to stay. Beginning, Loronki introduced her stay in Han Ming for some days. Han Ming has been a reporter for the New People's Daily, doing business in Shanghai. Later, Luo introduced her to live in the home of a Wang surnamed industrialist. The owner is not home, only Yang surnamed couple to watch the door. She wants to go and can't go, live here, that anxious and bored mood is really unspeakable. When Lolongki, they"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": " had done their preparations, really wanted to go, how could Pu xixiu not go. At this time, Nanjing has been liberated. She wants the liberation of Shanghai to be just around the corner. She wants to welcome liberation in Shanghai. If we depart from Hong Kong, I don't know what day before going to the liberated area. She insisted that Loronki they did not go. \\nUnexpected this delay would be in trouble. On May 10, Zhang Lan and Lolongki were arrested by agents. The Kuomintang wants to take them to Taiwan. Now it is Pu Heisu to rescue Loronki. She went to Wang Ana (Wang Bingnan's wife), asked her to try, no result. She felt that living in Wang's family name, almost lost all contact with the outside world. It was not a matter, and moved to the family of old lady Chen Bizen, Yufeng's mother, to live. At this time, she often followed Peng Wen to go to the U.S. Consulate to listen to the news. Zhang Lan and Luolongji were not rescued until May 27, the day of the liberation of Shanghai. \\nPu Xi repair is to meet liberation in Shanghai as he wishes. \\nV. Adapting to the new era\\nOn June 24, 1949, Puxi Xixiu, along with Zhang Lan, Luo Longji and other people arrived in the liberated Beiping. \\nBefore leaving Shanghai, Wen Wei Bao had just been republished in Shanghai. Because Pu xixiu had a source of writing 'Nanjing Communications' for the Hong Kong edition of Wen Wei Po, Xu Zhucheng valued her talents and asked Qin Benli to send her an offer to set up and host an office in Beiping. After reaching Beiping, Chen Mingde and Deng Jixing asked her to return to the New People. And Hu Yuzhi and Sakon thought that she was a member of the NLD, should go to the Democratic Party newspaper, Guangming Daily, which was just launched on June 16, and is in need of people. She was excited, not only was the threat of unemployment gone, but there were three jobs to choose from. \\nThe New People's Daily, of course, is the deepest relationship, but the labor dispute in the Times is serious. Pu xixiu is a person who has close ties with the capital, and in nominal terms, is even one of the shareholders (she obtained a share of the newspaper staff according to seniority and contribution), felt that the relationship was not good to deal with, and only did one. Month will not go. \\nGoing to the Guangming Daily, she discussed with Lorongki, Luo thought that things within the Union were not good, this newspaper was not easy to do well, and did not advocate her going. She thought it was also, when she joined the alliance, had taken a senseless attitude, and now the revolution had won, what would the democratic parties do? Nor should she do one thing about her status as an 'ally.' Lorongi favoured her to engage in the Beiping office of Wen Wei Bao, and this was so decided. \\nOn September 21, 1949, the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference opened in Beiping. The meeting decided: People's Republic of China Dingdu Beiping, and renamed Beijing. Pu xixiu attended the event as a representative of the press. She met the leaders of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai. When someone introduced her to Mao Zedong, Mao said, 'You are a female reporter who has been sitting in the class room!' Makes her feel incredibly excited and cordial. \\nXu Zhucheng is also a press representative attending the New CPPCC. Early in September, he came to Beijing in advance from Shanghai. On September 10, he and Puxi Xixiu went to Dengshikou Chaoyang Hutong on the 3rd to see the house and decided to rent it for the Beijing office. He handed over 60,000 yuan to Pu xixiu for urgent use, and the rest will be sent by Shanghai again. During these days, she was going to attend meetings, write news and newsletters to newspapers, and to get the office started, and did not know how she was busy. At the time Xu casting diary can see the situation:\\nSeptember 25, 1949: 'See the 22nd and 23rd Japanese newspaper, (CPPCC meeting), on the opening day of the special telegraph were published on the same day, and the 'Big Communiqué' and 'Liberation Daily' were not seen, and Xi Xixiu's efforts and work experience.' \\n29th of the same month: 'To the office, it has been painted and furniture has not yet been purchased. Xi intends to hire two messengers, a chef, a maid, another reporter, a paper, and expropriation of comments. When the order is handled in full power, and please search for journalists.' \\nAccording to Chongqing Xinmin Daily colleague Han Xinru recalled: 'Remember to see her for the first time after liberation was in a conference interview at the Dongdan Youth Palace Theatre in Beijing. She has left Xinmin as Director of Wenhui's Beijing office. I work in a Beijing newspaper. She said to me: 'Now that the Kuomintang has been defeated and the nation is liberated. We, those of us who struggled a deadly death struggle with the KMT reactionaries in Chongqing at that time, know more than ordinary people how hard new China is coming, and we really should redouble our efforts. '' Pu xixiu works with such a mindset, and it is not surprising that he can have such high energy and such high efficiency. \\nNow, she has a career in which she can play her talents, and with stable living conditions, the issue of her relationship with Loronki is highlighted. Luo's talent and grace had long made her dump. The common struggle in the democratic movement against KMT rule has increased friendship. Just because of his appearance, she eventually divorced from Yuan Ziying, who already had two children. After his arrest, he managed to rescue many parties. Finally, he was able to find someone rescued. It was a person who could suffer together. Because he wanted to stay in Shanghai and other liberation, he was also accompanied by not walking, so he was in danger, visible to their feelings... Both people had intentionally married, previously were not permitted by the environment, and now liberated, conditions changed radically, according to say they want to marry, there is no longer any obstacle. However, they were not married. On this, she said in her autobiography: 'The relationship with Loronki is also a major pain after my liberation. My friends don't agree, my sister is against Yuli, and both of my children do. I reconsidered this again, and I didn't want to marry him, nor did he want to marry me either. But because of years of affection, we maintain a relationship with friends.' \\nShe said it simple. The mourning of her daughter Donglin speaks in detail: 'It is now necessary to talk about Mr. Lorongi. I saw him in Nanjing in 1947. Since the Kuomintang broke down the CPPCC peace talks agreement, the delegation of the Chinese Communist Party withdrew successively, and since then there has been less a place where she can often walk and talk about their hearts. The property left behind by the CCP delegation was entrusted to the NLD Central Committee for acceptance and custody, and the NLD would take this task in great danger. At this time, the NLD Central Committee moved to the former Chinese Communist Party delegation in Meiyuan Xincun. This demonstrates the Party's trust in the NLD and the intimacy of the two parties. Since then she often went to the NLD Central Committee, thus having a deep relationship with Luo. At that time I was in junior high school. After I went to Beijing in September 1949 from Shanghai, I knew that the three aunts and some old comrades in the party were opposed to the relationship between Niang and Lorongki. I think that the three aunts are party members and must represent the views of the Party. Of course, I will also oppose it. What about the reasons for the objection? It is now recalled that he is a 'bourgeois politician' and that his friends and relatives have little words about his character. Under the opposition of the people, the idea was contradictory, but eventually listened to the words and reconsidered his marriage. In 1952, when I was in the Changchun Air Force, she said in a letter to me that she was not ready to marry Luo, and because of years of affection, she still worked as a friend. \\nMy sister Anxiu is far from the liberated area, and there will not be much knowledge about the specific people of Lorongki, why would he 'oppose Yuli'? She objected to it because of political considerations. The words 'bourgeois politicians' are hard to hear, 'bourgeois political representatives,' which is less difficult to hear. The China Democratic League is seen as a political representative of the bourgeois. Anxiu's husband, Peng Dehuai, a member of the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee, could not accept such a link. In the memory of Pu Hee Xiu, the NLD, Lorongki, had struggled with the KMT and was also a revolutionary party; she did not know that, as early as October 27, 1947, Zhou Enlai drafted and amended by Mao Zedong, had clearly stated: 'Wait until Chiang Kai-shek and his reactionary group fought. Pour, our basic blow direction, that should turn to make the liberal bourgeois first and foremost isolated on the right wing of which Get up.' (Book 16 of the Central Archives of the CPC Central Committee, published publicly in 1992, p. 573), This instruction was sent to the central bureaux, substations and field military committees. Of course, Peng Dehuai understands the intentions of the Central Committee. Anxiu loved her sister, hoping that she would not be in a political dilemma because of marriage, of course 'against Yuli'. \\nEven the unresolved relationship with Lorongi has had a negative political impact. In her diary of October 28, 1962, she recalled that she went to visit Fan Changjiang in 1952 or 1954, 'once talked to him about joining the party. He told me to say it five years later, that's for Luo's problem'. It is clear that her relationship with Romania has become the main obstacle to her efforts to join the party. Personal feelings are small, political pursuits are big, and Luo will have to maintain a friend's relationship in the future. \\nBut, cut constantly, still mess, is sad. It is not an easy task to cut away the feelings of many years. 'In the summer of 1956, I went to Qingdao to meet, and found Huang Chunyun, a student at Qingdao University, and met Tao Qiang, who lived in the same hotel. When I and Huang and Tao three people went out to visit, and met Xixiu, such a coincidence really makes us surprise intersection... I feel that Xixiu seems to have a heart, quietly ask what makes you stuffy? She told me as frankly as ever: sister Anxiu repeatedly advised her to leave Rorongi and get married with a communist member. In fact, she and Romania had no intention to marry long ago, but her relationship with Luo has always distressed her.' \\nIt was the summer of 1956, and she was still struggling with the matter. In fact, the heavenly and sometimes enduring, this hate is inconclusive, and the end of her life, is also intolerable. \\nPu xixiu put all his heart into the Beijing office of Wen Hui Po, but one thing should be mentioned in the first half of 1950 is that she once wanted to call her to participate in the creation of the New Observation. The weekly 'Observation' published by the Kuomintang authorities on December 24, 1948, was banned by the Kuomintang authorities. After liberation, it was republished into a semi-monthly magazine for more than six months. In volume 6, No. 14, published on 16 May 1950, a Statement of Restructuring, was published, stating: 'The Observations are published until the date of this period, which ends. The company will join the reorganized semi-monthly work of New Watch. \\nOn July 1, the 'New Observation' was launched. The font of the title is exactly the same as the original 'Observations', which shows a bit of inheritance, is actually a brand new publication. In this way, an influential old publication was eliminated with what could be said to be mild. Intellectuals such as Watch say that unscrupulous journals cannot be accommodated in a new society. In preparing the New Watch, the leadership took the matter very seriously and wanted to create an influential publication to replace the original very influential one. Hu Qiaomu, director of the General Information Administration, took the four people from Pu xixiu, Goyang, Zigang and Yufeng, and asked them to do 'New Observation'. 'I think for a long time, I want to ask four women to run a popular global magazine in the future,' he said. Pu xixiu did not go, or stay in Wen Wei Bao. \\nOn June 26, 1950, Korean civil war broke out. North Korea's KPA has 200,000 troops and heavy weapons. South Korea has only 60,000 troops and no heavy weapons. The war began, the people's army was like a bamboo, and occupied Seoul for three days. By early September, KPA advanced to the outskirts of Busan, occupying most of the land on the Korean peninsula. On 15 September, United Nations troops under the command of United States General McArthur landed in Incheon, and KPA was in trouble. Stalin and Kim Il Chengdu demanded that China send troops to aid North Korea. On October 19, China 'sent a part of its troops to North Korea under the name of the volunteer army' and began a war against US aid to the DPRK. \\nOn 1 December 1950, the Central Military Commission and the Council of Administration issued a joint decision on the admission of young students and young workers to the various military cadre schools. Yuan Donglin, 17, and 15, Yuan Shijie, both signed up for the military school. Dong Lin recalled: 'In the early days of anti-US aid, my brother and I joined the army, and my mother were very supportive. I went home after enrolling in the army and told her that she also said I had a meal and asked if I was afraid she would not agree before telling her first. Remember when the radio interviewed Niang and me, she said in the radio studio with tears: 'My daughter attended the military school, but I was not able to join the revolution before liberation. ' \\nIn March 1951, Pu xixiu participated in the Chinese people's first condolences to the DPRK and entered North Korea via Tianjin, Shenyang, Andong (now known as Dandong), and went to the front line to condolences to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. It did not return until 8 May. It was an arduous and dangerous activity. Xu Zhicheng, who went to the same, recalled: 'At that time, my air force was weak, and the air control of the enemy, so it could not be active during the day, departing every night, almost going through Pyongyang. Pyongyang has become a pile of rubble. After the darkness, see the rubble and scorched sporadic houses tonight, after the next day, perhaps a little can not be found. Because the American machine is bombing the ruins every day.' 'Since I entered into the direction, I had a rare meal. At that time, North Korea was very difficult and could not fire during the day; Korean comrade hospitality was very warm, but every meal could only be cold rice, fillets, dried dishes. For the sake of preferential treatment, the cold rice was mixed with butter. I never eat fishy and beef and lamb, I barely swallow half a bowl of cold rice.' There is also danger, 'In condolences, several delegates and civil servants have sacrificed. Tianjin's famous comedian Chang Bao-Ting (stage name 'Little Mushroom'), is one of them. As for those who wade in the mountains in condolences and wounded bleeding are more difficult to count'. \\nPu xixiu, a member of the condolences team, was also a reporter. She wrote a number of DPRK newsletters, which was posted in newspapers, and later published in co-authored with Xu Chusheng and others for the book 'Return to North Korea'. Fifty years later, the causes and history of this war are already known to the Chinese people. Let's look at these reports published that year, and it is not difficult to find out what is wrong. Here is just one of the most irrelevant examples. In his article 'The Heroic and Lovely People of Korea', Puxiu said the results of the KPA's near-guard team: they 'had hit Lok Dong River, and later the US troops landed in Incheon, and they continued their guerrilla war behind the enemy. They also captured 5,000 US troops after the enemy. Last December, they finally met with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Lianchuan. This figure is a big problem. Volunteer Political Department director Dupin said in a book 'At the volunteer headquarters' that during the North Korean armistice talks, North Korea and China submitted the figures of prisoners of war to the US side, 3193 US troops and 1216 troops of other countries. The two totals were only 4409. This is the total number of US troops and other armies captured by China and North Korea during the entire war. How could a force of the People's Army (KPA), close guard team beat the guerrilla captive of US troops for several months after the enemy? Such an article cannot be seen as an accurate account of the facts, but merely promotional material for the purpose of encouraging morale. \\nOn July 16, 1951, Pu xixiu along with a part of the condolences to the North Korean condolences to Dihua (now known as Urumqi), to convey. She also wrote some Xinjiang newsletters during this period. In the article 'Dihua Impression', wrote that 'the Rusu oil mine and non-ferrous metal ore have also started construction', which was written as an achievement and a good event worth publicizing. What is said here is the implementation of the Agreement on the Establishment of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company in Xinjiang and the Agreement on the Establishment of Sino-Soviet Nonferrous and Rare Metals in Xinjiang, signed in Moscow on March 27, 1950. This is not a happy event. Khrushchev said this in his memoirs: 'Stalin signed a decision with China to mine jointly in Xinjiang. Stalin was wrong to do so. I can even say that this is a shame for the Chinese. For centuries, the French, the British, and the Americans have exploited China, and now the Soviet Union has followed. Stalin's approach was bad, but not without precedent: he established similar 'alliances' companies in Poland, Germany, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Romania, and we later eliminated them all.' He said that 'all these companies were canceled,' he said, was when he took part in China's National Day in 1954 in his capacity as the first secretary of the CPC Central Committee. He met with Zhou Enlai and signed a number of documents, including a Joint Communiqué on the issue of the existing Sino-Soviet Joint Stock Company, which decided to transfer all Soviet shares in the said joint-stock companies to China from January 1, 1955. After the transfer, the above companies were changed to Xinjiang Petroleum Corporation and Xinjiang Nonferrous Metals Company respectively. \\nRecall those 'Nanjing Communications' written by Pu xixiu for Hong Kong's 'Wen Hui Bao' in 1948, really can be said to be a torch of eyes. Observation and analysis can really be said to be three points into the wood. After many years, reading can feel its angry and historical value, fully demonstrating the talents of a political journalist. Now we have encountered such topics as the Korean War and Sino-Soviet relations, but we can only write such articles that can not stand the test of time! If we look at it from another point of view, these articles, although they cannot show her overt observation and strength, they fully demonstrate her wholehearted love to the party. Each article, every sentence, is fully consistent with the propaganda reporting requirements of the central public information department at that time. She consciously volunteered to write this inspiring spirit. Morale promotional materials as their duty. \\nWhat Pu xixiu did not think is that despite her efforts to write and engage in reporting according to the intent of the leadership, the leadership is not satisfied with this 'Wen Wei Po'. At that time, the Kuomintang was not satisfied with the newspaper, by blocking it. Now, however, it is not advisable to use this fierce means of blocking this newspaper, which has been helpful in the past and has a great reputation and influence among its readers, but intends to eliminate it in a more modest way. The first proposed programme was to transform Wen Wei Po into an organ of the Youth League. Director Hu Qiaomu of the General Information Administration also introduced Xu Zhucheng to the Central Committee of the Mission for talks with Liao Chengzhi and Rong Gaotang. On the application, Xu Zhucheng had no choice to give up the words 'Wenhui', and did not speak up the results. Wen Wei Po continues to go out. \\nIn this case, the Beijing office is also very bad. 'Before the public-private partnership in 1953, Wen Wei Po was a privately owned newspaper, offering and advertising costs were dwarfed, and Yan Baoli, general manager of financial management and management, was also in trouble. This has caused difficulties to Pu Hee Xiu, who hosts the North Office. She once wrote such a letter to Yan Baoli: 'In September, a total of 1 million yuan was received in remittances, and the expenditure was 1.7 million yuan. In addition to all my salary, I also pulled a lot of debt. ''\\nThe first plan to eliminate Wen Wei Po was not accepted by Xu, so the second was designed. In 1953, newspapers were instructed to focus mainly on primary and secondary school teachers and high school students. Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education and the leadership of the municipal party committee all participate in the editorial board, the field section adjusted to education (higher schools), small and secondary education, general news and other groups. Changed from a folio newspaper to two. Most of the pages contain guidance materials for teachers in primary and secondary schools, leaving only one edition to publish a comprehensive current affairs brief. Registration is not changed, but the nature is changed. This was the first step towards moving to Beijing for publication. \\nIn September 1954, Xu Zhucheng was elected representative of Guangdong Province to Beijing to attend the first session of the First National People's Congress. During this period, he and the head of the Ministry of Education have repeatedly discussed the concrete steps to move to Beijing for publication of the Teacher's newspaper and made a general decision. Relevant leaders also took into account the issue of the whereabouts of some people in Wen Wei Po. Party member deputy editor-in-chief Qin Benli and Xu Zhucheng were transferred to the People's Daily. He wanted to transfer Pu xixiu to China Youth Publishing House to compile the Traveler magazine. Li Geng, president of China Youth Publishing House, also visited the office in person. For this matter, Li Shu also wrote to Xu Zhucheng requesting him to facilitate the movement. This aspect naturally values the talents of Pu xixiu. On the one hand, it also feels that after the change to the Teachers Newspaper has reduced the size, it can't put such a big general. \\nIn April 1956, Wen Wei Po was discontinued, and on May 1, 'Teacher's Daily' was launched in Beijing. A daily newspaper became a professional newspaper published twice a week. Xu Zhucheng became the editor-in-chief of the Teacher's newspaper. In his memoirs, he said: 'I only have to go to the newspaper hall for 4 days a week to read and review the draft, and the rest of the time, I can study myself at home and take a short tour of the Beijing suburbs. This is the most leisurely time of my life.' The words are unfurious, rather subtle, but also expose the resurrection of the meat. Someone saw his emotion. His memoirs wrote down the following thing: 'Around the beginning of June \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), Brother Yao Qin, who was then deputy minister of the Ministry of Public Information of China, visited the Teacher's newspaper. And he said to me, 'What are your emotions about your current work?' I said, 'The mood is very good. I have peace of mind to make the Teacher Newspaper a job for the second half of my life. ' And he said with a smile, 'I don't fully believe that. How can people who always practice daily newspapers, two issues a week of professional newspapers, make you addicted? '' After all, Yao Qin is an intellectualist and understands the intellectuals' cause. He has seen that the 'Teacher's newspaper' is not enough to give effect to Xu's aspirations. Does Puxi Xixiu, who worked in the Teachers Newspaper, also have such a mood? \\nSix, 'capable female generals'\\nIn February 1956, when the Soviet Union held its 20th Congress, Khrushchev criticized Stalin with a reference to personal worship and began to expose Stalin's massive repression of innocent people. For the first time, a leader raised the issue of the flaws of Soviet model socialism. \\nIn April, Mao Zedong made a speech at the Expanded Politburo Conference of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, proposing to explore a different development path from the Soviet Union. In his concluding speech at the meeting, Mao Zedong made a speech: 'The art issue is full of flowers and hundreds of disputes on academic issues. I think it should be me 'The policy.' \\nOn May 26, Lu Dingyi, Minister of Propaganda of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, delivered a speech to 2,000 intellectuals in Huairentang, on the topic of 'Flowers in the Arrange, Hundreds of People's Disputes', advocating that 'there is freedom to think independently in literary and artistic work and scientific research work, freedom of debate, freedom of creation and criticism, and publication. The freedom to own opinions, stick to one's own opinions and keep one's own opinion.' \\nPeople gradually feel that in the ideological sphere, there is a little more liberal meaning. It is against this background that Wen Wei Po has an opportunity to republish. After the republication, Pu xixiu said in the Autobiography: 'I and Xu Zhucheng live in the city and go to the Teachers' Daily to work. We think the Teachers' Newspaper is a 3-day journal, and it is a professional newspaper. It is not enough for so many people to have people's education society. Later Yan Baoli entered the city also talked about this matter. We would like to reflect this opinion to the Ministry of Public Information. The three of us were met by Zhang Jichun. After we said the above opinion, we asked whether Wen Wei Po could consider republishing, but if Zhang Jichun could actually consider it. After some days, I called again to ask Zhang Jichun to consider the result. Zhang said: Take the editorial policy of 'Wen Wei Bao' republished! I told Xu Zhucheng that Xu used a lunch time to draw up. Xu Zhucheng and I went to meet Zhang Jichun that afternoon. Zhang fully agreed, so Wen Wei Po actively prepared the republication. Xu Zhucheng borrowed Qin Benli to the People's Daily in lieu of Zhang Shuren back to Shanghai to prepare for republication. Xu Zhucheng told the Beijing office staff arrangements that I could find elderly people such as Qin Liufang and Wang Yijin, because I was not Wenhubo before liberation, so I did not know, I did not go to find. But Meiduo and Yang Zhongye and other elderly people asked to enter Wen Wei Po, and I asked Shichin Benli to agree. After the republication of Wen Wei Bao on October 1, Shanghai called a long-distance telephone call, saying it had hit a fire. That means selling is very good, more than 100,000 copies.' \\nThe history of the republication of this matter in Wen Wei Po, Xu Zhucheng's memoirs described in more detail, he talked about the role of Deng Tuo. Denton has a more open and accessible vision for newspaper work. He once said to Xu Zhucheng: 'I think it is a pity that Wen Wei Po is suspended. It has characteristics that can't be replaced by other newspapers.' He fully sponsored the republication of Wen Wei Po. He returned Qin Benli to Wen Wei Bao at the request of Xu Zhusheng. Xu also contributed a lot of good opinions when he drafted his speech policy after the republication of Wen Wei Po. \\nAfter the republication of Wen Wei Bao, Pu xixiu was arranged as one of the six deputy editors to chair the Beijing office. After the republication of Wen Wei Po, according to the policy of the hundreds of flowers, the news is fresh and popular with readers. \\nIn 1956, it should be mentioned that at the 2nd National Congress of the China Democratic League, held in February, Pu xixiu was elected as an alternate member of the Central Committee. That is, Zhang Bojun and Rolongi were elected vice-presidents of the NLD Central Committee. On February 27, 1957, Mao Zedong said at the Supreme State Council how to deal with intra-people contradictions. In March, the Communist Party of China's national propaganda work conference was held in Beijing. Of the more than 800 participants, there were more than 160 professionals involved outside the party. Xu Zhucheng was also invited to come to the conference from Shanghai. On 10 March, Mao Zedong met with some representatives of the press and publication community. He expressed his appreciation for the recently republished Wen Wei Po. Xu Zhucheng recalled: 'Comrade Yongzhi and I rushed to the residence of Chairman Mao in Zhongnan Hai. Chairman Mao was accompanied by Kang Seng to greet visitors at the door of the living room. When I went up, he held tightly with me with warm hands, and said, 'You 'Wen Wei Po' is doing well, with chess and calligraphy, flowers and birds and fish, it's all. The orchestration is also excellent. After I get up every afternoon, I will first look at Wen Wei Po, and then look at the People's Daily, which is available, and then turn over another newspaper.' \\nDuring the discussion, Mao expressed his affirmation of the discussion on film issues held in Wen Wei Po a few days ago. He said: 'This criticism of the film is very useful, but the film bureau does not open the door enough, their articles have a tendency to affirm everything, people criticize and close the door to death. I look at the questions raised by most critical articles, which are useful for reforming our films. Now the movie, I don't like to watch, of course there are good, do not negate everything. Criticism whatsoever is true, the Film Board must accept, otherwise the film work cannot be improved. The articles published in your newspaper, criticism in the first period, certainly more in the second period, can now organize articles to unify them, good affirmations, bad criticism. It is wrong to ignore the film bureau. The debate exposes problems and benefits both the film bureau and the people who write articles.' \\nXu Zhucheng recalled: 'It was about 1 hour to meet. Finally, Chairman Mao also shook a farewell with the participants. After leaving the Zhongnanhai Sea, I called the Beij"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "ing office of the car direct-running light shikou to all reporters to carefully repeat the details of this meeting to let everyone share my joy and happiness. Everyone pushed Yao Fangzao to record the word. After I reviewed it, the same night was sent to Shanghai this newspaper. Not only caused a sensation in Wenhui, but outside people such as Mr. Zhou Gucheng also came to watch. \\nThe two congresses, which were held successively, have continued to discuss and expose conflicts within the people across the country. Flowers were laid down, some traditional dramas on the stage were banned; hundreds of counsels, academia made some sharp arguments. Various newspapers reflect this in varying degrees. Wen Wei Po can probably be considered the most conscious and hardest family, Xu Zhicheng should contribute all his power in the implementation of Mao's new policy, in order to repay Mao's appreciation and knowledge. \\nAt this time, Xu Zhucheng received even more attention than his own expectation, and he was arranged to head the delegation of Chinese journalists to the Sudan. Originally he heard of being a deputy head of mission, later he knew that he was the head. He also learned that Pu xixiu was scheduled to take part in a press delegation to visit Czechoslovakia in September, and Yao Fangzao, as a reporter, went to Hungary to attend the International Youth Festival in the second half of the year. All three international events were attended by people from Wen Wei Po, which is seen in the face of Wen Wei Po. \\nThe national propaganda work conference ended on March 12. Only half a month later, on the 27th, Xu Zhu Achievement led the delegation departed for the Soviet Union, and did not return to the country until May 9. After returning home, he was busy writing 'News on a visit to the Soviet Union', and did not immediately capture the work of the newspaper. \\nOn April 15, Pu xixiu also departed for Heilongjiang as a member of the National People's Congress (CPPCC), delegation to visit Heilongjiang until May 20. \\nIn the time when both of them left their jobs, the situation has evolved again. One major event was that the CPC Central Committee issued the Directive on the Breeze Movement on May 1, pushing the ongoing 'revelation' to a new climax, and the newspaper layout was even more lively. Another bigger thing was what they would not know at that time, was Mao Zedong's determination to fight against the right in mid-May. The party has followed his secret article, 'Things are changing' and several related instructions, in a calmly arrangement. \\nOn June 8, the People's Daily published an editorial 'Why Is This?' Officially declared the beginning of the anti-right struggle. \\nLater in an exotic material written in 1968, Pu xixiu recalled the situation: 'On May 20, 1957, after I returned to Beijing from Northeast China, because I spent a week to organize the visit materials, and then the impact of the office reporter was great, and I had no intention to sort the materials. 5 On May 27, I was in charge of the work of the office again, and then made a series of mistakes, such as issuing Liu Guanghua's 'North University's Democratic Wall', and agreeing to issue the fallacy of the 'Party World' of Chu Anping. 'On June 8, after the publication of the People's Daily editorial, 'This Is Why', I called Lu Ding again to ask if I received it. On the 9th, my mind was sober. Qin Benli, the party group of Shanghai 'Wenhui', made a long-distance telephone call, and asked me to go to Shanghai. I went to Shanghai on the 10th and returned to Beijing on June 20. \\nIn the middle of Pu xixiu's brief stay in Shanghai, on June 14, the People's Daily fired the first heavy artillery shells at Wenhui Po. An article published in the newspaper this day, 'The direction of the bourgeois in a period of time', signed the 'Editorial Department of this newspaper', in fact, Mao Zedong's hand. He criticized Wen Wei Po and Guangming Daily on the ground of reproducing a short article by Yao Wenyuan, saying, 'The basic political direction of these two newspapers has, in a short period of time, become the direction of bourgeois newspapers. The two newspapers, using the slogan '100 contests' and the Communist Party's rectification campaign, published a large number of articles and inflammatory reports that express bourgeois views without preparing criticism.' \\nWen Wei Bao certainly felt the weight of this criticism, and the newspaper opened a general meeting of the staff to accept the criticism. Pu xixiu spoke at the meeting. She said that China Propaganda Department is caring for 'Wen Hui Po'. For the bourgeois tendencies at this time, we need to adopt a formula of unity-criticism-unity, change it wrong, not to fluctuate emotions, to stand the test, and said that he also received a lot of education. \\nBack in Beijing, Pu xixiu wrote an article 'Delineating the Boundaries, Participating in Fighting'. He said to draw the boundaries with Zhang Bojun, Luolongji, and Chuan An equal right-wing elements. In the article, she also defended with a frank mood that, 'Wen Wei Bao' is completely a newspaper of the people and has received unlimited care and help from the Party. Help, the editorial policy after republished last October was also fully helped by the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee 'It was said that Wen Wei Po and Loronki related, which is not true'. She sent this text to Peng Dehuai before it was sent to the Guangming Daily for publication. This article, the statement is false, the justification is real, of course, can not be masked. \\nA few days later, came a heavier blow. On July 1, the People's Daily published an editorial written by Mao Zedong, 'The bourgeois direction of Wen Wei Po should be criticized'. This editorial is far more than criticizing a newspaper. It is an official statement of the Chinese Democratic League (Zangluo League), which is mainly represented by Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji. Mao said in this editorial: 'The NLD played a particularly bad role in the process of contention and in the process of winding. Organisations, plans, programs and routes are all from outside the people and are anti-communist anti-socialist.' 'Throughout the spring, the Chinese sky suddenly turned black clouds, its source cover out of Zhangluo League.' Specifically, the newspaper, editorial said: 'Wen Wei Po' implemented the NLD central anti-socialist policy of anti-communist anti-socialism in the spring, and held a rampant offensive against the proletariat, contrary to the Communist Party's policy. In order to bring guilt to specific people, the editorial wrote an astonishing paragraph: 'What is serious is Wen Wei Po's editorial department, which was handsome printed during the reporting bourgeois direction, heavy burden and not easily relieved. Handsome on handsome, the attacker said there, the defendant said none; and named his name, saying it was Luo Lorongki in the Confederation of Zhang Luo. There is also a handsome between the two handsome, that is, Pu xixiu, head of the Wen Hui Po office in Beijing, is a capable woman. People say: Lorongji-Puxi Xixiu-the editorial office of Wen Wei Po is such a NLD right-wing system in Wen Wei Po. \\nTo Xu Zhucheng, there is still a little love, just to replace it with the words 'Wen Wei Po' editorial department, although people can clearly say who is, at first glance, it is still not clear. Pu xixiu is completely unmerciful. When Mao wrote this editorial, of course, he fully understood Puxi Xixiu's private relations with Lorongki, so the wording is so. However, the majority of readers did not understand their relationship, so the People's Daily published China Junwu's comic, 'Don't Hold the Lute Half Cover', which interpreted it. \\nPu xixiu has since assumed the responsibility of commenting on this editorial. She must account for her relationship with Loronki, her understanding of Lorongki, how he can control and direct Wen Wei Po through her. She was questioned around these topics during several symposia that criticized her. \\nAs a member of the Chinese delegation, Lorongi left Beijing on June 3 to attend the meeting of the World Peace Council in Colombo and faced such a situation as soon as he returned to Beijing on the 22nd. On 25 June, he attended an expanded symposium of the NLD Central Group and accepted criticism. At the meeting, his old friends Fei Xiaotong, Pan Dakui, Peng Dixian and Ye Duyi were all instructed to make critical statements. Pu xixiu was also notified to the meeting. In her speech at the meeting, the People's Daily reported: 'Pu xixiu defended Lorongi at the meeting. She talked about what he had not talked to her after her return from abroad. Puxi said Lorongi has no relationship with Wen Wei Po. She acknowledged, however, that only once in the Lorongi family, members of the various democratic parties had been invited to eat to discuss the work of Wen Wei Po and generally consulted. To Ye Duyi expose that Lorongi would not allow Lorongi to listen to the words of the party group of Wen Wei Po, and that something went to Beijing to reflect this, Pu xixiu made such an argument for Lorongi: she understood that Loronki meant that party membership was low, he knew more. \\nOn 30 June, the third colloquium of the NLD Central Committee was held from the afternoon until the evening. The People's Daily report said: 'Loronki at a symposium in the afternoon to criticize his own mistakes. The evening session began with indignation and criticism of Loronki's mistakes and his unhonest representations. \\nXu Zhucheng's speech at this meeting, according to the People's Daily report, 'he began to admit that Lorongki through Pu xixiu and he used Wen Hui as a propaganda tool for opposition party leaders against socialism'. 'After liberation, Pu xixiu participated in the 'Wenbo'. I said that Pu xixiu Ken worked in Wen Wei Bao because of his relationship. It seems that he should have privileges on Wen Wei Bao since then. For several years, Lorongi removed from meeting me and used me other than, mainly through Pu xixiu to express his opinion on Wen Wei Po. Then, Xu Zhucheng said several business activities of the Beijing office, all referring to the fact that Lorongi controls Wen Wei Po. The People's Daily report said: 'After exposing a series of facts that Lorongki controls Wen Wei Wei Bo by Pu xixiu, Xu asked Pu xixiu to examine how Lorongi used the fact of Wen Wei Bo through the Beijing office of Wenhui, and asked Puxiu to quickly draw the boundaries with Loronki to expose Loronki's political plot. Pu xixiu spoke after Xu zhoucheng. Although she said she wanted to draw the boundaries with Loronki, said she wanted to 'turn from right to left', and also talked about Loronki's relationship with the US Consulate before liberation and Zhang Dongsun after liberation, but she tried hard to control the activities of Wen Wei Bai, mentioned in Xu Zhucheng's speech. conceal it. She admitted that it was wrong to say that 'Wen Wei Po has nothing to do with Lorongki', but she only said that when Wen Wei Po was republished, Zhang and Luo were very supportive. She said that she was only 'unknowingly smoked by them. ' Pu xixiu did not reveal the truth that Lorongi used her to control Wen Wei Bao. From these reports in the People's Daily, you can feel how much pressure Puxiu is under. \\nOn the evening of July 3, the NLD Central Committee held the third colloquium after the editorial publication of Mao Zedong proposed 'Lorongji-Puxi Xixiu-Wen Wei Po' Editorial Office. Hu Yuzhi, secretary-general of the NLD Central Committee, who presided over the meeting, announced that he had instructed Lorongki to make representations on four issues. The first question was 'how to control the Wen Wei Po' through Pu xixiu. The People's Daily reported that when it comes to this issue, 'Lorongki has involved many irrelevant idle things, and simply denied the serious problem that Xu Zhucheng has already revealed through Puxi Xixiu's use of 'Wen Wei Po'. Even understatement of certain important and irresistible facts as inappropriate words. When Qianjiaku raised to question him whether the People's Daily editorial criticism of Wen Wei Po was factual, Loronki said cunning, 'I don't express my opinion. Say that I do not control Wen Wei Po, you say I am cunning; admit that I am not willing to wear a hat for myself. '' The article also said: 'Pu xixiu spoke at the meeting. She read out some letters from Loronki to her, most of which had already been talked about at the journalists' symposium.' \\n'People's Daily' published an editorial criticized Wen Hui Bao on July 1. Wen Wei Wei Wei Bo published in a series of more than 10,000 words 'Our Preliminary Examination' in newspapers on the 2nd and 3rd days in the name of the 'Editorial Office of this newspaper', saying that it fully accepted the criticism of the People's Daily and republished them to All the work of the coming part is checked as an error. For example, the discussion on film work, which was praised by Mao Zedong during the National Publicity Workshop Conference, and now admits that 'we have published a lot of articles that erase the achievements of the film career since liberation', it is wrong. \\nThis 'preliminary inspection' by Wen Wei Po also accepted Mao's statement of 'Lorongji-Puxi Xixiu-the Editorial Office of Wen Wei Po'. 'The close relationship between Pu Hee and Lorongi is well known,' said. On the eve of Wenhui Po's republication last year, Luolongji asked Pu xixiu to go to Beidaihe. After the republication of Wen Wei Po, Pu xixiu implemented the reactionary view of Luolongji Zhang Bojun in his newspaper work. Pu xixiu is not close to the Party, but to ask right-wing ambitions such as Lorongji, Zhang Bojun and other right-wing ambitions to arrange the work of the Beijing office of this newspaper. She also regularly carries out 'communication' at her Beijing office. Now the examination proves that what she 'conveys' is not the instructions of the Party Central Committee, but the instructions of the right-wing elements Zhang Bojun and Lorongi. In this way, editors and reporters of the Beijing office were led to the wrong path by Pu xixiu in the execution of their work.' The Preliminary Examination also said: 'Many reporters in the news reports choose 'sharp opinions' and write less or not even positive opinions; in the case of the Beijing office, 58 special telephones were sent in May, of which 97 percent (or 56), were negative or highlighted.' This is, of course, all the responsibility of Puxiu. \\nJournalism symposia is also criticizing Puxi Xixiu. 'People's Daily' reported: 'At a seminar on journalism that continued to be held on July 4, Pu xixiu's delay, repuxiu's refusal to account for the real situation of Lolongji-Puxiu-'Wen Wei Wei Po' editorial office, the right-wing system of the NLD, was strongly criticized by everyone. In a group of indignation, Pu xixiu said she would 'honestly account of the crimes against the people' tomorrow. Speaking criticizing her at this day's meeting, there was Gaoji, director of the Western Department of the People's Daily. This hard friend who was beaten together by agents in the Shimonoseki tragedy. There were colleagues in Beijing office Mei Duo, while Chen Mingde and Deng Jixing of the New People's Daily were also jointly issued with Zhang Henshui, Zhao Chaogou and Zhang Youluan The words asked her to make good representations with Xu Zhucheng. Among the critics of these statements, in addition to three Gaoji, Zhang Hen-shui and Zhao Chaogou, several others were later classified as right-wing elements. In fact, they were also forced to make such statements under high pressure. \\nThe next day of the meeting, People's Daily reported: 'The press seminar on July 5, according to the agenda decided when the meeting ended yesterday, is to listen to Pu xixiu's' representation.' But Pu xixiu used a lot of empty words to prevaricate the questions that everyone asked for her. At the meeting, a Beijing office reporter Xie Weiming revealed: 'For more than a decade, Pu xixiu has often taken his own hands with the Communist Party's 'loyal friends'. In fact, Pu xixiu had drawn the boundaries with the Communist Party more than a decade ago. Her ex-husband Yuan Ziying had agreed with her that Yuan would not join the Kuomintang and Pu would not participate in the Communist Party. Party. At that time, Pu promised.' Wang Yunsheng of the Grand Commune also spoke. He criticized: Liu Guanghua, the son of Liu Wang Liming, has a close relationship with Luolongji. How was he absorbed into the Beijing office as a reporter? This report in the People's Daily said: 'Pu xixiu has responded to these questions, some of them have answered, and some avoid answering. At 6.30 p.m., the Chair adjourned the meeting. Next Monday to Pu Hee Shu continue to make representations.' \\n'At the journalistic symposium that continued on July 10, Pu xixiu began to make some representations.' 'People's Daily' reported: 'Pu xixiu said: After the April national working meeting of the NLD, Lorongki was very happy, saying that party members should withdraw from within the Union, and that the democratic parties can truly organize independence, political freedom, and the democratic parties have made great headlines. Pu xixiu said: Lorongi always believed that when the Minister of Forest Industry had vowed his talents. He wanted to be a minister of foreign affairs in the early days of liberation and later wanted to be a minister of justice. Now Loronki wanted to be a minister of higher education, he thinks this way to better capture big intellectuals... Pu xixiu said: Lorongi used to do everything possible for me to work in the Wen Wei Bai office, not to allow me to study and do other journals The work. On April 2 last year, Loronki sent me a letter from Moscow, saying that I don't have to be too honest in the personnel arrangements of Wen Wei Wei Bao. Last October, when Wen Wei Po was republished, he said to me: 'Wen Wei Po is a big head-on newspaper. This should be your career for your life, and no longer have to complain about placing you on my job in the Wen Wei Po office. ' Lolongji also instructed his cousin Liu Guanghua to work at the Wen Wei Po office, and to reuse Liu. Later during the whole wind, Liu Guanghua ignited everywhere. When Wen Wei Po was republished, it originally wanted to focus on middle-level intellectuals, taking into account the big intellectuals. Lorongi believed that more intellectuals would be needed to represent them and speak more for them. We have also listened to him. So Wen Wei Po at the beginning of its republication carried out the policy of the Zhangluo Union's 'sweeping' principle. Lorongi also asked us not to listen to the party group's words. We told him that the party had changed, and he said, 'Regardless of the change, the party is always a party group. ' At work, I always ask him something, we always have phone calls every day. He often defamed the party members in charge of cadres in front of me. This is why I refused to introduce party members to work in Wen Wei Bo's office.' \\nAt the press symposium on July 19, Pu xixiu was asked to continue to talk about the issue of Lorongi. She had nothing to say about anything new, but she had to repeat what had been said at the previous colloquium, but wearing a bigger hat, such as 'unconditional acceptance of the chapter, all instructions and distortions from the NLD central authority held by the RU, as the guiding ideology of the Office'. New facts, she came up with something like this: 'The anti-people nature of Loronki's opposition is consistent. Luo Chang said: Communist Party members are human beings. Mortals have fame desires, and the problems within the Party are also very many. Luo considers the high rao incident and the issue of Hu Feng all as 'sectarianism within the Party. ' Luo also said that socialism should continue to engage in labor competitions, not yet encourage people's initiative from fame and gain? What is the difference between competition and competition, I can't see. Everyone wants to climb up. Lorongi also said that he wanted to write a tragedy book with Liang Shuming as the center, and said that today why only workers and peasants are in the direction of this tragedy, after his aforesaid tragedies are written, will surely be 'shocked'. Lolongki often said: Long live the Communist Party and long live Chairman Mao are the most fleshy things. After the Hungarian incident, Romania's most prominent opinion was that the Soviet Union sent troops to Hungary was 'interfering in internal affairs', believing that it would be better to lose Hungary than the Soviet Union. During the Egyptian Resistance War last year, he said to Pu that he was skeptical about Nasser's ability to support it. Rowe also appreciated Eisenhower's approach to Egypt. Luo said: This time the United States has done pretty, has both the hearts of the people, and also seized profits. It seems that she is able to think of every sentence that Luo has said to give out. \\nThe press ended, and in August, he transferred Pu xixiu to the NLD to participate in the NLD struggle against Lorongi. On August 10, 19 and 31 August, Pu xixiu was instructed to make a statement at a meeting of the NLD Central Committee to criticize Rorongi. Mainly speaking of one thing, that is, when Li Zongren was running for vice president, Luo all supported Li Zongren. Pu xixiu read a paragraph from a letter from Lorongi to her at the August 31 meeting: 'Do not think you can't force the palace without a gun, no bullet, complex, variable. If you read history, you know that Wang Mang obtained the imperial position, and did not spend a soldier. He also did not have a soldier in his hands. When the disintegration has become, the chaos call, the world shall be four.' He said that Lee Tsung-ren might 'force the palace' to Chiang Kai-shek. However, she made a little misconception in her statement, saying, 'Lorongki wants to be king Mang', saying, 'He thinks it is now 'the disintegration has become'. As long as they are 'chaos, 'they will 'all be right', and they can usurp the leadership of the Party without spending a single soldier.' \\nEven from the materials published in the People's Daily at that time, people saw these examinations and representations, which she had done so helplessly, it was possible to imagine that she was under pressure. How did she come over this day, you can see the memories of Zhu Jiashu, a colleague from the Beijing office: 'The press anti-right will be more and more pressure and fire is getting more and more fierce. The goal is obviously to put the black line of Zhang Luo League-Puxi Xixiu-the editorial department of Wen Wei Wei Po. The guilt is so heavy that Pu's second sister is burdened and revealed the idea of seeking relief. Gaoji, Tang Hai, who presided over the anti-right movement of the North Office, were all old friends of Sister Pu II, afraid of her accident, specifically called her daughter to accompany her to prevent accidents. In this case, Sister Pu II also helped me check. At that time, I was the head of the North Office team directly under the Beijing Municipal Committee of the NLD. I determined my crime to be a member of the vicious development alliance, and pulled North Office reporters to the NLD as much as possible. She helped me on the line, saying that it was the 'League of Israelis, 'so that it can be linked to Zhang and Luo's' political conspiracy '. It is really naive Sister Pu Second, a kind Sister Pu Second. \\nThis is something more detailed about her daughter's memories of Donglin. At that time, Donglin was a 4th grade student and a member of the Communist Party of Beijing Aviation University. She says:\\n'One day, my classmates took the China Youth Daily to show me. The newspaper reported the news about the struggle, the great right, Puxi Xixiu, and the photos of the fight. I was really surprised. The deeds of her being praised by the party before and after liberation are still in sight. How suddenly turned into the Great Right? But I, who is deeply immersed in the party's bone marrow education, think that what the party says will be wrong? It must have been wrong in which way. Soon, I was informed by my parent organization (the National Book Association through the Beihang Party Committee), that I was asked to go home in order to fight the maiden and prevent accidents. I returned home, my mother had been in bed, stomach problems and insomnia had worsened in the past, could not eat or sleep, and had to write information to cope with several critical struggles every day. Mother thought, she loved the party throughout his life, followed the party, but was regarded as an enemy by the party, she was confused. She could not prove that the answer to the political formula of 'Lorongji-Pu-Xixiu, the editorial office of Wen Wei Po, is such a NLD right-wing system in Wen Wei Po. Her body and mind are suffering, and her spirit almost completely collapses and cannot survive. But she finally didn't choose that way, in order to understand that she was strong. At that time, there was a reporter of the People's Daily Gao Ji to do her thought work, prompting her to talk about the problems. Later, Wen Wei Po Tang Hai and the People's Daily, presided over the anti-right struggle at the office and did her ideological work. At home, my aunt Pu Jie Xiu followed the kindly orders of Premier Zhou, General Peng Lao and Liu Ren (Beijing Municipal Committee Secretary), to help her. Sanaunt Puan amended to study at the Central High Party School, and also took the time to enlighten her. I was at home for more than a month, and I couldn't say anything to her, but silently helped her organize her materials, like everyone, anxiously hope she came out with Loronki and pay a little attention to her sleeping pills. \\n'With the help of everyone, she had to find out the diaries and letters of the past. Everyone hastily used the political formula determined by Mao Zedong to help her find the 'problem'; and put the 'problem' in this way into this formula to illustrate her 'fault'. You are absolutely convinced that this is the best way to help her stand out with Loronki. In the situation of having formed 'Party is absolutely right at that time, there is something wrong is its own 'thinking pattern, believing that the Party is better than believing in itself, believing that the Party is better than believing in the facts, and replacing his own thoughts with faith, writing a statement once and honestly reviewing himself in accordance with the Party's requirements and expose Loronki. She hopes she will return to the embrace of the people, and also hopes that Rolongi can understand the problems pointed out to him by the party and get the understanding of the people at an early date. In this case, a communication material written by Niang was upgraded at a time than once, in order to cope with the escalating critical struggle assembly needs, the result fell deeper into the abyss of the 'great right' set by that formula.' \\nLorongi, however, did not recognize the formula and did not admit that he controlled Wen Wei Po through Pu xixiu. In the middle of his review at the fourth session of the National People's Congress, he said: 'Wen Wei Wei Bao' was a newspaper that received popularity in March and April of this year (quoted: 'People here,' he said Mao Zedong), and today was the target of anti-right struggle, mainly during the windy period, Wen Wei Bai made mistakes. This is a matter between May and June this year. In May this year, Puxi Xixiu went to the Northeast to inspect, and until she came back, I left the country again on June 3. Even if I really used Wen Wei Po to expand right-wing propaganda during the whole wind, in fact this period could not be used.' \\nAs a result of this struggle, the Beijing office of Wen Wei Po can be said to have been wiped out by the entire army. Seven of the 10 reporters classified as right-wing elements are: Pu xixiu, Mei Duo, Yao Fangzao, Xie Weiming, Yang Zhongye, Liu Guanghua, Zhu Jiashu. The remaining three as internal control elements, the hat was held in the hands of the masses. \\nIn the spring of 1958, Pu xixiu was abolished from the press, leaving only members of the National Committee of the CPPCC and alternate members of the NLD Central Committee. Her 20-year career as a journalist ended. \\nVII. Old journalist\\nAfter being classified as right-wing elements, Pu xixiu's organizational relations were transferred to the CPPCC. She can no longer live in Wen Wei Po's Beijing office. Her step-mother care helped her find a private house on the 23rd Youai Lane, Mengduan Hutong, Xicheng, Jinshefang Street. The landlord is Lv. Former wife of the KMT officer. The room is narrow, simple, and North. The advantage is that there is a small courtyard, very quiet. She was here to settle down. \\nShe must adapt and get used to this sudden change of identity, suddenly falling out from an almost boiling life. Fortunately, the father, stepmother and sister have come to visit her from time to time, giving her a little solace in her isolation and suffering. She had to endure the cold eyes of discrimination. That is her daughter, who sent letters from the internship place, wrote only 'Puxi' on the envelope. She thought, could not write comrades, no 'sir' or 'mother'? She felt sad. \\nIn July 1958, the NLD sent Pu xixiu to the Central Socialist School. She studied Mao Zedong's writings with a pious mood. She felt that only combining with workers and farmers, as Mao said, is the fundamental way to transform herself and insist that it be devolved to rural areas to work. On May 15, 1959, she went to a production team in Shijingshan People's Commune. The local farmers do not think that the right hat is his enemy, or kindly call her 'Old Pu' and asked her to participate in the production team just like anyone else. Soon, the public canteen was put up, and she was asked to work for the first half day, and the next half to help the canteen do some management work. This should be seen more as a manifestation of the absence of discrimination. In Hubei, for example, Wang Ren reformulated a charter that 'does not allow landowners, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad and right-wing elements to hold any position in the public canteens' (see People's Daily, December 20, 1958). \\nNot long, she had to return to the city to cure her stomach disease. At that time, the National Committee of the CPPCC set up a new research committee on literature and history. It was in need of people to do things. She was left and no longer returned to the pro"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "duction team. \\nAs part of the celebration, Mao Zedong wrote to the President of the People's Republic of China Liu Shaoqi, on August 24, proposing to collect caps for right-wing elements and pardon a group of criminals in phases. On September 17, the CPC Central Committee issued 'Instructions on removing the hats of rightists who really repent'. On 5 December, the People's Daily published the news that the central State organs and the central organs of the Democratic Party took off the hats of a group of rightists who had indeed changed. The news said: 'This batch of right-wing hats was announced: Huang Qixiang, Fei Xiaotong, Ye Qiqi, Lin Handa, Pan Guangdan, Pu xixiu, Xiangda, Xue Yu, Yuan Hanqing, Tao Dayong, Chen Mingde, Xie Jiarong, Fei Zhendong, Tan Zhiqing, Jin Zhixuan, Wu Wenzao, Liu Yao Zhang, Zeng Yanxiu, Wang Manshuo, Fan Chengchuan, Lei Tianjue, Yan Han, Dong Shouyi, Chen Mingshao, Qiu Zuyuan and other 142 people After removing the hat, Pu xixiu was appointed deputy chairman of the Cultural and Educational Group of the CPPCC Committee on Literature and History Research. She said to people: 'Journalists should not become, then be old news reporters.' \\nThe history of the establishment of this committee is this: On April 29, 1959, Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC National Committee, held a tea ceremony to entertain members of the CPPCC National Committee over 60 years old and called on everyone to record their personal experience and news, and pass on to future generations. He said: 'Wuxu has been the biggest period of social change in China since then. From that time to the founding of the new China, it should be documented in all aspects.' On the basis of his proposal, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), was set up on July 20 to plan, organize and promote the writing and collection of various historical materials from the end of the Qing Dynasty to the national liberation; and decided to publish the materials collected as 'Selection of Literary and Historical Materials' This work needs to be attended by an article master. Some materials have historical value, but the text needs to be processed, and even the need for writing. In this way, 'old journalist' has something to do. \\nInstitution newly built, busy business, it is the occasion of employment, she recommended to the leadership of Zigaoka. Zigang was also classified as a right-wing. She had long been a reporter with a high profile profile. As soon as the leaders heard that this was available, she transferred her to work in the cultural and educational group. On this matter, Leung Keping said this in 'Mourn': Pu xixiu 'met with a son of bad luck. She recommended Zigang to the Cultural and History Office of the CPPCC to engage in 'old news' to save Zigang from dragging legs and then falling down to the countryside. So these two fallen twin stars, together for a few years on the table and look forward to each other's day of consolation. Hee slim in adversity still try our best to help a friend, is its loyal and gentle place'. Zioka herself said slightly different from this, she said: 'Xi Xiu is really lucky-not sent to the border for forced labor, retained the title of National Committee members of the CPPCC National Committee, and in the first batch of hats (the names have been seen again!), Later, he was the deputy leader of the Cultural and Educational Group of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Although still very close, there is no round trip to each other. Just remember that, on some very occasional occasions, she stressed to me that the Committee on Literature and Historical Information had been established at the initiative of Prime Minister Zhou. She believed she had an experience in journalism and was confident in contributing to that work. She even said, 'Believe that you can also participate in the work, Zigaoka. ' She is not a prophet, but this is true. In 1960, when I worked continuously in rural areas and factories and faced decentralization, and had not yet figured out, I suddenly moved to the Committee for Literature and History as editor. The decision was made by a deputy director of the committee member. Xixiu is a small deputy leader, really can't help, she can't do anything to her heart! But coincidentally, I was assigned to her deputy team leader, and we worked in an office until 1966.' Liang Keping and Zigang said that they seem different, in fact, are not contradictory. The downward order, a small deputy leader of the hat-picking right is certainly without this power, not to help, and not to be able to do so. However, it is recommended to the deputy director of the party member who has the power to consider having such a person suitable for such a job, and redeploy it to strengthen its strength and make the work of the Literature and History Committee work faster. This is what a small deputy leader can do. When she stumbled upon Kooka and said to Kooka, 'I believe you can also participate in this work', she moved to the idea of recommending to those entitled. The words 'believe', on the one hand, indicate that she is not fully confident about the success of the recommendation, and on the one hand, that she still has a lot of confidence. She did this, said a little bigger, wanted to help a fellow old friend how to improve the situation, provide an opportunity to return to her familiar text work; said a little smaller, is to find a powerful helper for herself, let her share a share of the burden. She did nothing but something that was good for people. It is not necessary to stress that Pu Xieu does not play a role in this matter. \\nFrom Zokang's 'mourning', you can see how Puxi Xixiu worked at the Literature and History Committee in that year:\\n'The Committee on Literature and History Information is located in several rooms in the compound of organs of the National Committee of the CPPCC, which was converted from Manqing Shun to the Wangfu. The house has been repaired several times, paintings, lights and telephones, and the floor is often waxed. In short, it is gorgeous enough. But Xixiu and I have the opposite table, although it is not as dead as dead, but there was no other kind of spirited head in the interview that year. Once again, many military and political dignitaries interviewed in the 1940s in the National Unity District have gone through the stage of war criminals in the 50s, and in the 60s they became the object of the composition of literature and history materials. Among them, there are several commissioners who have leaped into literature and history materials and even members of the CPPCC National Committee. They need me and Xi Xiu to look up! I really don't understand why the Party's policy is so wide for those who were once 'outsiders', but so strict for those who were once 'their owners'?! \\n'She wanted to catch up with a few familiar senior intellectuals in business and knowledge, so she bought a lot of books and often read it late at night. But sometimes interrupting her serious reading is a mood swings that hate and curse herself. In those years, on important occasions, she always managed to avoid Premier Zhou and Sister Deng. One time was called by Comrade Xu Bing and let her see. She often miss and believe in the sincere and fierce feelings.' \\nIn January 1960, the First Series of Literature and History Materials was published, published 11 articles of length and short history. Although I do not know what work Pu xixiu did in it, think of the start-up period is not much manpower, which must have her heart. The article 'Beijing Tongren Tang Review and Prospects' published in the 11th series, is Pu xixiu's first important achievement as an old journalist. Tongren Tang is Beijing's famous long-established, founded in 1669, by that time has been nearly 300 years, operating herbs, produced cream Dan pills scattered, supply market outside, more dedicated to Royal Pharmacy. Its history is well worth summarizing. According to Yuan Donglin, this article was 'In 1960, she spent more than half a year visiting Tongrentang, personally dive into the pharmaceutical factory and counter to understand the whole process of medicine and dispensing, moving home to read a lot of Tongrentang's medicines and books and other historical materials, which took a lot of hard work and written. She thinks it was not advisable to do her own name, and Mr. Losong had several times to discuss the article according to the first person, but that was not Mr. Losong's intention. She was also interested in writing the history of Peking University, for which she read a lot of first-hand materials such as the Peking University Journal. \\nA Selection of Literature and History, Series 31, a series of articles by right-wing elements in the literary world: Song Yunbin's Enlightened Old Things-Enlightened Bookstore I Know, Fei Xiaotong's 'In English', Pan Guangdan's Early Student Life in Tsinghua, Lin Tengru's 'History of Beijing Normal University', Liu Wang Liming's 'The Beginning and End of Shanghai University', writes personal experience and Insight is a valuable first-hand information. These articles are presumably passed by Pu xixiu, a deputy leader of the cultural and educational group. These authors are familiar with, and about all are willing to pick up her contributions. \\nShe was committed to the work and tried to do it better. She also has greater ambitions. In her diary on October 28, 1962, she said: 'In the next five years, 10 years, while reading ancient books, both have a considerable foundation, to be able to make a cultural history.' In her diary of the day, she also wrote her political pursuit: 'Sister Shen (by Shen Zijiu), encouraged me to apply for membership. Today, Comrade Yangtze River made me feel obliged to do so. I had to find a chance to come up recently.' This reflects her love for the party. She does not know that on 29 September, a month before she wrote this statement, Mao Zedong made a very harsh instruction on the screening of the right, saying it was 'rampant in nature.' Pu xixiu, as a positive right, how can she realize her wish to apply for membership in the party? \\nThere is also a bad time in the work of the appointment. The diary on November 3, 1962 said: 'Xia Yan is gone, count, do not be reluctant, self-reliance and make some achievements, naturally there will be friends.' Between the lines, implicitly revealed a sense of grievance and dissatisfaction with Xia Yan. In fact, this is not (or primarily not), Xia Yen took a shelf, refusing to meet. The more important reason is that his own days are not too good. Not long ago (September 24-27), the Eighth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China proposed that class struggles should be spoken every year, month, and every day, to keep the strings of class struggles tight and tight. The novel 'Liu Zhidan' was criticized, referring to the novel anti-party. Further expand the results of the war and track down the memoirs of the revolution. Xia Yan's film 'The Revolutionary Family', based on the memoirs of the Revolution, 'My Family', was cited as a tribute to Wang Ming's route. Pu xixiu asked to meet with him in order to make an appointment and ask him to write manuscripts such as memoirs, and then of course he could not respond. Against the backdrop of growing tension in that class struggle, it is becoming increasingly difficult to organize. \\nBut she is not discouraged, not discouraged. Just a few days after attending the fourth session of the third session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), she said in her diary on December 12, 1963: 'Social relations still need to be opened by many parties in order to be conducive to work. This meeting slightly visited some people, feel that the composition is still promising, the past circles have limited themselves, this is also the anti-right environment and mood after 1957, with the work carried out, can restore some relationships, but the main thing is to enrich themselves, self-reliance is also applied to a People's work, so-called self-help, can never be relied upon.' vaguely revealed a feeling of repression after the anti-right. \\nMy daughter Donglin talked about one thing in this time: 'In the early 60s, Dad sent me a letter from Shanghai, talking about his work unit for his deep eye myopia to retire early, and his family had four lives difficult. After knowing this situation, she wrote to many old friends in Shanghai (Cao Zhongying, Zhao Chaogou, etc.), to find a way for his father, finally found a position for him in Shanghai Mingor, can take 10-20 yuan a month to subsidize his household, but she is a matter of mind.' This is the last time she helped her past husband. At this time, she herself is in trouble, relying on the power of some old friends to do this step. \\nVIII. FINAL YEARS\\nIn October 1965, Puxi fell ill. At first, there was a polyps on the intestine, occult blood There was no timely treatment due to busy work. By December, there was pus blood and went to the hospital to test, and it was known that it was rectal cancer. She regretted that she did not remove the polyps early. She was admitted to the Beijing Hospital on 23 December, and underwent an operation on 12 January 1966, that is, to recuperate at the Xiangshan Sanatorium, and was not discharged until 7 June. \\nThis is a time when a major disease of our nation-the Cultural Revolution-has struck. On May 16, the CPC Central Committee issued a notice calling on 'the whole party to follow the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong to hold up the banner of the proletarian cultural revolution, completely expose the reactionary positions of the so-called 'academic authoritation' of anti-party anti-socialism, and thoroughly criticize academia, education, and the press. 'The bourgeois of the literary and publishing world reactionated thinking, seizing leadership in these cultural fields.' Declared the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. On June 1, the People's Daily published an editorial 'Sweeping All Cow, Ghost and Snake God', proposing 'to completely dismantle the old ideas, old culture, old customs, old habits caused by all exploitative classes for thousands of years,' and thus set off the Red Guard movement with large and middle school students as the main body, to this. 'Four old' to carry out a violent impact, gradually develop to plunge home, hit people. On August 1, Mao Zedong wrote to the Red Guards of Tsinghua University's high school, saying, 'I express my warm support to you.' Under his push, the Red Guards break the 'four old' campaign more in full swing. On August 14, the 'Decision on the Great Revolution of the Proletarian Culture' adopted by the 11th Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China was published in the newspaper, and the Red Guard movement entered a new climax. The organs of the National Committee of the CPPCC have also been shocked and unable to carry out their work. On August 30, Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the CPPCC, decided that the CPPCC National Committee organs would be suspended from today. Puxi Xixiu will have no class. \\nThis big storm struck, Puxi Xixiu's elderly father died as a result of his family scared. The brother-in-law Du Chun feast was held into the cattle shed as a 'reactionary academic authority' and died. Brother-in-law Pendhuai is of course the gangs are battered in turn Yuan Ziying was also imprisoned in Shanghai Tiganqiao Prison. \\nOn the day of August, Red Guards came to copy the home of Pu xixiu. The landlord, Mrs. Lu, who lived side by side in another small yard, was killed alive in this copy of her home. Her house became a place to stash the belongings. Puxi Xiu was scared and stunned. But she had no strength in the disease, but had to pick up her stepmother to help clean up and pack up the many books. In order to be afraid to stay and woe, those books that have been seen as treasures, burned, sold, disposed of. For such a reality, she is increasingly incomprehensible. In her diary on October 21, she said: 'At that time, she was a journalist, running around, mixed in political vortex, but didn't understand politics.' At that time, she finally realized she didn't understand politics. An innocent person who pursues his own ideals and aspirations as reality. Where can I understand how complex actual politics is! This is not a mistake made by Pu xixiu, and many intellectuals make this mistake. Even more sophisticated and conceived than her, Loronki would not admit that he didn't understand politics, but in fact, how much did he know? \\nIn such a harsh and horrible environment, by November, her rectal cancer surgery relapsed. In December, she also dragged to study in the NLD Central Organ. By March 1967, she was completely powerless to walk before stopping. \\nHospitals are also affected by the Cultural Revolution. Zigang recalled: 'As a member of the CPPCC, Xi Xixiu should have been admitted to Beijing hospital as usual, but at this time trying to stay in a municipal hospital near the CPPCC has been quite resistant. At that time, the trial leaders of the organ even asked me to write a material about Pu's foreword and action activities in the liberation, using this to determine how one person is, and then decide whether to agree to her stay in that municipal hospital.' \\nOn December 10, 1968, the medical records of the Peking Medical Affiliated People's Hospital include this page: 'Hospital No. 112936, today at 10 a.m., the ward all redues convened a general meeting and wrote a circular order to criticize the great right member Pu xixiu to discharge the hospital in the afternoon.' Fortunately, Dr. Xu in the hospital sympathized with the patient, often came to her home to treat her. She also taught her nanny Liu Sao to fight shots. This was later known to the hospital, and this good doctor was criticized for that reason. \\n'Once she was very ill, the NLD Central Committee sent Comrade Wang Jian to visit her. The only request she made at that time was that the NLD Central Committee would return her more than a dozen private letters to her, for which she had been carrying a heavy burden. The letters were returned to her with the organization's consent, and she was very grateful at that time.' At that time, Luo had died for several years, and she had no possibility to explain to him what kind of high pressure was to take out these treasured letters at that time. Knowing that life is coming to an end, it is certainly impossible to pursue the old feelings, but at least, I have to return the letters he gave me, which records the deep feelings between the two hearts. \\nAt this time, she wrote affectionate farewell letters to Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao, and also wrote an autobiography. Finally, 'I was sick for three years. When I was in hospital, people from the NLD and CPPCC still came to see me. In the second year, few people came to see me. This year seems to be isolated from the world, and even my family will not come. I know that my life is coming to an end, and I strive to complete my 'autobiography' for review by the CPPCC headquarters. I cannot respond to the latest instructions of Chairman Mao's vast cadres to decentralize labor, but I still have to study Chairman Mao's writings to transform myself.' \\nHere, she sadly said, 'Not even the family is coming,' she did not know. At that time her daughter Donglin was held in school and fought, sister Anxiu, her brother Tongxiu were also fighting to die to live. \\nIn early March 1970, the winter forest was delegated to Henan Quishan Northern Hangang 577 Main School, and went to visit the seriously ill mother. Xixiu knows that this is the mother and daughter's farewell, she tears. She knew her stomach was bad enough to be cold, and she took her old skin monkey, leather vest and mattress. This skin monkey is still through the Korean battlefield. On 19 March, she wrote a letter to her daughter:\\n'Winter Forest: You received a letter on the fourth day after you left. I just had no spirit to reply, and today decided to lift the spirit back and forth. You call me stronger, I accept your opinion. After you go, I spit more, eat milk spit, now dare to eat half a cup in the morning, another half cup in the afternoon. But I can still eat something that fits the taste, such as Grandma did the plain assortment this time, I eat very well. No one has come to see me now, only a Sunday afternoon grandmother. Treat people to buy something is difficult very. Old Zhang does not do much of the obligation. Rarely let him once, especially difficult to take medicine, he refused to go, but still Aunt Liu to go, Aunt Liu high blood pressure 190, I have no way. Your new life begins, it must be very fresh and meaningful, hoping you can revolutionize the worldview in it...'\\nThis is her pen. More than a month after writing this letter, on April 23, she died in the corridor of the emergency room of the Beijing Hospital. Only Aunt Liu was present. No relatives. A generation of newspaper people Puxi Xixiu hugged hate all day long, quietly left the world. She didn't know that Yuan Ziying died in Shanghai Tigan Bridge prison a few months earlier than her. \\nAfter Pu xixiu's death, many things have happened in China. In 1976, Zhou Enlai and Mao Zedong died, followed by the arrest of four gangs including Jiang Qing. In 1978, the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China began work on the fight against wrongs and mistakes In May 1980, the United Front Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Central Committee proposed in a document that Puxiu's right was a miscalculation. On March 19, 1981, Pu xixiu memorial service was opened in the auditorium of the National Committee of the CPPCC. The day before the memorial service, Lu Ding, who was admitted to the Beijing Hospital, wrote to Yuan Donglin and Shijie's sister:\\n'The news of a memorial service for your mother. I met your mother and she was a very savvy female reporter during the negotiations in Chongqing. At that time, the Xinmin Evening News was her, the Big Commune was a high set, and gave our party delegation a lot of help in propaganda reports. She was very impressed by the quick writing of her article, and the pen was good. We met almost every day at that time, and she had a very close relationship with my party delegation. I deeply regret that she was struck in 1957. Now give her pacification, it should be perfectly.' \\nCartoonist Hua Junwu also wrote to the Mourning Office, apologizing for his thin and light cartoons. \\nPu xixiu, a typical of 20th century Chinese intellectuals, her yearning, her quest until the end of her suffering, were typical. She can learn about this era from her experience. \\n[Note] In the fight against the right, the famous cartoonist Hua Junwu painted a comic of Puxi Xixiu, published in the People's Daily, entitled 'Juhug the Lute Half Cover', meaning that she wanted to admit that she did not recognize, to expose the undisclosed, the inner world still hung on the corner of the 'Zhangluo Union'. \\nXie Weiming still remembers that the day when the All-China Journalists Association opened the Puxi Xixiu critical meeting in Beijing Daily, he and Hua Junwu came out of the same way. The two people had a long way, and the latter's look was quite angry, asked Xie Weiming to see the editorial on July 1 of the People's Daily? \\nAt present, despite being mixed in the ranks of the revolutionary masses that criticize others, Xie Weiming, who feels so hard to escape, naturally looked at, and an editorial section elaborates on the Party's policy of dealing with right-wing elements. \\nHua Junwu said: like Pu xixiu, the stubborn right-wing elements, I see the policy given in this editorial is too lenient... Says Xie Ziming's heart seems to touch the sword fibrillation! \\nPerhaps this sentence, Hua Junwu has long forgotten, but his memory is still amazing in the Chinese people. \\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached 3】Wang Pu: The Mystery of Puxi (WeChat)\\nAt the same time, I read the book 'I See America' by Japanese journalist Takashi Tachibana and Pu xixiu's daughter Yuan Donglin recalled her mother's book, 'The Life is Infinite.' Reading and reading, confused me for years of Puxi Xixiu mystery gradually got the idea of answer. \\nTakashi Tachibana revealed a long report of Prime Minister Tanaka Cape's bribery in 1974, which led to the removal and jail of Tanaka two months later. At that time, she was a young journalist for 'Arts and Arts Spring' magazine. To date, she has published 40 books. In her book comparing Japanese and American newspapers, I was particularly impressed by a phrase that she said:\\n'People often say: 'Those who have not learned a foreign language will not understand the Japanese language. ' Newspapers, too, do not know foreign newspapers or Japanese newspapers. This is not just the question of who is good and bad, but without comparisons, understanding cannot be accurate.' \\nMay take this sentence as the starting point for parsing Pu xixiu. \\nThe starting point is: the vision of comparison. Analysis of Pu xixiu with China's special historical and humanistic environment. \\nFor many years, the evaluation of Puxi Xixiu has been polarized. An extreme man holding her as a 'journalistic warrior of the good people'. Her press campaign at The New People in the 1940s seemed to indicate that she was well deserved of this title. She has written many news reports revealing those in power, not afraid of power and evil, with a thin and weak woman, with a strong pen in her hands. Her eldest sister, Pu Jiexu, gave her an assessment of 'integrity and courage' 28 years after her death. This evaluation is also recognized by some people, such as Fei Xiaotong until later, saying: 'After more than a decade of interaction, I see a woman who is faithful, good, courageous and honest.' \\nBut how did she connect her overnight 1957 to the words 'integrity, loyalty and goodness' of her revelation and criticism of her cohabiting boyfriend Rolongi? Zhang Yee, the daughter of the Great Right Zhang Bojun, and in his memories of Lorongki's article 'A mountain has this body', said the most sad person in the anti-right movement: 'There is only one, that is, Pu xixiu... Lorongki repeatedly and again mentions Pu xixiu, sentimental expression, tone is also sentimental: 'You know, Pu xixiu for his own life, do not want me to die! The words of the bed are also used as political discourse, get to the assembly to expose... fatal! '' \\nPu xixiu was lenient by exposing Lorongji's merit. Although he also became the right, he kept the position of CPPCC member. At the Conference, she said with great gratitude that it was the party and alliance that led her to climb out of the right-wing mud pit and saw the socialist door open. She did not seem to be overstated by some scholars who studied Chinese intellectuals in the 1990s as 'no good'. \\nHowever, evaluating a person is very complex, not a simple question of good or bad. Takashi Tachibana said comparisons, here may wish to make a comparison between her and Puxi. \\nOn talents and professionalism, Pu xixiu does not lose in Tachibana, she has a good education, poetry and piano paintings, she has never learned news, she leaves her home and engages in news, it is amazing and writes many influential press releases. Speaking of courage, she is not less than Tachibana. She risked her life several times. In 1946, she was beaten to death by KMT batters in the 1946 Shimonoseki incident. In 1948, he was caught in prison by the KMT for writing a press release revealing the authorities, and was also in danger, arguing for reason, even to treat death at home. \\nSo, what did she miss to make her life only a few years of brilliant and eventually become a tragic figure worthy of thought later? I think that what she lacks is, first and foremost, a spirit of independent thinking like Tachibana. \\nInterestingly, Yuan Donglin also wrote thinking in his memories. She said that after Pu xixiu was hit as the right, 'more love reading and thinking about problems, smoke also smoked more. As far as I know, she read through the collection of Mao Zedong, and repeatedly read 'Practice Theory', 'Contradictions' and 'Speech at the Yan'an Literary Symposium' and many articles on war and peace. In order to lay the foundation for writing cultural history, read 'History' and 'Napoleon's Third Coup d'état' (Marx). Fan Wenlan, 'General History of China' and other books, read Darwin's Life and Its Episodes in order to understand the research methods. \\nObviously, as an intellectualist, Pu xixiu was not unaware of the need to think, she did not have no reflection on her behavior in 1957. At the very least, she also needs to find out the rationale for her actions. She also studied and thought too. The problem is that the same term has different meanings due to different cultural backgrounds and historical circumstances. For example, China has a tradition of thinking in the ruling class as a national way of thinking, a dynasty emperor who obeys Confucianism. Doctors are busy writing and interpretations around Confucianism; this emperor's faith in Buddhism, and the doctors follow the pursuit of the interpretation of Buddhism. So while they think too, this thinking is closed, single-line. \\nThe book list above Puxi Xiu is a typical example. We see that her book list, that is, when toward the ruler. And the book she has read repeatedly is what Mao Zedong herself loves to read. In particular, her way of thinking is to follow the ruler's way of thinking. From her thinking, we can see the thinking of most Chinese intellectuals of that era. At the beginning of their thinking, they had an undeniable conclusion; those in power were right, the times were right, I was wrong, I couldn't keep up with the times, so I was thinking about how to cater to those in power and the times. \\nThis kind of thinking is very different from that of Tachibana. When Tachihana found out that Japan's news system was wrong, she went to study the news system in the United States and around the world. She looked at more than 50 newspapers from more than 20 countries. She focused on researching, interviewing and researching the media system in the United States and how it works. In this study, the Japanese news system is both hairy Where the disease is, how to improve, also constantly adjust their focal length, expand their field of view. \\nSo in my opinion, in 1957 the right-wing elements should be divided into three categories of people. The first is the ideal and targeted people like Zhang Bojun, Lorongki, and Zhang Naijie. They really have a set of great plans of rich and powerful powers in their hearts. They made great efforts to help the Communist Party establish a new China, that is, they want to put this great deal of governance into the ideal country in their mind. They are true bourgeois right. Zhang Yihe said in his memoirs, when Zhang Bojun learned that he and Lorongki had entered the Encyclopedia as the bourgeois right in the British Encyclopedia, privately told her daughter: 'The word in the Encyclopedia of the British Encyclopedia, the interpretation of Zhang Luo two as the bourgeois right-wing character Zhang Luo, Rolong The idea is that under the socialist system, democratic politics is required. ── Such a simple content makes Dad excited all night and feels like he has been engaged in a patriotic democracy movement for a lifetime, and it is quite satisfied that he can get such a boil down.' Zhang Yiho went on to say: 'Father and Loronki were remembered by history as an uncorrected right, and I have always been proud of that identity.' They were the real right with only 0.00 percent of the right in 1957. \\nThe second category of people is a true companion and a victim of the movement of the Communist Party. They were beaten to the right for strange reasons, and some people did not understand exactly what this was going on. These people are the majority of the right. Just as in any revolution there is always a large group of unlucky ghosts swallowed by waves. \\nThe third category is the false right-wing true left, and it is indeed wrong to beat them into the right. They used the left to themselves and walked with the Communist Party with one thought. The movement began to respond to the call to help the Communist Party in the middle of the movement unconditionally accept Mao Zedong's tacit doctrine, exposing criticism of colleagues, friends and relatives. The Communist Party has never considered the Democratic Party as its own family, at best, as relatives. A family went wrong, who was the first to be skeptical and hit? The answer is clearly: relatives. So these infrared perimeter still did not avoid being thrown out of the fate. The late movement was also mostly hit right. So they and the memories of their descendants are mostly grievances and faithful: 'I'm not the right! I am loyal to Chairman Mao loves socialism.' Pu xixiu is like this, Ge Pei Qi, even Hu Feng. Both Pu xixiu and Hu Feng's memorial service were stuck on the issue of eulogy. Their descendants and the authorities repeatedly theories were meant to add the words that they loved the Communist Party for Chairman Mao throughout their life, and to put their national flags and party flags on their coffins. \\nYuan Donglin's memories wrote: 'After a few times, memorial service and eulogy are implemented one by one, but the words '... to meet her years' desire to join the party', the relevant parties insisted on deleting the phrase. I understand the pursuit of Niang's life, and I can only express my reservations and obey the decision of the organization.' \\nIf Pu xixiu thought in accordance with the Communist Party's ideas for many years and finally understood one thing, it would be to understand that, no matter how hard to give effect to the Communist Party as an outsiders, it would be useless to give effect to the Communist Party. Only by joining them can they be seen as their own people. [Otherwise, didn't Liu Shaoqi, Peng Dehuai, and Pan Hannian have joined them? Just like being completely dead.--Wuyi three press] so she was hit as the right, the requirement to join the party is more urgent. In her 1962 diary, she wrote:\\n'In the next five years, while studying history and reading, both have a good foundation, I can come up with a cultural history... Sister Shen encouraged me to apply to the party. Today, Comrade Yangtze River makes me feel necessary to do this, I must find a chance to propose it...'\\nUntil she was terminally ill, she was shocked in the Cultural Revolution and was dying, the desire to obtain the approval of the Communist Party remained undead. Before his death, Pu xixiu 'knew himself soon after the world, and had written a letter to Premier Zhou to bid farewell to ask the Party to review her life.' (Xu Cast into Memories)\\nTo think according to the ideology of those in power, even in the face of a cruel reality such as the Cultural Revolution, she can't see this simple fact: now, both inside and outside the party do not work, they are indiscriminately hit. So what is wrong is the system of thought she believes in. I don't know, in the days of her death, when she was dying, seeing her loved ones were doom, dead dead, injured, a son and a daughter were exiled, away from the side, were criticized and expelled from the hospital. From the following description, there should be no:\\n'She instructed Aunt Liu that when she walked to wear the dress worn during the National Day to Tiananmen Square, there was a white silk shirt, a jacket navy blue blouse, white collar turned out, wearing navy blue trousers, and ordered that the dress be flat and hung to the outside for spare. She was in a coma...'\\nSee here, I'm really tearful, but there is an impulse to laugh in my heart. However, when I saw the description below, that tear hanging in the corner of the eye finally flowed down:\\n'In the rescue, the mother woke up and said, Don't worry. She felt uncomfortable with the tube for oxygen. She unplugged the tube. Aunt Liu said in a hurry, 'You are waiting for the winter forest, she will come. ' The mother said, 'She can't come. ' Later, the mother had no reaction, so he went alone and sadly. '\\nPu Jie Xixiu, Fei Xiaotong and others say right, Pu xixiu is a good and upright woman, brave, also smart, and loyal to their ideals. If we only look at her pre-1957 history and interact with her daily people, these adjectives that we usually use to beautify a person, seem to be able to use her. However, these adjectives and her actions in 1957 are not susceptible. That is, her seller is not overpleted. She was a tragic figure, and the tragedy on her was the epitome of many intellectuals of that era. Yuan Donglin's following remarks are thought-provoking:\\n'In old China, she was not afraid of rape and dare to reveal the truth... In the struggle for the democratic revolution, she was so lively and alive. If sacrificed then, she would die fierce.' \\nBut why are these excellent qualities reversed in New China? She succumbed to rape, under pressure and even at the expense of fabricating facts often splashed dirty water on the body of a lover who once lived and died, she whispered and survived, and finally, she died miserably and was scolded after her death. \\nHowever, I still cry for one. \\nI cried her back a heavy burden of tradition and could not put it down. There are both objective and subjective reasons; in addition to the other burdens of Chinese intellectuals of that era, she had a gender burden; and, in addition to her personal weaknesses (such as too vanity and good name), there are both historical and historical reasons. \\nAmerican journalist Haberstein also faced a crisis of faith when he wrote the sensational American book The Best and Best: the system he wanted to criticize was very strong and strong, and the figures he wanted to expose were the elites of the United States of that era, from Kennedy to McNamara. Among the presidential assistant George Bondi, was even more an idol of his college era, however, When he determines that his goals are correct, he goes ahead. What he can do, neither morality nor talent is lost to his Puxiu, why can't he do it? The answer is clear: because he lives in a democratic and liberal system, he will not be guilty of his ideological and rhetoric or even fall into the hell. \\nSo I cried for her, but also for the pain of crying for that generation and our generation of intellectuals, and even later generations of intellectuals! \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 6"}

Why is it called a 'wasp' anti-party group? That's because our eight big print papers were 'wasps' of the Communist Youth League Tianshui Municipal Committee. When the big print was written, I thought about a pen name, in a hurry I blurred out 'with a 'wasp', I think wasps are very powerful, but I didn't think that 'wasp' was toxic. \\nSecond, the photo attached is a photo of me and teacher Li Jinghang. \\n3.

I did not take the exam in that year because the heart was sick and the medical examination was not satisfactory. Later, the school mobilized me to work at the Tianshui Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League. At that time, the age was just 20 years old. \\nSo by the time of 1957, my guts were great, and the so-called newborn calves were not afraid of tiger. What is the reason for that? One is young, one is the family's personal history is more simple, it is more dare to speak. The most important thing is to believe unreservedly in the Party and to Mao (Zedong), and be faithful. When the call to put on, let party members, team members lead, what to say. \\nThe big print of several of us, 'Speak to the Municipal Committee', said the municipal committee secretary quite thoroughly and very sharp. Others do not dare to say, are things that everyone usually dare to be angry and not dare to say. The big print was posted. \\nAccording to: Did you write it alone, or a few people? \\nPu: It was written by a few young people from Tianshui Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, signed 'wasps', and finally knocked us into a 'wasp opposition group'. Why is it called 'wasps'? There is a little story inside. After writing the big print, let everyone sign, everyone is reluctant to sign their own name, because the leaders of the municipal committee often meet, feel embarrassed. Someone said, 'With a pen name, on behalf of all of us.' And I said, 'Use a wasp.' I remember a magazine called Bee, in a hurry, I remember wrong, remember a wasp. Bees turned into wasps. Didn't expect this wasp to have a head? \\nYe: Haha, wasp is still a man. \\nPu: That is, wasps are powerful, there is a head. After the big print newspaper was posted, the municipal committee is opening an expanded meeting. Leaders of both large and small Tianshui city attended. Everyone stood there to watch our big print newspaper, with a great response. At that time, there was such a positive thing that criticized the bureaucratic style of the municipal committee and the special style of cadres. People pass people, legends everywhere. We were also praised at the time, and grass-roots groups were responding positively to our big print. Later, when it came to reverse the right, the leaders of the grass-roots regiment organizations were implicated. \\nAt the time of processing, the nine people who participated in the revelation, seven were classified as the right, and the other two were classified as right-wing speech, which was basically a net run out. Last year, when a director Wang came to interview me, 'I found the wasp opposition group for half a day, and there was no material in the file. You say weird?' \\nAccording to: Was your role a 'beehead'? \\nPu: No, I'm not. I'm a little bee, followed by the dry. Hu Zhizhong, secretary of the Communist Party Committee at that time, is now in his 80s, is still alive. We were designated as 'wasp opposition group' beekeepers. We are all bees, and are all a bunch of bees. This is a big thing, and a comic was published in the China Youth Daily. That is, our secretary Hu, who is beekeepers, released a group of barbed bees and flutted towards the red sun, meaning that he has flutted towards Mao and the Party Central Committee. \\nAccording to: Is it a caricature drawn for your event? \\nPU: It was a sensation at that time. It was on the China Youth Daily. Maybe it was the fall of 1957. There was an article in the Gansu Daily, in October 1957. A correspondent reported that a comic was allotted, saying that the Tianshui Municipal League Committee was an assistant to the Party, how about it. This was what I found out later, and I kept the newspapers. It was October 1957. \\nAt that time, the first backbone was Wang Shiqi. He was the chairman of the provincial school federation and the minister of the student department of the county committee. He was sent to the sandwich ditch and died in the gutter. I was the second backbone, beaten to the far right and sent to the gutter. At that time, the extreme right was not declared, saying that the main backbone of the 'wasp opposition group' was the two of us. Then there's another one called Zhang Jichang, who later became a principal in primary school. He became the principal of his life, and another Wang Wenbin, who was Minister of Political Affairs of the League Committee. Wang Wenbin, I heard that I had passed away and died in Qingshui. There are some people below, a woman named Yelan, Minister of the Juvenile Department, specializing in the Young Pioneers. A total is to wear a few hats, 9 people. The most serious thing to deal with is that I and the Pharaoh were sent to the sandwich ditch.\\nI went to the month of May 8, 1958, and came back on December 21, 1960. \\nYe: Did you become home? \\nPu: No, no, I was 22 years old when I went and was 24 years old when I came back. You can't find the object when you come back. Become an unaudible stinky shit. \\nE: Before you go, there are no lovers? \\nPu: Yes, there, there. \\nBy: Are there any affected? \\nPu: Our relationship is pretty good. She died last year, called Tang Shujuan. She is the school flower of our first school (Tianshui city middle school), hahaha. I went to the municipal committee to participate in the work, (friend said: Mr. Pu Yiye was very handsome when he was young, able to write good paintings, can be active.), We play table tennis together, show together, relationship is OK. She often came to me to chat and play. But at the beginning of the anti-right, I gave her a note, saying, 'We stop quickly, you don't dare to find me again.' I was afraid to implicate her, and people were young. \\nBy: How old was Tang Shujuan? \\nPu: Gao San, that is 18 years old. Little girl, very simple. \\nI: Is she willing to break up with you? \\nPu: I estimate that form, open a critical meeting, criticize a few days later, nothing will be done. I can't think of such serious consequences, I don't know. Criticized me at that time, I had something on the National Day, riding my bike to the east bridge, and nobody on the way took care of me, all escaped. I met Tang Shujuan, she stood under the tree. I bowed and she shouted me: 'One leaf, one leaf.' I did not gnaw, speeding up and running on the car. I never met again, that was the last time. \\nAfter her admission to college, she was assigned to Urumqi after she graduated from the Institute of Nationalities, and she never had any contact, because identity and status were very different, one heavenly, one underground. I became Lai toad, no hope anymore. \\nEY: Has her mother objected to your interaction? \\nPu: Her mother began to support, look at my good character, work at the municipal committee was also very good, she said to me: 'My girl is small, still studying miles, how to drill together?' Ha, haha. I haven't met again since then. \\nYe: Is it your first love? \\nPu: Yes, I went to the regiment municipal committee, engaged in activities very active, often organized table tennis, performing performances, I met Tang Shujuan. I had that meaning, I wrote a letter to her, and it was very simple, like the one that the correspondents took up, anyway, that meant that. At that time, there were quite many people pursuing Tang Shujuan. That (courtship), had a lot of faith, and officers at the school, Xinduo did not look at it. \\nI: How can you chase her as a girlfriend? \\nPu: After the letter was written, I did not expect to reply, write it anyway, I wish. As a result, a reply was received from the Corps correspondent. Her reply was also very simple, saying that I am also studying and not making friends with anyone. You're so proud of me when I look at it? Just up gas. As a result, after two nights, I stayed in the office, Tang Shujuan and a girl came. This girl later was XX's wife, accompanied by Tang Shujuan and came to my regiment office. It was the evening, and I was very happy, some of them. Ha, haha, I remember the dress she wore at that time. She said to play table tennis, and we played a few boards in the room. Later she said to borrow books. I'm a person from the Propaganda Department. She picked a few books, 'Quiet Don River' or something, I'm afraid it could not understand. Come to my dorm again and play chess with me. She still loved to do poetry, let me see what she wrote... at that time, the two people were very different. \\nThis thing, you see, is that there is no anti-right, nor will it succeed. Because I have already worked at the Communist Party Committee, it is not possible to go to college again. I have congenital heart disease, not treated well. You said, she went to college. It was simply impossible for her people to go to the north of the South China Sea. She was not also divided into Xinjiang in the end. \\nAccording to: This first love, a sense of affection, is beautiful, we now just recall. \\nPu: Yes, the first love was knocked off against the right. After I came back from the sandwich groove, I found the object 6, all failed. After some of the meeting, you can see this guy, but also wear glasses, like an intellectuals. I was wearing glasses at that time. When people asked me, I honestly said, 'I made a mistake.' People asked: 'What mistake did you make?' I said, 'Right.' Some people just walked away as soon as they listened, they didn't look at me, and they were over. At that time, an old comrade in the work unit, very enthusiastic, introduced me to his relatives, his niece, working in the canteen, was not highly educated and worked in the northern canteen. After the meeting, the girl's mother said: 'You introduce my girl to the object, surname can do anything, as long as it is not the right.' But I'm a right. Ha, hahaha, it's over. Hahaha. I became a difficult household. \\nAccording to: Please tell you about the situation where you go to the edge groove. \\nPu: I was on May 8, 1958 to go, a total of two years and 8 months. So many people died, why didn't I die in the gutter? You must want to ask, I'll tell you. \\nBecause at that time, I was young but weak. Correctional cadres knew that I had congenital heart disease. I was a person who could not work hard. I would not force me to do a tired job. One more, I'm short, small amount of rice. Give a little, you can eat almost. One more, my mother at home often gave me the food they saved from my home. So even if the life was not sent off, it was returned alive. \\nI: What does Mom send you something? \\nPu: dried, dried slices, sometimes fried cooked noodles, fried noodles, sometimes also sent 1 pounds of desserts. I don't even know, in 1960, when people starved to death, dim sum was simply not available. Finally, from the sandwich gou farm to Gaotai Mingshui River Farm, was when a large number of dead people, my mother ran from Tianshui to Gaotai specifically went to see me once. My mother was under heavy snow, and my mother was under 40 years old, carrying a box filled with food to see me. Get off the train, I don't know how to come. When I met my mother, my mother became snowman, full of snow, and snow on the eyelashes on the eyebrows. Just freeze it like that. My mother was afraid I was starving to death. That was the most critical time, to live and live was to see if there was that bite. That box came to the central working group, moved me to Xinhua Farm, and my life began to improve. \\nAccording to: Do you have something to send, does anyone steal your stuff to eat? \\nPu: Oops! Steal great, my stuff he does not steal. \\nBy: How do you save it? \\nPu: My mother brought me the sheepskin case, I was sleeping on the pillow, when my pillow, hard was a hard point, but let me rest assured. \\nI: What about you asleep? \\nPu: asleep is asleep, you open my box I can know, and then my box is locked, two can not open. \\nI: What do you give to anyone else? \\nPu: To Li, if I don't give it to others, people have something to eat or eat for me. I live next door to a small Shanghai, his home sent Gui Yuan, not guiyuan meat, is Gui Yuan made pills, no longer anything. He's going to use this pill for my pill, because that pill can't understand that hungry. I thought, said yes. He gave me a couple of Katsuran balls, and I gave him half a bit to make this business. I ate the Katsuran ball, the strength is quite large, the head is not fainted, the body also has strength, and people can sit up. \\nNext door to my shop is the director of the Quinta County Attorney's Office, and the family came to see him bring a bottle of lard, and he said, 'You mouth open!' I asked, 'What do I do?' He said, 'You will open it!' My eyes were hungry, my mouth was open, a spoon of lard was fed into my mouth, that yummy, good fragrant, I couldn't say it. \\nI owe them, and when my mother came, gave him a little bit of my stuff. This is little Shanghai, and this dean, sleeping on one of my left, one right, is my 'neighbor next door.' \\nAccording to: When you go to work, what do you eat? Not afraid of stealing? \\nPu: At that time lived in the nest, people could not move, the bowel was paved, no longer work, all lay all day, not like a person. \\nWhen working in the past, the home sent things, crimped under the quilt, sleep on it at night and insured. Five people a small house, came out to work and locked the door, people went out of work, and there were no people in the house, there was nothing to steal. The Li Jinghang (Tianshui No. 1 middle school teacher, Christian, was beaten into the right, sent to the sandwich, written 'The Journey of Grace', 90 years old.), , That is what you've seen, I said, how did Teacher Li take an iron lift as a flat burden, carrying a wooden box, and what do you do with a box on his back? Where do you go back to where to do? He's a carpenter who made his own boxes. When I asked, he said he was stolen. What is the reason for that? He was in the carpentry group, the door was open, and he was stole clean when he worked without looking at it. \\nI: Stole everything he eats? \\nPu: All, all were stolen, and everything eaten was stolen. He cried like a dead mother. I said, 'What's the matter?' He said things had been stolen and hungry to sleep. He knew that it had been stolen by carpentry groups, did not capture people, had no evidence and no means. After teacher Li went, his performance was very naive, and couldn't sleep hungry at night, went to the office to look for Officer Zhao, and shouted at the door: 'Report.' Director Zhao asked: 'Three more midnight, what happened?' Teacher Li said: 'I cannot sleep hungry.' Officer Zhao said: 'Go, call the kitchen to give you half a!' As a result, Teacher Li ate half a plus of the mess. The news spread out. The next day, in front of the window where Officer Zhao sleeps, people were full of people, like waiting for people to give lost food fish. They all need half a mile, and will not give. \\nE: You say the death of someone you know. \\nPu: 'Little Shanghai' next to me is dead. Let me see, he shouted from morning to night before he died, 'Mama-! Mama-! Mom-yeah!' Cry his mother, Shanghai is about my age, that is 20 years old. And I said, 'You endure, your mother is in Shanghai, and can't hear your call. What is your name?' He still cried, still called, the voice was small, cried very sad. That night, before going to bed, he was quiet. Before going to bed, he said, 'Puko, I went to sleep, maybe, I could see my mother...' The next day, the morning 'Little Shanghai' was still not heard, I shake, did not react, man's head facing inside the wall, feet in the aisle, and people died in the middle of the night. Two people came, quilt roll, foot grab, and dragged out. My side was empty and 'Little Shanghai' was dead, and I could sleep more wide. \\nThe director of the Jinta County Public Prosecutor's Office is still alive, probably still in miles. At first, there were more than 40 people living in the nest, crowded closely, just like a honeycomb. After a few days, less than 10 people left. \\nAccording to: More than 30 people are _____ dead? \\nPu: All dead. \\nAccording to: What is the name of this 'Little Shanghai'? \\nPu: I don't know very much, I know his last name, and I call him little. \\nE: Where did he go from? \\nPu: I can't remember. \\nEY: And those people died by your side? \\nPu: There is a professor, surnamed Pei, whose name cannot be said. Lanzhou came from Lanzhou, after sleeping at night, can't sleep, and hungry, and bad mood, I need to find someone to speak. He shouted, 'Little Pu, you just read the newspaper, several words were wrong.' I didn't believe it. I said, 'No, I can still read the wrong words in the newspaper.' 'You listen carefully, I say to you.' He said one by one, I was wrong with a few words. I was interested, I wanted to go dark and use this time to learn something. Professor Pei is very clear and well-founded about the history of China and abroad in the past. What 'say literal word', a word has several readings, how to use it in what place, speaks very well, is what I don't know. Later, he died of starvation and was 50 years old. Under that condition, his personal hygiene was still quite good and clean. Don't look at the professor, stitching is still well done, sewing repair. One day to night smoked a dry smoke pot, this is the one I remember starving. \\nAnd one more is, you see, there's a king who starves to death. Think about, less than 3 sides a day, 3 sides boil the paste, drink some in the morning, drink a little at night, plus the cold weather, minus 20 degrees of Gobi beach, no stove no kang. And the key is people desperate, when can they go back? Already desperate, can you go back? That is, to abolish re-education through labor. What should I do to leave me here? So hard place, wind sand so big? What about wives and children without seeing a place where people are not ghosts? Everyone is worried. \\nMy concerns are not too big, my father works on the railway, my mom works on the street, not married, no worries. This Pharaoh, a wife in his family, five dolls did not eat at that time. \\nBy: Did you give you a little salary, or living expenses? \\nPu: According to the State Council, to the right wing 18 yuan a month, to people who go to the gutter alone 18 yuan in January. \\nAccording to: Is there any money for your home? \\nPu: That doesn't matter. These 18 bucks, in addition to food, clothing, basket-colored padded jackets, gown, probably a person can still have a few bucks left, and will be given to individuals. There are 6 blocks, 4 blocks, 3 blocks, 3 levels. There was also a small shop that could sell fruit sugar, chili noodles, soy sauce paste. In the end there is nothing, you can only buy an ink, and kerosene in the lamp kerosene, lamp twist. That is, these three or four yuan, some people still have to save and send them to their families, to their wives and children, and breadwinners. \\nThis teacher Wang, named Wang Jingquan, is a teacher of the Third Middle School. His woman with three sons, two women, a total of five children, would have no way to pick some wild vegetables to eat wild vegetables, sell wild vegetables, give people laundry clothes, and no one wants to go to the right family to find work at all. An old little doll so big, almost starved to death, in that case, supply a little oil a little noodles, also fried some oil cake, steamed, sent to her husband. This woman is not simple. It's still here, and I've come to see me last year. \\nIn this anti-right time, he only said one sentence. Before liberation, he was a law department of Peking University and was a judge at the Gansu Provincial Court. He did not want to speak because his history was not clear, but not to speak. He was warned by the leader, not to speak. He said one sentence: 'It is suggested that our rule of law be better.' This sentence will not be necessary. People will be the proletarian dictatorship, you speak of the rule of law. \\nAccording to: He said this way, people understand that the rule of law is not sound. \\nPu: Yes, right, haha, this is what people analyze. You say that sound, not sound, you need to be sound. He was sent to the sandwich 'to improve the rule of law'. \\nBy: How old was he? \\nPu: that is, 46 and 7 years old, I have the original letter written by Mr. Wang to his house. I have it, to show you. (Mr. Pu went to find a letter), You see, if he wrote a letter at the beginning, or he said that our situation was great, how about the three red flags, how were the three red flags fluttered, and gave good news to the party, how was my transformation successful. Finally, say what I want to eat, please send it a little, not dare to say starving. They are not allowed to say to the outside world that they can't eat enough. Letters are all to let cadres check before they can be sent out. \\nAccording to: sandwich gutter still gong drum hustle red flag I look at this letter. \\nA full transcription of the postcard from Wang Jingquan to his wife Cao Youyu: (Maybe Wang Jingquan wants home letter to be sent after a review by correctional cadres, it is better to write a postcard, feel free to let people check, as long as you can send it out.), \\nFriends:\\nHappy New Year! \\nOpen the door, full of red, moon red. I was still struggling with a sick body, and came to an open door. In January 1 and two days, two days, participate in the fattening 700,000 pounds of labor, completed ahead of time, and gave good news to the leaders. How exciting is our 60 years to beat and play firecrackers! I don't know what about you guys? Did you receive the letter from December last year? I have not received your letter for a long time, I miss it very much. Now the New Year has passed, the Chinese New Year is coming, in addition to wishing you a happy Spring Festival! I wish you and your children the work situation, learning situation, health situation. I look forward to your letter and let me know. \\nI now have a swollen face, swollen feet, the more often, become weak, a little bit can't resist the frequent cold wind here. I hope that under your economic conditions permit, give me a leather vest, more in need of grease food supplements. The lard you bought during the Spring Festival, or the fried oil and fruit, sent me better. Glucose and vitamins are too expensive to send. \\nWrite a good wish, you are healthy with the children, and by the way ask the two uncles of the camp and Yanmin children well. \\nSpring book in sick break 1960.1.18. \\nYe: Has this teacher Wang Jingquan survived? \\nPu: No, starve in the gutter. Her wife went to find the grave, so much, simply could not be found. After her return, she was unwilling to write to the Farm Department of the Sandwich Ditch and wanted to relocate Wang Jingquan's grave back. The factory department still sent her a letter back and asked her to find her own. This is a reply she has saved for more than 50 years. Look, this is the original. \\nComrade Ge Youyu:\\nYour husband Wang Jingquan's tomb site, through the west of the farm part of the jiangbiangou farm to the shakou, from the tomb, tombstone number 25 tomb. We have original brick monuments on the tomb and buried with names painted with stones. But now due to the sandwich groove farm has been withdrawn, the time is also a long time, tombstone is not likely to be weavened. Our opinion is whether it is feasible for long time, long distances, not to move. If you want to move, that's okay too. The detailed address of the tomb is to the jiangbiangou farm, turn left to Xintian Road, not far away. \\nCizhi\\nSalute! \\nLocal Xiaheqing Farm, Gansu Province, August 24, 1963\\n(Pu Yiye Note: After the withdrawal of the farm, the file data is transferred to the Xiahe Qing Farm)\\nAccording to: in the sandwich ditch, when hungry, have you looking for something to eat? \\nPu: When my stomach is hungry, I don't find something to eat. Because I have a small amount of rice, I can basically eat. Another one, I have a problem, I don't like wild vegetables to eat. Some people find some wild vegetables, use a cylinder, get the stoves, probably cooked and eaten. \\nI'm not particularly hungry, you see, hungry is not hungry. You can't imagine, I'm hungry and go no way. \\nI'm relatively thin, the amount of rice is small, the amount of activity is small, has always been able to maintain. At the end of the day, my mother brought a box of things at home and saved my life. Some puzzar-shaped Han, simply hungry crazy, grab anything to eat. \\nYe: Does anyone grab your stuff to eat? \\nPu: No, no, you see, all cadres and intellectuals, love face. It is common to steal it, and eat as long as you can. So 5 people's house that lock is very tight, there is no lock in the nest, digging a cave hole, hanging a blanket, blanket will go in. And he who slept and fell asleep, and they fell asleep, and they could not sit up. For those who died at that time, there were dozens and hundreds of dead miles a day. \\nBy: When is the most dead? \\nPu: December 1960. At that time, when the central rescue of human lives came, and I was saved. \\nMy views are not the same as teacher Li. First, the edge groove is not terrible. \\nAccording to: Not terrible?! \\nPu: Not terrible. Correctional cadres are not all so terrible. The one who disciplines me is good for me. Teacher Li is profoundly abhorrent to his cadres, each with various perspectives. Also, Director Liu Factory, an industrial and agricultural cadre, is the captain of a large team under Liu Zhidan. That person has no culture, but people are very good, the speech is also very realistic. If anyone tied up a rope, plant director Liu would not say his good words either. Now, I think back and forth, as if I read a novel, there are episodes with stories. \\nBy: How many deaths have been seen in your own eyes? \\nPu: I saw the man of the nest of the land in which I dwelt. Live far away, the name is not up. Why, after Gaotai Mingshui River, people who live to disrupt, not the original way, many people don't know. \\nThe film 'Edge Ditch' was seriously distorted. Wang Bing also came to interview me, too young. You think the nest is that narrow aisle, wide miles on the movie, and a table, where is it? And bowls and chopsticks, where are bowls and chopsticks? It doesn't exist at all. Still have a heater, where to come from the heater? I looked ridiculous. \\nAccording to: that is, there is no heating pot? \\nPu: no, no bowl for dinner, no chopsticks. \\nAccording to: do not bowl, chopsticks, take what to eat? \\nPu: with a pot, a person to scoop a spoon, then a breath was drunk, and fell down. Drinking dilute in the morning, night, lethargy and sleepy miles. This is one. \\nI think it's funny to think of living until now, from the right to the present. You want to put me dead, but some people are still alive. Our municipal committee secretary and organization minister were killed one or two net. Zhang Jiantug was a director, and said to me, 'Lao Po, how do you blame those people?' I said, 'Don't blame who those people blame?' At that time those people were still alive, he said, 'The keys are all hurt by hair.' Ha, hahaha. I said, 'You have not led properly now, and you are daring to speak.' \\nIt felt very nervous at that time, as if it had gone no way, and would die at all times. Now think about it, all the hardships and hardships come. \\nAccording to: I want to ask you a question, so many people die in the gutter is what you see. When I asked you, you said the gutter is not terrible, I don't understand well. What do you think about the problem? \\nPu: I always feel like watching a novel, I used to love novels, I was a bystander. Some people are dying, they call; 'Come to people... come.' I'm not afraid to sleep with the dead, just that thing. \\nE: Do you see the people next to yo"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "u die, are there any sorrows? Cry? \\nPu: It was also numb, the day before talking to me, the next day people had already hard help. In the middle of the night is the peak of the dead, in the middle of the night, the most death, the most powerful time, people's heart beats slowly, it will not work. I was asleep, and I heard people call me miles, my eyes open, and a march was held on top of my head. That is, Officer Zhao, he said, 'Open your mouth!' I opened my mouth, and he gave me a spoon of brown sugar water, which was a life-saving measure. One day, I had a great headache, cried in the middle of the night. Officer Zhao brought a long flashlight to see my eyes, all astigmatized, put on the carriage, sent to the field every night, stayed in the hospital for two days, was a heavy cold, and I was saved. Therefore, some people now curse officer Zhao, but also want to be realistic. To his point of view, whoever wants to manage, that is the work of people. \\nThose cadres, bad guys are miles, there are so few. General can also. \\nAccording to: To what extent are you talking about bad guys? \\nPu: Bundles, hangings, buckles, steals the watch of the dead. Some of the right are overseas Chinese, some wearing famous watches, some dollars, people are dead, they have all been taken away by them. There is also a cadre, wearing several tables on their arms, and the legacy of the dead is their own, not to the families of the dead. \\nOur city also has a gutter back to the right, 97 years old this year, and it is no longer a word. Called Zhang Kaili, his woman is a very famous pediatrician. I recently went to see it. I couldn't talk. It's laughing all day until night, and the brain is already Alzheimer. \\nAccording to: After removing your right hat, there are no official documents, what compensation? \\nPu: When I came back, I was quite lucky. Xiong Simao, director of the Civil Affairs Bureau. The person thought very well, temporarily arranged me to the shelter station, which is to check the shelter station by the outflows. We are halfway people, stop to Shaanxi run, don't let go out. Why the host? Is the man running out, what to do? Who kind of miles? What to eat next year? I do the greatest benefit of this job and can eat. For as much food as much food, for example, 50 people were accommodated at night, 40 people ran the next morning, and three were left when working in the afternoon. So there was no way to control the food, so we gave three or four of our staff to eat beauty. Eat the time photo face swollen (fat), so round. \\nAccording to: Who are you hosting? \\nPu: All of us in Gansu run to you Shaanxi, to the railway station, to the cave, to the street, and hotels, these four places receive people. Get seven or eight people to help us, all are outflows, good birth, good composition, strong, obedient. After taking those fugitives, they were sent to their places of origin. My identity is a cadre. The webmaster of the reception station is an old cadre who has participated in the Yan'an rectification movement, and there is also an armed police cadre. I am responsible for registration, review, as a custodian. The following people are also willing to work for us, because they can eat a full stomach. When dark, take people out to receive people, after coming to register, buy tickets, and then forcibly send home. They didn't want to go back, and they ran away half the way. \\nWe are responsible for sending people to North Road, there are transfer stations in the north to all counties. \\nBy: How many people can be accommodated in a day? \\nPu: Six or seventy people. Doing that person to diligent a little faster, 6 o'clock, dark, going to check the hotel, some are staying in the hotel. Waiting room overnight, after 12 o'clock to find. These are not bad guys, they are peasants forced by life, and some come out to do business. Of these, one or two percent of them are flowing. These people are dangerous, robbed, stealing, doing anything. So those who went to shelter were equipped with pistols and guns. It is dangerous for these people to mingle in the peasant artesian flow, and the results are examined and checked, and this part of the people is handed over to the public security side. Usually farmers buy tickets, give three days of dry food sent back. \\nAccording to: I personally was very interested in the desertion, shelter and deportation of Gansu people at that time. You will talk more about it. \\nPu: At that time, many women went to Shaanxi. If you go to Shaanxi to bring people back, you can often kill you. People's wife, for a couple of years, you go to take, of course, not. \\nI was lucky and brought a man. Haha, ha, I remember Luogu Village, Xingping County, Shaanxi Province. \\nAccording to: Who did you take it with? \\nPu: I went as a cadre of the Civil Affairs Bureau. The husband of his family was a soldier, in Xinjiang. I and the captain, the captain and I sold this woman to Shaanxi in the name of the subject of the introduction. We seize the captain's lesson: 'You bring people to see them back, or you will be sentenced.' Because this is military marriage, active military personnel, and the Civil Affairs Bureau attach great importance. The captain is young, that is, 24 and 5 years old. \\n'How did this get miles?' I was worried, I went to the whole Zhuang Zi people against, the iron lift up to beat you half to death. What are the reasons why we're very lucky? Three of us got off at Luogu Village, Xingping County, and saw four or five women with a flower towel on their heads. Shaanxi women didn't like to put their handkerchief on their heads, called Papa. We just got off the car, the captain's eyes, suddenly went up a hug, hugged and shouted: 'Beautiful, beautiful, do you recognize me?' Shu Meixin soft, hesitant, drove away. I said to the captain, 'What about this? Are we going back?' In a hurry to atonement, the captain caught up to Xiumei and said: 'Let's go back, now Gansu is not starving.' Xiumei said: 'I don't return, now I save a little food stamps and a little cotton in Shaanxi, and I have to tell people individually miles. I can't go without saying a word. I go like this, I'm sorry. Conscience can't go.' I think this beauty is a good person, I can't go back out. What can I do? She said, 'You are assured.' \\nAs a result, she went smoothly, and packed her clothes, and the man was simply, he said, 'You are cadres also come, and his man is not easy to become soldiers in Xinjiang, then keep up with you and go back.' He may also be afraid that this is a military marriage, and he will be sentenced for failure to do so. Just put it back. I said to the captain, 'You get something to eat.' I said, 'How do you eat this rice?' As a result, a radish was pulled behind the house, rubbed the earth some, and we were eating down. Anyway, people were brought back, the task was completed. As a result, the man in Zhuang was very generous, and said to Xiumei, 'You go, just have a good day to go.' Bring the show beauty comforted a bit. If you encounter a little fierce, simply people will not take away. \\nAccording to: Do you have a doll? \\nPu: No dolls. \\nAccording to: Does the show beauty cry? Did the husband cry? \\nPu: No, no. Shumei is still very happy. The man did not meet in the end. We were waiting in the village captain's home, and the show was coming. The man gave some cotton, saying that Gansu is still difficult to get it back for use. The family is okay. Some people went to Shaanxi leaders, who were beaten to bloodshed, and were killed. Do not come back at all. This is 62 years. The situation in Gansu is slightly better. \\nAccording to: Have you ever been to Shaanxi again? \\nPu: I went once and no longer. I was a little older and I was beaten up and maimed. You ran to Shaanxi when you were hungry, and your stomach was full, came to lead people, didn't you beat you to death? The whole village came to hit people. \\nZhang Desheng, secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee, and Zhang Zhongliang, secretary of the Gansu Provincial Party Party Party Party Party Party, Zhang Zhongliang is a Shaanxi, and Zhang Desheng scolded: 'You see you made that mess, how many women I have given you down to feed you down. You don't have my love yet? Or I have broken you all, and your sins are greater.' The sin that Zhang Zhongliang committed in Gansu is very large. The right wing of the gutter is his 'credit', and he can't run anywhere. \\nI worked for a few years, and I went to the United Front Department, Minister Yan of the United Front Department, and asked me to talk to me, and I said, 'What matter.' People say, 'Study to wipe your hat.' I said, 'This is good.' The hat was taken, the official salary. Previously, there were 30 pieces of living expenses per month, and after it was set 49 units a month, cadre administration level 24. Since then, there had been little burden, and until January 1979, the right-wing elements made a mistake and corrected it. After the correction, I replied to the political honor. My party question has not been answered. What would you like? I can't find my case. \\nAccording to: Is there a correction for your 'Wasps Group'? \\nPu: 'Wasp Group' as a grievance, completely knocked down. They said, 'No one in this file classifies you as an anti-party group, which is propaganda in the newspapers.' This is the shirking of responsibility. \\nI finished at the shelter, went to the Cultural and Education Bureau, and then to the Health Bureau, and later to the Cultural Revolution, I had no disaster. There are two factions. Neither of my parties participated. What would you like? People discarded me, so I still took up the cheap. Later, I went to the dry school for three years to work, and came out to a commune, and later went to the Industrial and Commerce Bureau... and then retired, I thought, my right wing was not bad, I really made an opinion at that time. \\nBased on the experiences of each of me, I wrote this 'Exile Edge Ditch'. I have not yet had the opportunity to publish it, I don't know when? No one dares to give. \\nAccording to: These are all very precious historical materials, you are saved, will be published. \\nThank you. \\nThank you to Ms. L who accompanied me in Tianshui, thank Mr. Pu Yiye, who is in bad health and almost lost his ears. \\n[Attachment] Tianshui Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC): 'A Single Line of Material of Pu Yiye'\\nPu Yiye, (male, 21 years old, Communist Youth League member, Tianshui city people, family composition small owners renters, high school education level, 1955 to participate in work. (The current secretary of the Municipal Committee.), Since joining the work, the Pu has been proud of complacency and no one's eyes. The purpose of his participation is to restore health at work, remedial homework, and continue to study. For two years, the goal has not been achieved and is unhappy with the party. After the whole start, together with Wang Wenbin and others everywhere to gather opinions on the leadership of the municipal committee, the Communist Party Committee 'to add a word to the municipal committee' poisons, the Pu played a leading role in attacking the party. \\nIn the mid stage, is the Standing Committee of the Mission, working Diao Erlangdang. Secretary Liu has pride of complacency and subjective work. If the report of Chairman Mao is being transmitted by Sun Xingzhong (vice-minister), he said in a mess. Some people made comments, Secretary Liu all explained in the above, saying that the dogmist opinion is the taste of intellectuals. \\nTo convene a meeting of young producers, he was not willing to hold, did not support the rural aquaculture team. He asked others to look at the problem, but he had all physical views. \\nSecretary Yang with rogue habit, indiscriminately cursing people. There is a rogue style, grace, do not learn nothing. Meetings do not speak and report very poor quality. It is recommended to replace incompetent, or send party schools to study. \\nPersonnel arrangements cannot be intended from long-term interests, but only for the current needs, suggest what kind of person placement cadres can become in the future. \\nThe subsidy of the municipal committee, the amount of money is proportional to the size of the official. This is a disguised embezzlement and calls for withdrawal of the subsidy. \\nCity women's federation has the old social family style, talk is all over please, and beautiful. The work of the League Committee failed to educate young people in the spirit of communism and appeared passive. Only turn with the materials of the Municipal Committee, it can be undiligent. The organization of the regiment may become the possibility of the masses, which is a crisis facing the regiment organization. The leadership of the League Committee will obey the leadership, blindly retain a certain self-esteem to separate. \\nMission site construction committee made comments, silent and did not want to correct the shortcomings. The site works committee of the regiment drilled on two sides, (the provincial committee, the land committee), summed up the views and reported to the provincial committee and the land committee, and took effective measures to abolish the incorporation of municipal committees at all levels. \\nThe view given to the big print newspaper of the municipal committee should also become a rain spot, of course, there are shortcomings, but can not conceal the good aspects. I think this is the party, and I think it's just embellished the landscape. Like a democrat, the ratio of eight to two is still quite. (The idea is: 80 percent of the opinions are correct and 20% incorrect), because the opinion is made from helping the party improve its leadership style, although the opinion is sharp and some words are incorrect, this is different from the right-wing elements. It is basically correct, which should account for eight. In addition, we are all young people and see that the problem is one-sided. Also wearing some people's emotions, others write articles like to use some gorgeous and unique words, a shining amazing. \\nAt present, the whole country is in the stage of big magnification, some of the poisonous grass released by our organs, but basically correct. The big word has reported a certain bad influence. The Communist Youth League gives advice to the Party, which also reflects the role of the Party's assistant. Where is the municipal committee going? It cannot simply be said to go to socialism. In the crisis, the Municipal Committee showed that the party and socialism had a strong persuasive power to correct the shortcomings and overcome the 'three hazards'. Temporary factors are seen as permanent factors, and localized as whole. Secretary Yang's hooligan habit issue should first be separated from rogue and rogue habits. There are many properties of rogue, rogue habit is just a property of rogue. Yang is not a hooligan, but a hooligan habit. It cannot be said that a group of rogue led the municipal committee, but Secretary Yang and other officials with rogue habits led the municipal committee. Regarding the revocation of the Mission, the land and the work committee is only a kind of sentiment, and not the stereotyping of each person, this proposal is positive in the sense. Some people suggest that bias emotions are flourishing, this is a stick to death, and to lead the step down, this is also inappropriate to say. \\nTianshui Municipal Committee of the Communist Party Committee of China (CPC), Tianshui Municipal Committee, 1957 (Annex): 'Report to the Leading Group of City Hat Picking-On Correcting the Case of Wasp Opposition Group' (omitted)\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 15"}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】Yi Name: 'Jiading NLD Xian Mr. Pu Yong' (CPC Jiading District Committee United Front Department 'United Front Channel' 2016.8.8)\\nPuyong and Puxi Xixiu are both Jiading people, and belong to the same family, the two people are one year old, but by age Puyong is Pu-Xixiu's uncle's grandfather, several articles written as uncle wrong. In early 1966, I just dropped from Yan Chai Hospital to Jiading Nanxiang Hospital soon, I heard that there was an old teacher in Nanxiang middle school and calligrapher Pu yong. He was originally the principal of Jiading Kai Liang School and was the principal of Jiading Simple Normal School. After being classified as the right in 1958, demoted to Nanxiang. I wanted to visit him out of a love of calligraphy and respect for the teacher, but soon I rolled up an unprecedented storm. In the early morning of the North Wind whistling, in the Democratic Street of Nanxiang, a weak old man sweeping the ground. He curly curly and that big broom was almost high. Goat Hu had water droplets and frozen sores broke out. My colleague told me that this old man was Pu-swim. At that time, he could only take the special number to write on the cold earth. \\nAfter the fall of four people, an ice melting early spring, received a freshman Puyung came to the hospital. He suffers from severe chronic bronchitis, low heat rush, and hernia. I consulted with several colleagues and decided to let him be hospitalized for nursing care. At that time, he lived in a broken bungalow with less than 10 square square corner of Nanxiang Middle School campus, two stools supporting three feet wide bamboo bed, there were also a lot of books on it. The corner was hoe iron and pungent pesticides, and young people who lived in such places for a long time would also be sick. Puolao's condition has improved after a period of treatment in the hospital. During this period, I had a lot of contact and understanding with him. In the early years he studied at the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts founded by Liu Haisu, and Zhao Dan and my uncle Liu Yifei were classmates. He studied sculpture, Zhao Danxue painting, and my uncle studied oil painting. He was actively involved in the anti-Japanese rescue student movement during the War of Resistance against Japan and was abducted by Japanese agents. After the victory of the resistance, he went back to Jiading for education, hosted Kai Leung School from kindergarten to secondary school. As the principal he also taught many courses, he worked hard to run the school and cultivate a lot of talents. There is now a white marble bust statue of the old president of Pu yong on the campus of Kai Leung Secondary School. \\nPu yong good calligraphy, enjoy the reputation of Jiangnan a pen. He was born in the book Xiangmen, his father Puwenqiu as the former Qingxiu, Jiangnan famous calligrapher, Pu yong has been taught by the young, is, grass, Li, seal can, especially in the grass, book famous, but also can anti-book, and often cure the print, or painting, during the resistance war and after victory had been held in Shanghai alone or in cooperation with people many times Jinshi Calligraphy Exhibition. On the pillars of Suzhou West Park, the couplets that he wrote are still alive today. Mr. Pu yong can poetry, his life left more than 2,000 poems, not published. Mr. Hu Juewen is also a person of Jiading, very much appreciated his talents. He had praised Pu yong 'poem essay oblique, gold stone sword god'. During his tenure as vice-chairman of the National People's Congress, Hu Juelao invited him to book the book title and design cover in Beijing. During his visit to the monuments of Beijing, he was very enthusiastic at the age of 14. Puolao said that at that time I became an eye-catching figure, and I saw a touch of smile in his deep wrinkles. A famous literary in Shanghai in the 340s of the last century, Puyong once signed a long hair head, imagined that he had long hair in that year would have been a table of talent. I don't know Pu for a long time, and the people around me feel like the people around me that his talent is being curbed. After the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee, the pen in his hands was busy again, asking him to write more and more. He never rejected it, as if it was to save the lost time, and he was overloaded busy. I asked him to inscribe the nameplate of Nanxiang Hospital, and he was pleased to say that he lifted up a large pen, full of black lacquer, and waved on the white-lacquered wooden board. \\nHe told me that before liberation to write a longevity word for the rich, he could gain fame and gain, but he would rather have two sleeves of breath, nor would he want to write a word for the affluent. On the eve of the liberation of Jiading, he was shot out by agents outside the school, when the PLA gunfire was close, the fleeing agent walked and fired a few shots at him, and bullets were worn in the back neck pillow, and he fell in blood to survive. Why this is probably because he is the head of the Jiading branch of the NLD, actively engaged in anti-civil war, war and democratic activities, and has links with Lorongki. He has more frequent contact with him, plus Peng Dehuai's wife Uo Yasu, Pu Xixiu's sister is his cantonal nephew, and he became white. Color the victims of horror. As a result, he used the pseudonym of the 'Soviet people'. However, in the age of suspicion and justifiability, his neck's gun scar became the evidence of the guilt of the 'subtle' bitterness, being held in the hat of 'historical counter-revolutionaries' and criticized for eight years. He, like all traumatized intellectuals, had to withstand it only in silence, and it was not until 1978 when the 'historical counter-revolution' was removed, and the 'misguided rightists' were corrected in 1979, and the 'Soviet people' were rectified again. In his poem, he felt: 'The rest of his life is blessed to see the haze sweep, and to make a step \\nIn the early 1980s, in order to resume the establishment of the NLD organization in Jiading, he carefully considered, liaised with many parties, actively and securely developed representatives to participate in the NLD. I was introduced by him and Mr. Mao Yin of the NLD Municipal Committee to join the League in October 1981. At that time, Jiading NLD was a branch with only 11 members. And now it's a committee with more than 200 allies. When people talk about Jiading NLD, they will recall the effort that Pu has paid for it. At that time he served as a consultant to the Jiading Museum, he worked diligently to protect cultural relics and collect information. On sick leave, he lived to the daughter's home of Nanyang Road in urban areas. In order to work for the NLD or to meet in Jiading, the day is not bright to go out to catch a long-distance car, often with a cold fever, but he has no complaints. On a few weekdays, he came to my house with crutches to discuss work. From Nanyang Road to West Nanjing Road, it was not far away, but there was no direct car. It took more than half an hour on foot. When he walked on the third floor, he was full of spirit and emotion when he walked on the third floor. At that time, the NLD had no office, did not have full-time cadres, and many of his work had to do so. From the work plan to the annual summary, it was his own pen. Once his toes were swelling, he shelved his sick legs. Remember one time after Professor Qian Weichang made a wonderful report at the NLD Municipal Committee, Pu Lao made a special trip to the League Municipal Committee to borrow the only record, and spent a lot of time copied in full to convey it to the NLD branch meeting. After the meeting, the copy was also circulated to absentees. The style was moved. \\nIn 1981, he served as vice-chairman of the Fifth Committee of Jiading County of the CPPCC, and in 1982 he was hired as a librarian in Shanghai. In the central location of Jiading Zhang Ma has a new home, old lady moved from the city to live with, the younger daughter also moved from the field to Jiading work. His less spacious room became a meeting room and office. When I went, I saw that he was receiving visitors, often afterwards. It was really a city in the courtyards. He told me that many of the historical materials of Jiading's late Qing Dynasty asked him to identify and collate, many cultural relics need to be protected and restored; several descendants of the Xinhai Revolution at home and abroad have to reply to the old; problems and difficulties reflected by the allies need to help resolve. On one occasion, he also went to Huangdu Health Hospital in the suburbs of the county to visit the disease-threatening allies, which was moved, and still has been propagated as a good talk. \\nThirty years have passed away, Mr. Pu yong died, and his talents and spirit were alive. In conceiving this short article, I found out the letter he wrote to me with a brush on March 6, 1980, in which there was a paragraph: 'Ten years of havoc, planted a disease for me, but the future of four is good, and it should be strong!' \\nAs his people, words like their people, Mr. Pu yong's talents and skeletness make my people admire and miss. \\nPuxi Xiu and Puyong have suffered untold tribulations, and their pens have left unforgettable memories for people.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached] Tianjin Public Bureau Branch: Decision on Expulsion of Puzhangfu and Kong Xianpu Party Membership (1958.2.4)\\nPuzhangfu, male, 42 years old, Shanxi Huoxian, poor peasant composition, peasant origin, 1937 to participate in the work, 1942, is the first deputy director of the public bureau, party secretary. \\nKong Xianpu, male, 49 years old, Hebei Anguo County people, peasant origin, peasant origin, joined the party in 1938, working in 1938, is currently the second deputy director of the Public Bureau, deputy secretary of the party group. \\nIn May 1957, after the beginning of the whole winds movement, through the masses of the party and abroad of our Bureau, they thoroughly exhibited and criticized Puzhangfu and Kong Xianpu for a long period of time for mutual power, pulling and pulling into sectarian struggles among cadres. After the beginning of the wind, the municipal committee issued a warning to Pu and Kong and instructed that his personal problems should be laid down, and participated in the fight against the right, but not only did they not accept this advice, but they actually developed to shelter and exploit right-wing elements to attack each other. When self-aware mistakes are serious, many parties try to disguise, or even openly enter into a defensive alliance to resist the party's censorship against them. The main mistakes they made are the following:\\nPuzhangfu and Kong Xianpu moved to the Public Service Bureau in 1953 and showed mutual disrespect and disobedience in relations. Kong thinks that Pu does not respect the leadership of the Party Committee and does not discuss anything with him, but only I have exclusive respect and arbitrariness. Pu thinks that Kong used the powers of the Party Committee secretary to deliberately coerce him and so on. Pu was later identified as the first deputy secretary and secretary of the party group, and Kong as the second deputy secretary and deputy secretary of the party group, and in terms of relations worsened, so that in disregard of the interests of the party, each and one faction broke up each other. \\nIn 1954, after Puzhangfu was accused of having committed mistakes such as ambiguous positions, selfishness and engages in gender relations, Kong Xianpu used the opportunity to spread rumors and said that Pu had always spoken and deceived the Party Committee. Puzhangfu thinks that hole is intentionally engaged in him, not humbly checking himself. After the rebellion began, the former Municipal Commission for Disciplinary Affairs instructed Kong to put down the issue of Pu for the time being, pending the exercise to deal with it. However, Kong secretly pursued the problem of Pu. Not only did Kong secretly send cadres to Pu's origin and investigate Pu's family composition issues, and at the same time suggested to the Transportation Bureau that Pu has problems and that Pu's lover × × (deputy head of the transport company's protection section), participate in the work of the five-person group, in case the so-called × bullet bulls. During the rebellion, the then public party committee propaganda minister × took part in the executive work, and asked the director Xue Pinxuan (democratic person), and Puzhangfu to report to × × at work. Many parties imposed blockade, hardship and blow on Pu. In 1956, at the end of the Party Committee, Kong, in order to establish personal authority and beat each other, tried to pull and pull in cadres and develop sectarian forces. He decided to arrange his close ties to the water company manager and deputy director of the Party Committee Office × × as deputy manager. When the tram manager × was subjected to party warnings and administrative action due to death, the hole when facing × × said: 'You don't be sad, guarantee you three months to cancel the penalty.' And several times in cadres have declared to promote × × as deputy director. Attempts to pull × × et al attack Puzhangfu. \\nPuzhangfu's above behavior towards Kong is also not based on the desire to unite and help the Party organization to clear the problems, but rather resentment in the heart and take the opportunity to revenge. In 1956, the Municipal Supervisory Commission checked again on the basis of the original complaint, proving that Puzhangfu had some mistakes in his political position and ideological style, especially with regard to Li Shaobi, former deputy manager of water supply company (formerly pseudo-Tianjin Mayor Du Jianshi private secretary and participated in anti-Japanese hoe regiment), which was not disposed of only because the circumstances of the error were minor. But soon, Puji wrote article 43 to the Municipal Supervisory Commission, sued Kong Xianpu, believing that the hole 'ear and eye' was placed in his 'base place', and encouraged water company manager × × × ×, deputy director of office x x x x x x, deputy director of office x x x x x x and other comrades with him a complaint to the municipal committee. After learning that Kong became more dissatisfied with Pu, spreading resentment among the cadres, thinks that the failure of the municipal committee to dispose of Pu is the right to deal with the cadres who committed mistakes, and so on. At this point, the relationship between the two sides has grown to no cooperation at all. Pu want to go to work, hole 'sick leave', visit the theater, or to find workers on the line to chat in the name of in-depth work; when starting a party group meeting, one does not come, one does not use work, collect materials to attack each other. \\nIn 1957, Pu used the opportunity of some officers of the water supply company who were dissatisfied with the upgrade of × 1956, and distributed eight anonymous letters four times, which were sent by mail to the head of the water company section and section chief and above cadres (mostly non-party and historical people). In addition to questioning why x x increase in wages more than 13%, abusive hole and x x is sectarian, and provoked the relationship between the tram company, bus company, water supply company, said hole instructed the personnel section to dig up the water company's meat, replenish the sores of the tram companies, bus companies, invite letter collectors and tap water. All the cadres of the company gathered in the central park, petitioned the municipal committee and the municipal federation of trade unions, in order to enlarge contradictions and incite the masses To knock down the hole. \\nAfter the wind began in May 1957, Pu and Kong used right-wing elements to attack each other in order to achieve the despicable bourgeoisie individualism. Pu Zeng called the cadre of the defence section and attacked him by saying that the hole pulled the sectarian in the form of When Shen Quan, a far-right activist in our administration (always hate our party, tried to organize a 'third party', and was censored when it was censored), spread anti-socialist remarks and deeds against the opposition, and attacked Puzhangfu, Kong paid great praise to Shen, not only publicly praised Shen at the mass congress, and supported Shen several times in talks with Shen. and encouragement. In June 1957, when our Bureau held a general public congress, Kong, in order to take this opportunity to further attack Puzhangfu, spoke with Shen separately before the meeting. Shen wanted to mention the 'opinions' that had been raised in the conference. At the same time, he told Shen Quan that the anti-socialist anti-socialist words and deeds spread by Shen Quan were only 'skewed'. 'What', promised to study Shen's entry into the party after the whole wind. After Shen Quan was encouraged by Kong Zhi, the more vicious attack on Pu at the meeting was 'the Communist Party scum', 'Shun us the Chang, and the death of us' and so on. When Shen's reactionary performance provoked the indignation of the masses, Kong not only prevented the rebuttal of the masses, but after Shen reported his criticism to Kong, angrily said to Shen: 'Are you the intellectuals bishops? Have you ignited? Your historical question has already been concluded. Who says there's a problem with your history, let him come to me!' And again encouraged Shen to persuade: 'Shen Quan has a culture. It is a promising youth, and should not be narrowly minded.' It is also absurd to say that Shen Quan should be 'cultivated as Chairman Mao' \\nIn June 1957, when the party group expanded meeting to study the delineation of the right-wing elements such as Shen Quan and Li Shaobi, Kong did not express his attitude towards Shen, believing that Li Shaobi was a crony of Pu, said Li's problem was serious and should be set as the right, while Pu stressed that the Shen persuasive problem should be a serious problem, should be set to the right, and he did not express an attitude towards Shen and Li were unable to identify as right as early because they were biased by each side. Kong Xianpu is also aware of Yu Fanping's behavior of far-right activists Yu Fanping (party members), who consistently oppose Pu's behavior. After the appearance of the right was exposed, after Yu's right-wing face was exposed, Kong still consciously collected from Yu for the shortcomings of Pu's trailer work, while spreading to Yu that he did not know the upgrade of cadres of party members above level 16. Yu not upgraded), to inspire Yu against Pu's dissatisfaction. Later Kong learned that Yu publicly defended the voice of the right-wing elements of the horse tree in the masses, and actively sought more individual conversations, if they needed to rectify them quickly. When Yu Van's anti-socialist rhetoric and deeds were revealed, until August, the party group discussions unanimously decided that the rest of the ordinary were right-wing elements, but Kong did not speak quietly at the meeting, and during the struggle for the rest of the ordinary, Shen Quan, not only did not participate in the struggle, but instead spread out Shen was a 'cannon' behind it. \\nPuzhangfu also did not support the attack of Kong. In July 1957, he wrote a long draft anonymous letter, written by his long-term concubine x x x x (party member, current director of the tobacco factory), and put into our bureau opinion box. In this letter, in addition to attacking holes for a consistent sectarian activity, 'Shun Zhichang, the death of the insurgent', crowding out and blow out on cadres from the water supply company, and said: Kong 'can serve, play the book' and so on. Then in July 1957, I sent an anonymous letter to my bureau of the wind office, saying that Kong and the head of the personnel section of our Bureau x x x x x x chopped sectarian, and said: × is Gullov, eat all day, no intentions, oppose × participation in the windy leadership group. Following the start of the anti-right faction, Pu thought that Yu Fanping and Shen Quan were 'red people' of Kong, mixed with personal ingredients in the struggle, and showed exceptionally positive. When revising Shen Quan materials, he unjustifiably described Yu Van as a small group with Shen Quan. By September, at the mass congress, it was said more unequivocally: the right-wing Meng Jiange was aware of the anti-party material in Baotou city. When Yu Fanping and Shen Quan gave successively an account of the situation of Kong's individual conversations with them and suggested that their anti-party anti-socialism was affected by hole, Puji believed that he had seized the hole's braids and performed more positively. Several times the wind office had to copy the materials from Yu and Shen handed over to the municipal committee and the party committee. Not only that, but also use the masses to reflect the promotion and living allowance is unreasonable. Before the problem of multiplying × is not resolved, in addition to many times spread × unconsciously among the masses, and in September 1957, two times posted in our Bureau to attack holes and × is sectarian, saying that × do not downgrade because of boring, etc. After Kong see the anonymous article was greatly dissatisfied, believing that Pu was the right, and suggested that he would rather make mistakes to clarify the anonymity article. And Puzhangfu is doing everything possible to prevent and not be traced. \\nAt this time, Puzhangfu not only attacked Kong Xianpu, and once again provided cover for right-wing Lee Shaobi. In September 1957, Comrade Jiang Baozhong, who was sent to our bureau to help work in the winds, according to Li Shaobi's anti-socialist anti-socialist words and deeds, was considered to constitute the right. After speaking to Pu, Pu not only whispered, but secretly instructed the cadres of my bureau to put Li Shaobi, Yu Wenpan and Yang Xingxue to the middle, the middle and left Lala (the three are the right), Pu said: 'Li Shaobi and other people are behind, such as struggle The masses also said that we 'six pro not', the Communist Party turned off his face and did not recognize people'; when the office cadre suggested that Li Shaobi's remarks should be criticized, Pu still believed that pulling to the middle and the left side was good, and criticized the office cadres as youth party members, and had preferred to think about the problem.. \\nIn October 1957, when the party group was preparing to study the identification of Li as a right-wing, Li Shaobi also felt serious problems and tried to escape the struggle. He asked Pu to travel to Shanghai on a business trip to Shanghai. Pu did not prevent it and immediately approved (later stopped). Since the party group discussed the determination of Li as the right, Kong Xianpu has also shown an exceptionally positive stance, strongly urging the Office of the Breeze Office to report Li Shaobi's material to the city in advance. \\nThe mistakes made by Puzhangfu and Kong Xianpu are serious. Their attitude towards the wrong is also very bad. Many parties have managed to disguise, refuse to examine and confess, in an attempt to mingle. Puzhangfu thinks that he has always been a composer, 'wrong' is full of frustration. Kong Xianpu, for his part, suggested that they simply did not have any problems of ununity, but that the municipal committee consciously engaged them. Although the leadership has repeatedly educated, helped, and waiting for their consciousness, but their attitude, not only did not change, but in December 1957, Kong invited Pu to eat and to work with a good means, the two people together, set up an alliance against each other, and agreed not to expose each other, and unanimously confronted Party organization. and actively seek out the wind among the cadres, spreading the problem of the two people has been resolved, and there is nothing to examine; and held separate conversations with the vast majority of party member section chiefs to blur the audience's audiovisual; especially, Kong Xianpu pulled up the cadres by means of a closed officer's wish, trying to get the cadres up to talk to them. Words. In order to scatter the cadres who struggle against their mistakes, they have not only changed the original organizational form of our Bureau, tried to redivide the weigh study group according to the new form of organization, and sent the two party member section chiefs to Beijing to work in order to keep the cadres out for a long time, in order to benefit their resistance activities. At the same time, trying to reverse the sight of the masses and spread 'the central focus of the whole wind spirit is anti-waste'. Puzhangfu and treat the comrades who actively fight against them mistakenly as an enemy, openly threatened: now he had no command of the whole wind office, the whole wind command was surrounded by the enemy, and the comrades who wanted the office to be in line with his thoughts. The bad attitude of their confrontational organization until it was revealed by the masses, although it began to change and initially account for some wrong behavior, their attitude was still very unhonest, especially by Kong Xianpu's refusal to fully account for his main false facts. \\nIt is not accidental that Puzhangfu and Kong Xianpu made such a serious mistake. Over the years, they have consistently shown arrogance, emphasizing the role of the individual and taking advantage of a better position. In this regard, the municipal committee and relevant party organizations have criticized them and educated them. However, they have always insisted on the idea of the bourgeois individualism, and they have repeatedly taught them, so that they gradually develop to shelter the right to destroy the interests of the Party. Each party pulls out each other, pulls and rips among the cadres, fabricates rumors, provokes alienation, misleading and misleading, and acting on a sectarian struggle, causing extreme gravity to the Party. The loss and impact. Based on the above erroneous facts, it is proved that Pu/Kong two have completely lost the conditions for members of the Communist Party. In order to seriously party discipline and educate the whole party, the branch assembly decided to dismiss Puzhangfu and Kong Xianpu, and recommended that the administration remove all their duties. \\nGeneral Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC): Compilation of Decisions on Expulsion from Party Membership \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\)\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"}

This year is an already ugly year cattle. Nien says cattle 'cattle turn to kun' Cattle and twist is Kaiyin, twist word can be folded into cattle hand and foot, have a lot of strength, the '' word also from cattle. Qiankun represents the universe of heaven and earth nature, the cosmic ontology is constantly running according to certain laws. Not all animals can be reversed, including humans can only recognize and respond to nature. In the face of the global economic crisis this year, China's economy is steadily downward, and there are still many business opportunities to develop. Jingtailan porcelain like 'Cattle to Qiankun' is a fine craft by Beijing artist Zhang Tonglu. 'Cattle to Qiankun' Jingtylan is famous in the world, a King Tailan price will cost 40,000 yuan. \\nAfter retirement I learned 'Yi Ching', practicing Tai Chi, 'I Ching' is not a regular study, but Tai Chi does insist on practicing every day. Recently, idle and want to learn a bit of philosophical culture, encountered a lot of problems, especially in the philosophical sciences. Last year I wrote a 'Learning Wang Tianyuan Teacher Tai Chi Heart Method'. Looking for advice from teachers who want to teach philosophy. So I thought of two professors Cao Fangjiu and Wang Youshu. After sending the original to teacher Cao, I asked him for advice on the phone. He suggested that I should look for an expert scholar from the Chinese language department or history department, and he said 'I have no interest in this regard.' He pushed me away from Hachijo by two words. I asked Mr. Wang Youshu, right now? He said that King Ji had lived in the hospital to recognize no one. I heard it steeply and I felt half cut off my body. At the age of the king is smaller than me, I usually meet me called his brother. At that time, I climbed again to teacher Cao and wanted to entangle him. I speak Chinese and historical school experts, I can't recognize it all, and I don't want to look for either. I myself have no name, two not for the benefit, only want to communicate with each other's thoughts. I said that at present, I am different from Wang Youchu. I can also recognize people, but only your teacher Cao alone. I have not contacted teacher Cao since then. In such a situation where there is no way, I can only pull Shiraz on paper. Please criticize the wrong point, in case you say the point, can only be said to be my own learning experience, keep myself and future people to see, at most to give friends to visit advice, it is worth not everyone as a reference. \\nWang Youshu Wu graduated from Leshan, Sichuan in 1948, was an activist in Wu's student movement. After liberation into the University of China and Peking Renmin University. In 1951, he has been teaching philosophy in China University and China teachers. Mrs. Wu Guiying graduated from Huazhong Agricultural University and worked at the Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Wu was transferred to the Chinese division during the Cultural Revolution, as a pot-end to Honghu. Together we were 57 warriors. In 1973, we were all transferred back to Huashi Nanhu Farm by Honghu. I put cattle and teacher Wang labor often meet a smile. After retirement, he wrote some memories of decentralizing Honghu during the Cultural Revolution. Most of him showed me, written very real and human. Wu Hui farm after becoming a farm technician. At the end of February, the lunar lunar soaked cereal species in the reservoir in early March, then the pond water was still a bit cold soaked, she first took the lead in playing barefoot, swelling under the legs in the pond. Don't look at her slimming and Na is a little bitter. We often joked with her at that time, shouting her 'no technology' and asked her to come up with technology for us to produce millions of grains. A few years ago she went through her life. I personally and teacher Wang family and some of their children, finally have such a relationship. \\nCao Fangjiu Henan Huang people, when they were young, thought very positive progress. Before liberation, he read Marx's 'Capital Theory'. During the anti-Japanese war, we had students in the Nanyang war zone middle school. He was a class higher than me. He was expelled from school at Anyang High School. Later, his father turned to his friends into the war zone high school. Although we have different classes but classrooms are adjacent, we often meet after class. He probably had no impression of me because he was a new transponder. But I was particularly impressed with him, and since I never saw this person, new arrivals would always be noticeable. When he was young, ruddy, symmetrical, dashing and elegant, we have never had a face-to-face conversation. Before liberation, he was in the 29th team of Zhongyuan University, and I was in the 30 team. I thought the face was familiar, but did not say hello. After coming to China, he married his teacher He Manhua. For some time we were living in Wuchang Chongfushan Street Old Library College. He graduated from Nanjing foreign college, good at English, kindness and kindness to people, sincere care for others. Remember that the student right teacher Yang Zai Sui (now teaching scholar education expert), nearly 30 years old in the 1970s last century, no one dare to stick, class enemies who Nor dare twist He tried ways to help him. Another right-sized teacher Wang Yuansheng, in his 30s, was also introduced by Teacher He. Teacher Cao and couple are very passionate about people. After retiring in 1991, Qiu He invited me to perform 24-style Taijiquan at the Old Association of Nanhu School, so I came to Nanhu first to visit his home. At that time, Teacher Cao said he was finishing up the legacy of the old principal Wei Zhuomin and ready to publish. I feel very admired as soon as I listened to, because Wei Zhuomin has made a great contribution to both Chinese and world culture. Teacher Cao also continues to work hard for his cultural contribution. Later, my family also moved to Guizishan, and I learned to practice tai chi together with teacher Cao, contact more. \\nI had another turn with Mr. Wei Zhuomin. In 1974, we all came to the school on a school bus like Rouge Road in the city, and I was working on the farm. He and Dai Huiqiong woman just married soon, he said to us: 'The most happy and enjoyable time of life, is the cave flower candle night gold list title, I now round everyone's dream.' Listen to my voice, I misunderstood what he meant at that time, as if it was made by everyone, not necessarily his own initiative. As to whether he and Dai Huiqiong's female soil had affection, I did not know at that time. At that time, I was in a little witch situation, dare to talk, not even the word 'congratulations'. Later it was learned that they met at Oxford University in 1937, when 7.7 incidents began, Japan invaded China, and the British media reported as headlines. They each buy a newspaper to watch outside the Oxford Church. Wei passion angry, angry face grief; wearing a newspaper while watching tears. The media was filmed down as a Chinese attitude towards the incident, and the next day they reported in the newspaper together with photos. During the war of resistance, China moved to Xizhou, Yunnan, and Wei Pindai as a foreign language teacher. Until after the victory of the war against China moved back to Wuchang site. Wei's son Wei Bao-e after liberation married Dai Qichen, his niece, Dai Shichen, and Dai's nephew married Huang Jimei, daughter of education expert Huang Pu. \\nIn 1957, Wei was beaten as the leader of 'Wei, Dai, Huang opposition group', Wei Baoye, Dai Qichen, Dai Shichen, Huang sent the United States, their two couples and both of them were not spared the right hat. We all have a bit of affection. He graduated from University in 1940 and received a Ph.D. in Physics from Yale University in 1950. After returning home, he was a professor of physics at HuaUniversity. I was a clerk in the physics department office in 1952. He later moved to Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. I was a data clerk in the Department of Chemistry in 1957. Dai Shichen and Zhang Ze-xiang are chemistry faculty members and Wei Zu-cho. We are playing the right together in the Department of Chemistry. Together, he went to the grass lake farm to reform labor. When he first arrived on the farm, Dai Qichen wore high heels, and the heel was pulled out by the yellow clay, and was used as an agro-worker and delegated cadre as talking about the Weizu-cho after the tune of Yichang, left orphaned widows Mohuilan, Wei Wei and Wei Qiao. Wei Baoe, Huang Zhi Mei are all gone, not known how Dai Qichen. \\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, I and Dai Shichen and Zhang Zexiang worked on the Huashi farm. The location is now the sports college. Chemistry Department of villain students pulled, Zhang back to accept the batter, wear a high hat, once after 12 noon I put cattle on the farm, saw them two after fighting back to the farm, the sun did not eat at noon, walk some plumbing, was beaten with skin, young nose, eyes, wearing the mouth still With bright red blood. Each of them also held a high hat in their arms, ready to take it again the next time they marry. In 1970, Dai Shichen Huang sent the American family, a pot end to Honghu Bird's Nest District settled, we were 57 soldiers together. When in Honghu, local dignitaries, their family was willing to go to Hanyang Zhuankou Paper Mill. When implementing the policy in 1979, they were afraid to return to China teachers, and as a result they arranged to Hubei University. \\nOn the eve of the liberation of Wuhan, Bai Chongxi and Hubei Governor mobilized Wei Zhuomin to support transportation vehicles. They wanted Hua University to move to Guilin, Guangxi. At that time, Wei Zhuomin, as the president of the University of China University, did not listen to, resolutely not to move, to send two months' salary stability to the university's teaching staff. Protect the underground party group propaganda activities and greet the PLA. Zhang Zexiang, Ning Yunmou, Wang Ling, they all experienced that scene in person, more clearly. From all aspects of age learning, Wei Zhuomin is my elders. I am very respectful to Mr. Wei personally. I think he has a very high degree of theoretical and intellectual insight throughout China and West. In 1947 he wrote a book in English called 'Chinese Culture', published in New York. Avoked the admiration of Harvard Fizhengqing and many American scholars, all believe that Chinese culture is magnificent. Chiang Kai-shek hired Wei Zhuomin as China's ambassador to the United States, and was rejected by Mr. Wei. He did not insist on his own academic education for personal fame. My recent knowledge of his experiences is all the more admirable. \\nWei Zhuomin was born in 1888 in Zhuhai, Guangdong. His father was a tea merchant. 13 years old by his father to bring Wuchang church school, first reading bikan (equal to secondary school), 19 years old admission (equal to university undergraduate), 23 years old is graduated as a teacher, baptized into Christianity, is the success of the 1911 Revolution in 1911. After studying a Master of Philosophy degree at Harvard University, the United States, still back to school after graduation. His university thesis discusses China's ethics and ethics in accordance with the Book and the Remnants, while his thesis in Harvard philosophy expands on the political thinking of China's Meng Zi. And both papers were written in English. Later, he studied at universities in London, Paris and Berlin in Europe and received a Ph.D. degree. Universities in Europe and the United States often invite him to give academic speeches. He studied Kant and Hegel's philosophy very deeply. Translate Kant's three major criticisms and notes Hegel's little logic. Of course, the scholar expert translating these books is not just him alone. But he corrected some misinterpretations in Kant's Pure Rational Criticism, and I most appreciate his change of 'negation' to 'abandon' and 'faith' to 'faith.' Because these concepts are all centimeter difference, some time difference is massively, for example, take the concepts of 'negation' and 'abandon' two concepts: 'negation' is completely thrown away, and 'abandon' seems to be a farmer in the same way as fengyang grain on the sun, do not have something blown away by the natural wind, left behind Something is exactly what humanity needs. Also, although the two concepts of 'faith' and 'belief' are the difference between the word, but its connotation is very different, take the word 'admit' and 'read' to compare the word, 'standing' is 'high mountain to stop' steadfastness, and the word 'read' is the word 'today' and 'heart' word, I think about reasonable things today I have the heart to miss For a moment, there is no mind about irrational things that can not be remembered, is a change of confidence or not. Kant himself did not necessarily believe in religion, and God in his heart was hypothetical, so his doctrine was forbidden by the church at the time and revoked his teaching duties. Kant lived 80 years old life unmarried, skinny body, strong concept of time, daily work, life is very regular. \\nMr. Wei has a lot of research on Kant's academic thinking. Mr. Wei himself is meticulous and flexible, very scientific and rigorous to people, especially in terms of learning, let others leave room for themselves, not to engage in absolute. Translation is not an easy task, especially in the humanities, where natural sciences can do experiments on the fly. Humanities theories need to be validated over a long period of time. Translators first need to understand the cultural conditions of both sides, but also to understand the personality of the author. Translated works to do letter, da, ya. The standard conditions of the translation letter, Da, Ya, were first proposed by the Indian high monk Dove Moros in Dongjin, to Qing Wei, the first president of Peking University, also repeatedly stressed that translation should be done letter, Da, Ya. Strongly translated many Western cultures, such as Adam Smith's theory of national wealth and the sociology of Spencell. He translated sociology as 'Group of Words'. Very practical and concrete. Matter by class, people divided by groups. As a child, I have also participated in the children's subgroup, called a shift, you shift, I don't go with him. Sometimes fights are called war, began to fool, flames on the real fight. Adults playing large groups is war. Now weapons progress to launch missiles, but the crowd is always inseparable. War is cruel, dead and destroyed. Past gangs are also a combination of interests of the crowd. 'Help' and 'will' initially used as verbs, you help me and I help each other. You and me when he meets each other. For a long time have become the name of a noun, like Qinghong gang, Zhejiang, homecoming, classrooms, and so on. The problem is farther below to say a little positive. \\nIn fact, Kant wanted to explore the whole heart of the monolithic, and later people planned him as a prior-theistic mentalist. I want to learn about Kant agnostics and Hegel's absolute spiritual theory, but no one can tell himself to dare to dare to touch. I would like to ask Professor Cao Fangjiu for help, and his reply is 'no interest in this.' \\nThere is no way only to decide to blind touch...\\nSome say that Old Pan chuansong now believes in Buddha. Don't dare, really elevate me. I was not qualified or expected at all. I have not kept the law of the world, full of greed, musty, slow, suspicious. There is no way into the Dharma's fixed, ring, and Hui. I do not burn incense paper, two do not enter the Buddha Tang, three do not meditate. All forms of life are the same as old. Now most people are superstitious, formally do it to others. Shakyamuni is alive also a man, and he wants to eat and sleep, and urine. He taught people not to superstition, not to worship idols. Be a return to the true freedom of the people. In honor of his great divine thoughts, learn the spirit of his knowledge of life in the universe and call him Buddha. Hanwen 'Buddha' word folded away to see (is), 'not human', you call him God, fairy, ghost, monster, demon, bastard can, anyway is not human. \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 4"}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached 1】Ji Xichen: The Ugly Right Group of Sichuan (People's Daily, 1957.8.30)\\nThe massive anti-right struggle is being carried out in all walks of life in Sichuan. In this battle of life and death, a decisive battle is the siege of Sichuan branch of Zhangluo Union led by Pan dakui. \\nLong Mou to build 'alliance world', right leaders gathered in Chengdu\\nThe material proves that Zhangluo Union, known as the 'birthplace', 'base' and 'big position' of the NLD, has been deployed and prepared long before liberation. After Liu Deng Dajun crossed the river, they believed that under the situation of the 'North-South confrontation of the Communist Party', there was a great deal to be done. In order to achieve the goal of 'cutting from the southwest' in the 'three-point world', NLD right-wing elements Pan dakui, Fan Puzhai, Zhang Zhihe, Zhang Songtao, etc., according to Zhang Bojun's instructions to expand their strength to engage in military speculation, except Pulling a large number of robes (that is, old party), landlords bullies agents into the Union (such as Sichuan West 15 counties 668 people, half (The above is the landlord robe gothic agent), at the same time in North Sichuan, South Sichuan, Xikang and other places to assemble robes and bandits, to establish reactionary local armed forces, conspiracy to compete with the people in an attempt to resist the PLA's entry into Chuankang. Zhu Shizheng, the head of the bandits who owns more than two or three thousand robes and robbed the masses everywhere, was appointed by them as the chairman of the NLD Xikang Provincial Committee. After liberation, these reactionary forces launched counter-revolutionary riots. After the first rebellion by NLD Central Committee member Zhang Zhi and Wang Dequan, head of the pseudo-security corps, along with Zhu Shizheng and other bandits, also took part in the rebellion. Zhang Songtao set up a five-member group in Neijiang, which became the core of the rebellion after liberation. Under the leadership of bandits, He Zhenhua and Deng Shuren, the chairman of the Neijiang NLD, participated in the pre-organization of the anti-Communist Army, attacked two district offices and seven or eight townships in the Neijiang area alone, killing 42 people and rural activists, killing 42 people and rural activists. The stamps of the 'Chuankang People's Self-Defense Army Fourth Column' and 'General Command of the Anti-Republican Salvation Army' were also made by the NLD chairman member personally. \\nFor several years, right-wing ambitions have carried out a series of conspiracy activities in order to further control the alliance and seize the leadership of the Sichuan NLD. Lorongki, who claimed his life 'to know the end of the struggle', far back in the summer of 1951, held a secret gathering of Sichuan 'intangible organizations' backbone elements in Beijing, instructing Pan dakui, Zhang Songtao, etc., to use the method of 'organizing to organize' to conspiracy to contact a group of old agent bullies who were cleaned out in the southwest. 'Allied members', plotting out the leadership of the South-West NLD center-left elements. The new three anti-China again created an 'fast mail generation and electricity' incident, which took the opportunity to strike Chutunan and Tian Yiping in an attempt to directly seize the leadership of the Southwest NLD. After the withdrawal of the region, Luolongji insisted that Pan dakui stay in Sichuan and echoed with Yunnan Li Dejia. Pan dakui, in order to further consolidate the development of this 'stronghold', pulled together Korean Wenqi, Shu Jun, Li Kang, Hu Kelin, Feng Kexi, Wu Zhongping, Liu Kunnan, etc., to form the core small group of 'intangible organizations' in Sichuan. In order to make the NLD Sichuan Provincial Committee completely become the anti-Communist command of the right-wing elements, they also use despicable means such as buying and provoking, to pull people inside the NLD provincial and municipal organs to form a small group of internal organs of the NLD provincial and municipal committees, and attack the party at the moment they have an opportunity to attack the party. \\nAs a member of the Kuomintang, Pan dakui, who had close contact with Zhang Qun, was a landlord bully with a thousand hundreds of Ishida. When his brother was held in custody, bully brother and nephew were suppressed, it became more hatred and dissatisfaction with the Party, blatantly slandering land reform and rebellion. Although he has been the vice-chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, a member of the chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the NLD and the people's deputies of the whole country, he is still not satisfied, believing that 'the NLD has no right status' and that his activities should be deputy governor After the Party proposed the policy of 'long-term coexistence, mutual supervision', 'flowers are in line, and hundreds of families contested' policy, they believe that the new situation has arrived, so they have become more rampant in their activities. When Luolongji, Fan Puzhai, Ma Zhemin, Liu Wang Liming, Pan dakui, Zhang Songtao, and so on in December, Chengdu, Luolongji directed them to compare forces with the Party and 'the NLD want to monopolize intellectuals.' They believe that as long as the senior intellectuals are in the hands of the NLD, there are more prestigious people within the League and there are more leading positions, then the party cannot fail to pay attention to the strength of the League. This forced the party to retreat and then replace it, starting with taking the leadership of the cultural and religious circles, and further overthrowing the proletarian dictatorship and establishing a 'alliance world'. \\nBig development recruitment to buy horses, engage in peripheral strength\\nIn order to achieve this vicious plan, Pan dakui and others have used a variety of methods to expand the organization and strengthen the power of the right. In addition to openly calling that 'Sichuan NLD will develop 4,000 people this year', demand 'continuous development of river flows' in seven areas, carry out a 'socialist competition' of development organizations and expand the establishment of grass-roots organizations in 58 counties, and also pull a large number of historical anti-revolutionaries and dissatisfied parties into the Alliance. After the wind began, they advocated 'fire line entry', and Shu Jun had developed more than 140 people within 40 days of Chongqing. Under the policy of 'not refusing to come', Nie Pi Cheng, Yuechi County of the National Union, openly pulled people in the tea house in Guang'an City, and asked for non-union. \\nThe establishment of various peripheral 'strongholds' around the branch is an important tactical means for the right wing of the Sichuan NLD to expand its strength and consolidate its position. This kind of 'stronghold' is a small group of 'Xinshe' organized by NLD members and right activist in the art world Wang Zimei in Chongqing, and a 'women's restraint branch' organized by Zhang Luo Union female general Liu Wang Liming secretly in Chengdu. The president of this chapter is Yue Baoqi, a former representative of the Pseudo-National Congress and a women member of the Party Department of Sichuan Province of the Kuomintang Province. 16 of the other 18 members of the Council are anti-revolutionaries, reactionary landlords and family members of the counter-revolutionary. Many of the 147 newly developed members in a few days are 'distressed friends' sentenced by the government after liberation. In addition, there are 'Baihua Poems Society', which claims to be the NLD cadres training cadres. The poetry house, known as studying the classical literary heritage of the motherland, has more than 250 members in Chengdu, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai and Wuhan. There are liaisons in the various departments of the society, which meets once a week, while the meeting is 'kept secret' and no external information is allowed. Although they are called 'Poetry Society', there are many members of the community who will not do poetry. The poetry house has an intriguing purpose, which is to 'unite the intellectuals of all the parties who have not yet united.' That is to say, all those who are dissatisfied with the party should be pulled into this small group, so that 11 of the 21 social councillors of the 'Poetry Society' were initially identified as agents and the backbone of the reactionary group. Jiang Wenfang, an anti-revolutionary member, served as secretary of the 'poetry house' and liaison member of the General Affairs Department. Muzipo, chairman of the 'Poetry Society', is a viper who has consistently carried out anti-communist efforts. Because he is good at rumors and cheating, pulling old intellectuals, so he won Pan dakui's favor. Pan dakui first pulled him into the Union without organizing formalities, and then immediately supported him to organize the 'Baihua Poetry Society'. The aim is to take the hands of Muzipo, in the periphery of the Zhangluo Union Sichuan branch, and then plug a black flag for recruitment to buy horses. \\nThe black line is pervasive, put poison full attack\\nIn Sichuan branch, Pan dakui uses a variety of activities, invariably pass the fire, buried black lines. In addition to their personal legal status, they are divided and linked up and down, colluding with each other; in the form of tea party, 'transfer', guest, dinner form, holding secret rallies; with letters round-trip, individual contacts; at the same time, through meetings and training courses, arranging work, training cadres, placing their Reactionary platforms spread across grass-roots organizations. In August last year, Pan dakui organized a special 'NLD in-service cadre training course' for training minions to train NLD grassroots cadres in Nanchong, Zigong, Leshan, Ya'an, Suining, Santai and other places to open Zhangluo Union 'branch' in small and medium-sized cities. During the training, Fei Xiaotong, the right-wing activist, personally conveyed to them the agenda of the Zhangluo Union to incite intellectuals to attack the party. Pan dakui, Zhao Yiming, etc., and organized them to Sichuan Medical College to collect materials and exchange 'pilot' experiences at various divisions of the Chengdu NLD. \\nTo usurp the leadership of colleges, Pan dakui personally took advantage of the NLD organization and collected materials everywhere through his colleague relationships such as Tsinghua, the United States and the Southwest United Nations General Assembly. Pulling the right professors like Liu Zuyi, Zhang Yongyan, Zhang Zehou, Kang Zhenhuang, Zhang Maosheng, Yang Zhinong and other right-wing professors spread anti-party remarks, criticizing contradictions between the Party and the intellectuals, 'laymen cannot lead the internal affairs', slander the movements, and threatened 'not only for the living person, but also for the dead', stressed the need to repudiate Shelled at the Party Central Committee and Sichuan Provincial Committee. At the same time, they also led the ignition in more than a dozen colleges in Chengdu, in an attempt to create chaos and take the opportunity to put the Communist Party in a 'ring', and then the NLD will pick up the mess and overthrow the people's democratic dictatorship. For this reason, Pan dakui not only instructed his minions to siege the party committee of the Sichuan Institute of Finance and Economics on the 3rd way, but also attempted to organize a 'united war group' at Chengdu Institute of Exploration and Sichuan Normal College, to drive the Communist Party out of the school, and viciously call on students to 'ignite the fire of 5.4' and burn the Communist Party to death in the 'whole wind'. The right-wing elements of the Chengdu Institute of Technology have also openly drawn up a 'blacklist' and are ready to take over from the current dean, provost, and head of department. \\nIn Chongqing, Pan dakui is a unifying right force. First, two small groups of NLD Municipal Committee, Shu Jun, Li Kang and Feng Kexi and Hu Kelin, then Shu Jun and Li Kang, under the instructions of Fei Xiaotong, also under this group, contacted Li Chengyuan, Jiang Qingnan and Ye Qianji to organize a 'think tank'. Drafted ten points set fire 'instructions', held more than a thousand people mobilization conference, mobilized the 'League' Members are at the forefront of the struggle, inciting the allies to 'liquidate', 'pour down the water', 'sue' and 'sue' to the party, to take the lead on ignition, ask the alliance to do 'hats', 'send soldiers', 'rescue', 'defuse' and 'insurance' to the anti-revolutionaries, and use the tactics of 'layering, chasing' to 'each other' to 'each other' 'There is nothing to say.' \\nTheir clutches were also stretched into many small and medium-sized cities, bringing a number of NLD grass-roots organizations into a base point for their blow. Two senior generals of Pan dakui, Zhao Yiming and Zhang Songtao, called in May, such as Suining, Nanchong, Xichang, Luzhou, Santai city grass-roots leaders Liu Shiyi, Huang Dacheng, Zhang Jianbo and other secret rallies to study the 'new situation and new tasks', not only specify the task of setting fire, but also stipulate that 'if not complete any 'Disciplinary action'. Zhao Yiming told people: 'Democratic parties need to rectify a few things before they can be valued.' So, the deputy secretary-general of the NLD Provincial Committee personally went to Ya'an to carry out a 'pilot', and at the same time, incited Yaanong College students to relocate the school, igniting a fire. A veteran anti-Communist expert, who was a pseudo county minister and head of the pseudo protection corps before liberation, is currently a deputy chairman of Luzhou of the NLD, and went into the Xiqu community. Every effort was made to prevent entertainers from entering the (Communist), Party, saying, 'What are you doing in the (Communist), Party, and entering the NLD is the backbone', called Yang Songling handed over the 'Party Shen The Book is coming back and says, 'It's more sad than in the eighteenth floor of hell.' Incite the grassroots to ignition. \\nArsonists are revealed, small groups fall apart\\nMany of these arsonists came from anti-communists. On June 5, Pak Zhai, an insider officer of the Zhangluo Union and the Central Committee of the NLD Central Committee, who has always planned conspiracy activities in Sichuan, wrote 'Voice of Side Meeting' in the Guangming Daily to slander the Communist Party's loss of hearts and slandered 'the State Council is the root cause of bureaucracy' at the State Council colloquium. He was so hateful for the Communist Party because he had long been an anti-Communist expert. He was promoted by Pseudo-Gansu President Zhu Shaoliang as Chief of Staff (Secretary General), for anti-Communist forceful anti-Communist strength, from an ordinary inspector of a pseudo-police station, and a pseudo-Pingliang commissioner who blocked the Red Army north. He was also a political instructor for the pseudo-Sichuan training regiment during the resistance. Another battle in the Zhangluo Union will be Zhao Yiming, who was the head of the center team of the KMT Special Agent Revival Society, developed contacts with two or 30 agents, and disrupted the student movement. Later, when he was mixed with the NLD and served as NLD organization minister in Chongqing, on the eve of the 6.1 big arrest in Chongqing in 1947, the full list of Chongqing Allied members fell into the hands of agents. After the allied members were arrested and forced to hide, Zhao Yiming instead worked safely and without harm in Chongqing's 'Chuankang Xingye Company' as secretary commissioner to live in a small bungalow and take a private car. Zhang Zehou, a member of the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the NLD, who was particularly vicious in the show, fabricated history and disguised progress in the past, and always deceived the youth in the garment of the 'underground hero' in the scum hole, and in fact was a hangman who stained blood. This was introduced by Chen Lifu and Pan Gongzhan into the KMT agent organization. When he was arrested for political suspicion in 1948, when he was arrested for political suspicion, he sold out Communist Party member Li Yingcai and his brother, Communist Party member Zhang Zehao, and his brother, Communist Party member Zhang Zehao. When many revolutionary martyrs were difficult, he wrote 'Anti-Insurgency Song', 'Leader of the Holy Ming', and scoring for Chiang Kai-shek. \\nThe rampant attack by the right-wing arsonists, although at one time made a flames over the 'kingdom of heaven' and wolf fume, the wave of people's struggle against the right quickly extinguished this poisonous flame. The working-class in Chongqing and Chengdu, with a high awareness, first came up in mid-June to strike back to the right. Then, schools, agencies, small and medium-sized cities, and the vast rural areas also launched a far-flattering counter-attack against the right. With the deepening and development of the struggle, the entire front of Zhangluo Alliance Sichuan Branch has quickly collapsed. Rich and beautiful earth, after disinfection of hoe grass, there will be more abundant harvest! (People's Daily 1957.8.30)\\n"},

Many right-wing elements have pleaded guilty, and organizations at all levels are triumphing. \\nSichuan is one of the main 'strongholds' of Zhangluo Group. The small right-wing group headed by Pan dakui, a member of the NLD Central Committee and chairman of Sichuan Province, including his left and right two shells-Zhao Yiming, Deputy Secretary General of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the NLD, and Zhang Songtao, secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Committee and Chengdu Municipal Committee secretary, held that the Sichuan Alliance organized a rampant offensive against the production party. In connection with a group of minions, they publicized and resolutely implemented the reactionary political platform of the Zhangluo Alliance and proposed the local political design institute programme. They also sent people to all grass-roots levels to ignition, actively implement Zhang Luo's 'big development' policy, and advocate that people join the Union without asking for political conditions. Under their influence, Chongqing and some counties have developed a group of allies with historical political problems or consistent dissatisfaction with the producer party. \\nAs the struggle deepened, from July onwards, many new right-wing elements have been revealed in institutions, colleges and small and medium-sized cities at all levels. For example, members of the NLD Central Committee, Sichuan Vice Governor Luo Zhongxin, member of the NLD Provincial Committee, Deputy Director of the Department of Justice Zhang Xueyan, and the deputy director of the library of Sichuan Province, Muzibo, etc. They have consistently resented the Communist Party, using various occasions to attack the Communist Party. They also regularly engage in small group activities within the coalition, pulling behind and cracking down on the leftist. They are members of the intangible organization of the Pan dakui Group, according to the many reveled facts. \\nIn the colleges that began earlier in the struggle, the ugly faces of right-wing elements were more thoroughly exposed. For example, Zeng Shufan, Vice Dean of Sichuan University of Finance and Economics, Zhang Maosheng, head of Chinese Department of Sichuan University, Zhang Zehou, Professor of Sichuan Agricultural College, and Yang Zhinong, Professor of Sichuan Agricultural College. These right-wing elements viciously attacked the party committee system during the whole wind, saying that the party committee could not lead schools, and some even incited students to trouble in an attempt to create greater democracy. For example, the incident of a student strike petition in Sichuan Agricultural College due to the relocation issue was instigated by right-wing activists, Yang Zhinong and others. \\nAfter mid-July, the faces of right-wing elements of NLD organizations in various small, medium and small cities have also been revealed. Among them are Liu Shiyi in Neijiang, Zhang Jianbo in Xichang, Shengze Rong of Leshan, Zhang Morson in Nanchong, etc. They are all heads of local NLD organizations, and many have been trained in the 'NLD In-Service Cadre Training Course' organized by Pan dakui to train the backbone of fire, and resolutely implement Pan dakui's conspiracy instructions in small and medium-sized cities. Sheng Ze-rong convened 22 symposiums in Leshan County's middle schools and literary circles in the 'Great Ming Enlarged', and carried out a rampant attack against the producing party. \\nWhen the ugly faces of these right-wing elements were revealed, awareness among the masses has increased. Both the leftists and the middle elements of the Allied were actively involved in the struggle. Some people write written material overnight to reveal the words and deeds of right-wing elements, while others rushed to the city from afar to attend meetings to expose right-wing elements. When struggles for right-wing Korean language, Mianyang cadres from Chengdu hundreds of miles away from Chengdu also came to participate, making Korean pawn incapable of cunning. After the struggle, the positive attitude of the coalition groups everywhere has risen, and the right-wing elements have been isolated. NLD organizations in many schools and institutions have a close relationship with the production party organizations. Many say that they have received a deep education in the campaign. \\nAt present, Zhangluo Group Sichuan branch has initially collapsed and the movement is turning deep. Rightists have also begun to polarize and account for the activities of some intangible organizations. But some people are still watching and do not want to be fully accountable. The NLD provincial leadership team is working on steps to prepare for further efforts. \\n"},

A strong anti-right army, with the support of workers and farmers across the province, has revealed many right-wing elements from democratic parties, departments of all walks of life, provincial and local institutions, colleges, central and provincial offices, large factories and mines and secondary school teachers. \\nIn this difficult struggle, the decisive battle is the siege of Zhangluo Alliance Sichuan branch. The right leadership core of the NLD led by Pan dakui and its total seven or eight small groups, stretching out many black lines to connect right-wing members of the grass-roots organizations. They also extend their tentacles to all aspects of the outside of the Union, to reach out to the right in the Democratic Party's non-partisan and social intellectuals, leading up and down Become a black army camp, respond to each other and launch an attack against the party. As a result of the counter-attack, first concentrated on the small core group of the intangible organization that defeated the center-right group of the NLD center-right group, and then further put the right in the leadership structures of the provincial and municipal democratic party, such as Li Zixiang of Minger, Wu Fei Bai, Qiu Shuang, Deng Mingshu, Guo Zhongheng, Zhang Mingpan, Jiang Xuan of the People's Democratic Party, Lin of Minjian Quan Nine, Huang Xianzhang, Li Zhongping, Zhong Yunhe, Minjin Fan Yingshi, Non-Party Happy Ya, etc. At the same time, departments such as literature, art, reproduction of news, health, culture, education, industry, politics and law, finance and other departments also pulled out a large number of right-wing elements to pull out the outlying strongholds of right-wing groups such as 'Baihua Poetry Society' and 'Chengdu Women's Control Association'. As the struggle deepened, the right wing Wen Tian Feng, Fan Shuomer, Bai Hang, Chen Xinyi, Wang Tingquan, and others hidden in the party were also exposed. In the first phase of the fight, the timely crushing of the right-wing leadership backbone anti-people conspiracy against the people, thus breaking the ridge of the reactionary group across the province and completely isolating the right-wing elements. \\nThe right camp in Sichuan can quickly defeat, first of all because of the internal and external clamping, going up and down, and breaking the weakness of the right-wing camp first. Pan dakui group deployed fire in colleges and many small and medium-sized cities before May. As a result, the anti-right struggle began at the very beginning of the NLD grass-roots organization. The initial unveil of right-wing conspiracy activities in Ya'an, Neijiang, Nanchong and other places has facilitated the siege of the core of the provincial right leadership. The exposure of Zhao Yiming and Shu Jun's 'Local Design Plan' and 'Ten Point Fire Instructions' have further contributed to the further development of the struggle. Secondly, the active participation of the vast majority of workers and farmers in the struggle is of great significance for victory. The working-class in Chongqing and Chengdu, which was the pioneer of the struggle, came up to fight back to the right, and they used the big print newspaper to support students in a rational struggle. Farmers in Jintang and Qingshen County also directly provided right-wing criminal materials to help authorities schools expose the backbone of the right. The people of Ya'an have used their own just actions to crush the provocations of the right. The whole side change is a huge driving force to launch the masses to deepen the anti-right struggle. Schools and enterprises in provincial and municipal institutions have generally made improvements in welfare wage levels and the lack of depth in leadership style. Eighteen enterprises in Chengdu city, in the opinion of the public, have solved more than 700. If the Chengdu material factory, by solving 19 of the most pressing problems in a timely manner, inspire the masses to educate the masses, it will quickly put the watched middlemen into the struggle, exposing the right-wing Chen Qi-wu. As the movement always upholds the truth, the right-wing words and deeds have been completely refuted and exposed. Overcoming affectionism, preventing simple and rough practices, strictly differentiating boundaries and realistically dividing the right is a guarantee of healthy exercise. Such as Leshan area through inspection, re-queuing, timely correction of bias. \\nAfter this period of struggle, the province's right-wing camp has been divided and disintegrated and began to lay down their weapons, but many of the right have not yet completely surrendered to account. More difficult struggles are still ahead, and the struggle is deepening at the grass-roots level.

In the past 10 days, at the Sichuan Provincial People's Congress and at the colloquium of the Sichuan Provincial Committee and the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the NLD, after exposing and criticizing by deputies, allies and the masses, the vast majority of the members of this right-wing group had to admit their crimes against communist socialism and said to bow their heads. Confession. \\nThe Pan dakui right group was the main organizer and commander of right-wing attacks on the Communist Party by right-wing elements across Sichuan this time. The head of the right-wing group is Pan dakui, chairman of the Sichuan Province, and NLD Central Committee members Fan Puzai and Zhang Zhihe; Xin Ying is their representative in Beijing; the core elements of the group are Zhao Yiming, Deputy Secretary General of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the NLD; Zhang Songtao and Li Kang and Shu Jun in Chongqing; the group's backbone elements are Han Wenqi, Liu Kunnan, Luo Zhongxin, Zeng Shufan, Zhang Xue Rock, Hu Kelin, Feng Kexi. There are Zhang Statement, Yang Shanfu, Yang Dagang, Yang Junming and Jiang Wenqin, the group's small group elements within the NLD and organs. The group's agents at the grass-roots level are Luo Xiling, Yang Zhinong, Liu Shiyi, Zhang Maosheng, Xing Shitong, Huang Dacheng, Zhang Zehou, Zhang Yongyan and others. \\nIt was revealed that under the direct arrangement of Zhangluo Union, Pan dakui and other members of the alliance and the intellectuals involved in a series of incitement work. Pan dakui, Zhao Yiming, Zhang Songtao and others have gathered the right-wing elements of the city and county alliance Zhang Mosheng, Liu Shiyi and Luo Xiling to secretly convey Zhang Luo's estimate of the situation and purpose and demand. Pan dakui, Zhao Yiming and others once said: 'The Communist Party is still afraid of strikes or strikes, and there is no fear of crackdown with the army. The show can still be revolved, intellectuals get up, and the Communist Party can make concessions.' \\n'In the future, the status of a democratic party will change, and can propose candidates for prime minister, deputy prime minister, minister and deputy minister.' \\nPan dakui also instructed these right-wing elements to go back to 'put' 'bicameral system', 'political design institute', 'rehabilitation', 'party world', 'party government', 'party government', 'school party committee system', and so on, and famously incited, 'This is what you want!' After a series of ideas and organization deployment, the backbone elements of the Pandakui group went down to the grass-roots level to launch a rampant attack on the Communist Party against socialism. This 'fire' burned from Chengdu and Chongqing, and has been burned to Ya'an, Nanchong, Neijiang, Zigong, Luzhou, Yibin, Mianyang, Suining, Xichang and other cities and counties; this 'fire' burned into higher schools, government agencies, secondary schools, primary schools, literary institutions and other departments and social intellectuals. With the initiative of Pan dakui and Zhao Yiming, Yang Zhinong, a right-wing member of the Sichuan Agricultural College and a member of the NLD branch department, have created so-called 'relocation problems', inciting students from the Agricultural College, monitoring the deputy president of the Communist Party members, seizing and interrogating the working cadres of the CPC Ya'an Land Committee, and beating those who went to know the situation The secretary of the Communist Party Committee of the Communist Party of Ya'an and the President of the People's Court of Ya'an city; at the same time, they shouted 'against the supreme organ Reactionary slogan, gathered around Ya'an station, trying to get to Chengdu. \\nThe material revealed shows that Pan dakui Group organizes its activities in a public set, as well as a secret set. What is public is the use of legal forms to carry out illegal activities. For example, the meetings of NLD were used to convey the private goods of Jangro Union; to use various contacts at work to follow up their reactionary claims; and use the promotion of cadres to secure some and crowd out some. The secret is to organize activities in tandem through private contacts. They often use contacts in daily life such as visiting friends, drinking tea, food, watching games and mountain tours to talk about 'private words'. For example, in Chengdu there are so-called 'Wenshu Monastery Tea Party', 'Wuhou Temple Outing', 'Wuyi Lane Conference'; in Chongqing there are so-called 'South Spring Talks', 'Western Suburban Park Meeting' and so on. They even set up fixed 'tea parties', 'dinners', 'transfers', etc., as organizers and contacts. They also took the form of 'meeting friends', such as teaching, literary, painting, old poetry, etc., to contact some smelling intellectuals. They use these activities to spread anti-communist ideas, exchange anti-Communist intelligence and plan anti-communist conspiracies against communist anti-socialism. Their demand for the Development Alliance is 'the more the better, the faster the better.' After these conspiracies were revealed by the masses, most of the right-wing group were forced to bow down to confess guilt, and some continued to confess. At this point, the 'stronghold' of the Zhangluo Union, the Pandakui right-wing group, collapsed, and the whole line collapsed. \\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attachment 3] Feng Kexi: 'All life is right to talk about it is not-Mr. Yi Pan dakui'\\nNearly 10 years have passed away from Mr. Pan dakui. I've always wanted to write something to express my thoughts about this teacher and elder who I followed for half a century, but I'm always confused about how to write? How can I write? Recently, the party called for politics and integrity, which makes me think of Mr. Pan dakui, who has a full life of good faith and avid. \\nHuman dignity lies in thought\\nMr. Pan studied political science, graduated from Tsinghua University in the 1920s, studied in the United States, returned to teach in Shanghai. At the same time, participate in the National Salvation Council and participate in the democratic revolution. The anti-Japanese war began, he went to Kunming and actively engaged in the rescue campaign. The 'China Democratic League' was established. He was the first Central Committee member, together with Chutunan, Wu Han, Wen Yiduo, Li Gongpu and Pan Guangdan in Kunming to organize 'democracy, anti-dictatorship, anti-Japanese resistance and anti-civil war' activities in Kunming. At the end of the war of resistance, he went to Chongqing University to teach while participating in the 'National Salvation Council', participated in the democratic revolution and led the Chongqing NLD. At that time, autocracy was rampant and corruption prevailed. He said to us, 'The people have a bitterness, and morale will be destroyed. This is the characteristic of authoritarianism, and we are going to do the opposite.' This has become a belief in his leadership of everyone's struggle with the reactionaries-to strive for democracy, resist autocracy, defend civilization and fight darkness. It is a trend of thought set forth by Chinese people in the past 100 years under the germination of justice and conscience. It is a windmill of history that has been manifested by deeds, and this is an understanding of China's recent progress. Cheng's people will admit an historical fact. \\nAt the end of 1949, when the Kuomintang lost Chongqing, it created a slag cave massacre that shook the country. There are more than twenty comrades killed by the NLD. At the beginning of liberation, we organized a heavy memorial service for martyrs. Step out of the venue, Mr. Pan said to me, 'We are survivors. The responsibility of the survivors is to cherish it.' I asked, 'What should I cherish?' 'Democracy, justice, ideals,' he said. It seems that this is the value he pursues throughout his life. In fact, this should also be the heart of every troubled Chinese intellectuator. He said to me more than once, 'I don't have a great skill, but one thing is right. I firmly believe in democracy, I firmly believe that democracy will progress, and democracy is the trend.' He also often emphasizes: reading, unification of people, unity of thought and character. \\nThis is supposed to be a respectable place for intellectuals, unfortunately, too often. Mr. Pan's heart is fast, reflecting full book angry. His idealism is strong, but he is a 'political activist' who studies politics but does not understand 'politics'. This inevitably leads to the fate of 'subordination must be the right, it is inevitable.' In the early 1950s, he was dissatisfied with some 'left' practices within the NLD. When 'against the right,' it ends up in a catastrophe. \\nMr. Pan became the 'southwest chief' of the 'Zhang (Burjun), Luo (Longji), anti-party alliance', and several of our young people who followed him have naturally become the 'generals' of this 'alliance'. But what exactly is the organization, program, and plan of this 'organized, planned' 'anti-party alliance'? I do not think about it. After a 'struggle', I could not help but write a letter to Mr. Pan, who was also struggling with 'struggles' in Chengdu, asking him, 'What exactly is this going on?' Can't think, a few days later, get his reply, simple and clear write a few words to reply to me: 'No need!' He had the courage to write this, but I did not have the courage to keep this letter. And Mr. Pan, disregarding the waves of wind, stick to his faith, maintain a unique style of ethics, why not be reassuring! \\nAfter that, he was cut back to work, and I devolved my labor. For nearly a decade, isolated from each other. My remembrance of this elder is always or always. Every time an acquaintance goes to Chengdu, always bring him a greeting. He also occasionally added words to encourage me: to face history, stand high, not lose faith. \\n'Cultural Revolution' chaos, Chongqing wudou days. To take refuge, I went to Chengdu. The first thing was to see Mr. Pan. Knocking off a withered hut in Salt Road Street, and he was excited to speak with my hand. He left me to live with him. On those sleepless nights, we talked about ten years of disillusion and all sorts of time. He talked about the late 'anti-right', who has been rained in the years, he was 'ordered' to pull the board truck, to walk more than a dozen miles a day. At the beginning of the 'Cultural Revolution', listed tour street, other 'reactionaries' hanging a piece, he hung two pieces. 'This also did not crush my waist!' On the day he broke up, he sent me out, saying, 'We can have nothing, but have thought; moreover, we should be stubborn to our own mind. Human dignity lies in thought. Thoughts are a candlelight that people understand the world, and a pillar of life. Without thought, people will have their name without the truth.' \\nHe pointed to the Red Guards outside the window and the procession who called the sky slogans, and said to me, 'Look, we have reached a crazy era, a liar world.' But people should always be sincere, to tell the truth.' I said, 'Now tell the truth, why is it easy to talk? There is a reward for lying, telling the truth unlucky. Some people themselves do not speak the truth, nor are others allowed to speak the truth, and use this day, earning, invitations and advancement.' 'Hypocrisy is a deep poison to the spirit,' he said. Social sincerity is less, more evil, hope is bleak.' \\n'Right' often does not necessarily have to be honest\\n'Cultural Revolution' in the past, whatsoever, everyone will see every day. Mr. Pan resumed his post as vice-chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, and I also worked for the Chongqing municipal government. When we met, we talked about the experiences of countries and individuals in these years, and felt a lot. 'Look at history and sober to reality,' he said. Unfortunately, I ignored the old man's warning, and in 1988, after the NLD 'Yantai Conference', I was named again. Then, he was called to 'inspect' at the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the NLD. I went to Chengdu and didn't go to see Mr. Pan. The old man knows, ask me. Why don't you see him? I said, 'Fear makes you worry again.' He asked, 'What the hell is going on in Yantai?' I said, 'It was an alliance seminar with organized leadership, so that everyone would like to speak freely, and we would like to talk about it. There may be individual bias, but I think it's all starting from the IPU, and there is no other intention.' He said: 'The knowledge is to know, it should stick to it. I'm still the old saying: 'Be honest, have character. ''-After the NLD 'Six', 'Yantai' smoke has passed. That winter, I went to Jinan via Beijing for a meeting. Comrade from the NLD Central Committee asked me to eat. Comrade Gao Tien was more comforted. I wrote to Pan Lao about these cases and reassured him. He replied to me, 'I always read the words of Zhuang Zi: 'The world's reputation is not exhorted, and the world is ruined without hindrance. ' I may not be right, but these years, we also don't forget a humor: 'right' often doesn't necessarily be honest.'-This reminds me of how many 'right' calls, from 'anti-right' to 'cultural revolution', who can 'move and inspire' not being a god, and what do these glorious flowers have in common with integrity and integrity? \\nAlways and honesty sincerely embrace\\nHaving heard and seeing what Mr. Pan has said and done for decades, I feel that he is truly worthy of morality and generosity; bright and honest. Only sincerity, can be full of life; only by falling, is able to clearly identify the wrong. Some say, 'People have the right to say no is valuable.' In fact, people have the courage to say no is more valuable. Of course, this 'no' is not out of intentions or prejudices, but of reason and impartiality. If people had such knowledge, some historical chapters could be rewritten, and the image of intellectuals could look another way. \\nAs Mr. Liang Shuming became a thinker, Mr. Fei said: 'In today's world, there can be a few people in intellectuals that are not only, books, superiority, and scriptures... open their thoughts without restraint to think independently.' One of the great tragedies of Chinese intellectuals is that history has failed to provide a society where rational political parties grow, emotional thinking and adaptation into the trend of the times. Thus, from one end to the other, they embody the transformation and loss, and lose the intellectual superiority and spiritual qualities that the intellectuals deserve. To sustain survival without sacrificing the value of survival. Not all around us and on ourselves can not be seen much of this trace! But life is not a single one. In our contacts, among the NLD's predecessors, there are not Ma Yin early who is 'big to just', Liang Shuming, who has 'three armies to take handsome, piff unrivalled', Pan dakui, who has 'no disdain,' and Ye Duyi, who has 'nine dead and not repentant', and some familiar gentlemen. They may have such 'paranoid' or 'lonely', and how can they comment in the Chinese cultural process? History will have public opinion, and people will have judgment. \\nSome argue that the legitimacy of intellectuals is extremely fragile if they are based solely on knowledge traditions and the adaptation of social life, and their intellectual resources will increasingly be depleted. Intellectuals cannot seal themselves in the ivory tower of spirituality, act as a moral judge 'looking over all beings', nor should they become the spiritual dwarf of the conscientious, Vino's spiritual dwarf. \\nPeople should be honest, should be sincere, should adhere to historical responsibility, and should pursue the truth of the times. These, easy to say, really have to do it, how easy to talk about? Thus, someone who can do so is more precious. This makes me think that it is no coincidence that the respect and remembrance of Mr. Pan Da-kui is not a coincidence. Ten years ago, the scene of mourning him in Chengdu was still in vain. So much mourning, so much heavy. We are not only a well-known scholar, chiefs, but also a true and upright person. How much the loss of a sincere and honest person is to society, how deep the grief of people will be! I think of the two poems of Tang Dynasty, 'No one in the world who knows the junjun', is not exactly the portrayal of Mr. Pan? \\nHistory has always built public and dignity by discernment. Standing on the historical stage, we must always be brave to distinguish from those hypocritical and ugly things in life, and always with integrity and sincere embrace. \\nOpposing dictatorship, defending civilization and fighting darkness is a trend of thought by Chinese people in the past 100 years under the germination of justice and conscience, and is reflected in action, a windmill of history. Having heard from decades, seeing what Mr. Pan dakui said and doing, I feel that he really deserves: all his life is right, and nothing is wrong. We can not have everything, but to have thought. Human dignity lies in thought. Everyone admired and remembered is not only a well-known scholar, chiefs, but also a true and upright person. \\n(The author is the former Deputy Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Democratic League, formerly Vice Mayor of Chongqing)\\nPAGE 9"}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attached】zhangyeshang: 'Wang Xiaoyu and his affairs-during the Shandong Procuratorate'\\nWang Xiaoyu and his wife, Liu Chongyu, are a political couple. Liu Chongyu originated in Yanggu, grew up in Jinan. During the anti-Japanese war and during the liberation war, it has been running its own Jiruo Primary School in Jinan and became the principal. After the liberation of Jinan, Liu Chongyu became the principal of Ji'nan Liujiazhuang Primary School and Lin Xiang Street Primary School. In 1952, he was dismissed on charges of embezzlement and corporal punishment of students. Liu Chongyu has been dissatisfied with this. Complaints to the Disciplinary Inspection Commission of Shandong Province in 1953. At that time, Wang Xiaoyu was the Director of the Disciplinary Commission, personally accepted Liu Chongyu's complaint, and gave her a pacification. The two people fell in love with each other. Later Wang Xiaoyu divorced his original wife and married Liu Chongyu. \\nFrom 1953 to 1959, Wang Xiaoyu served as deputy party secretary and first deputy attorney general at the Shandong Provincial Procuratorate. The Volkswagen Daily had specifically praised Wang Xiaoyu, calling him a 'hard, simple, spotless' cadre typical. Wang Xiaoyu's ability and talent have been admired by many people. At that time, Wang Xiaoyu can also be said to be a model of daring to stick to the truth and dare to do it. Just as Wang Xiaoyu, when he was director of the Shandong Revolutionary Committee, will say that his 'problem' is 'good poke', 'especially big courage', not afraid of power and power. At that time, the main head of Shandong had a headache for him, but there was nothing to do. His character is also very obvious in the future. \\nAfter the promulgation of the Organic Law of the People's Procuratorate in 1954, Wang Xiaoyu called on procuratorial cadres to 'study carefully', to be familiar, and take the lead in multiplying themselves to demonstrate. At the same time, Wang Xiaoyu also presided over the transfer of a large number of district and county procuratorial cadres to the provincial procuratorate to study organic law. He attached great importance to playing the supervisory role of the procuratorial organs. He had engaged in 'general supervision,' 'investigation supervision', 'trial supervision' and 'supervision of labor in prisons', which was very famous at the time. \\nDuring the anti-right struggle in 1957, the Provincial Procuratorate's Office Pan deming Deming, Liu Xinmin, Mi Xingyun, Liu Pei Xia and others were in the wind movement. Some people wanted to divide them into the right. Wang Xiaoyu, who is recovering in Qingdao, hastily returned to Jinan. When Jiang Lixin, party branch secretary of the procuratorate organ, reported to him about the anti-right struggle, Wang Xiaoyu said: 'I see no right-wing in our organs.' When the party group asked him to participate in the anti-right leadership group, he publicly refused to say, 'I don't participate in your leadership group.' Also said: 'The whole wind against the right is to engage in ideological struggle, I am most afraid of thinking struggle, and insomnia.' Since then, Wang Xiaoyu refused to participate in the anti-right struggle. When he saw Liu Xinmin's name published in the Public Daily, he was angry and immediately followed up: 'Why should Liu Xinmin report, and who approved it? You will be passive in the future!' Liu Peixia went to the provincial procurator's office in 1955 as the head of the office. He was the deputy leader of the anti-right leadership group of the Procuratorate during the winds against the right. He was very sympathetic to those who made opinions in the light. After the anti-right began, he gave advice to Pan deming Deming, Liu Xinmin, Mi Xingyun, etc., and informed the letter. The result was also revealed as the right Wang Xiaoyu was very dissatisfied with this practice. He said publicly: 'To Liu Peixia, you deal with it as an internal problem, I will expose her, as an external problem, I will not expose her.' Wang Xiaoyu team's practice of capturing other people's speeches is very disgusted. When checking materials, Wang Xiaoyu insisted that 'check the materials cannot be subordinate to the majority. Your witnesses are more opposites. Liu Pei Xia himself is an opposites. As long as he does not admit, he cannot count.' After checking the materials, Wang Xiaoyu made it clearer about the so-called right-wing remarks at the general meeting of the procuratorate, and he could not help but to drop the book. Dafabet thunder said: 'Speaking today about Liu Peixia's issue. I don't want to say, the party group told me to say, I have to speak. You have uncovered 140 articles of Liu Pei Xia. Which one is a question of principle and which one is anti-socialist?! I see you guys ate millet, nothing to do, craps! You have nothing to do. It's not good to roll the road!' \\nWhen the right party entered the stage of verification and finalization, Chen Lei made Wang Xiaoyu responsible for checking the materials. Wang Xiaoyu took this opportunity to use his authority and make every effort to protect it. In 1955, Pan deming Deming was criticized when he maintained a clerical contact with his students in Hong Kong. After the wind began to vent his dissatisfaction with the rebellion. Wang Xiaoyu publicly argued for the quality: 'The dissatisfaction is understandable.' Insisting that Pan deming Deming is not the right. Other cadres who would be classified as right were defended. Later, at the party group meeting, put forward a concluding opinion on the right of the Procuratorate: 'Something is wrong, Mi's good luck has erroneous remarks. Pan deming Deming and Liu Xinmin all have right-wing rhetoric, but none are the right.' Under Wang Xiaoyu's fight, the procuratorate, except Liu Xinmin was designated as the right, all others were freed. \\nIn 1958, Wang Xiaoyu was added on the charge of sheltering the right to the party inspectorate for two years, abolishing the post of deputy secretary of the Party of the provincial procuratorate and the first procurator, and the penalty for reducing the salary level from 10 to level 13. Several of the people he protected were also unable to escape bad luck. Pan deming Deming was designated as an anti-revolutionary and controlled; Mi Xingyun was identified as a right-wing element; Liu Peixia was identified as a class dissident; Liu Xinmin was defined as a far-right, re-education through labour. \\nLater, Wang Xiaoyu's repeated complaint, his treatment of Wang Xiaoyu in 1964 was screened, but left behind a tail of serious mistakes in the anti-right struggle and mistakes against the Central Committee.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "【Attachment 1】Yang Jisheng: 'A major mistake political event that shake the country' ('red dynasty years' 2012.7)\\nIn 1958, there was a major political event shaking the country in Henan province, namely the approval of 'Pan, Yang and Wang right-wing opposition group'. In a few months, tens of thousands of people affected by the company, killed more than 100 people, and two years later began to be rehabilitated. Pan, is Pan fusheng, First Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee and Provincial Military District Political Committee; Yang, is Yang Jue, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee; Wang, is Wang Tingdong, Deputy Secretary General of Henan Provincial Committee. \\nThe three of them were originally cadres in the Plain Province. In December 1952, Pan Fusui was transferred to Henan to serve as the first secretary of the provincial committee. Wang Tingdong accompanied Pan to Henan, in 1955 Yang Jue also transferred to Henan. \\nDivergence starts at the speed of collaboration\\nDivergence began on the issue of agricultural cooperation. \\nPan, Yang, Wang and others believe that the pace of promoting agricultural cooperation cannot be too quick, too fast, and should be carried out systematically in batches. 30% in the first year, 30% in the second year and the third year. Wu Zhipu, who was the second secretary of the provincial committee, had studied at the Peasant Movement Workshop hosted by Mao Zedong during the Revolution, and he advocated completion of one year. Three years of completion would have been central advice, and later the following development was fast, and some places were cooperative overnight. Mao Zedong is also pleased to publish the Socialist Climax in Rural China, criticizing people who advocate slower as 'little feet women'. \\nOn the scale of cooperatives, Pan, Yang and Wang believe that you cannot blindly advocate the bigger the better, it is too big to manage, while Wu Zhipu thinks that the bigger the size, the better. In the actual implementation, it began to be Hundred House, and it was developed to Chihasha. \\nWu Zhipu advocates that cooperatives should pool livestock and carry out large trough feeding. Pan, Yang and Wang Xianxiang saw that conditions for centralized feeding were not in place, management could not keep up. Livestock lingworm, hair loss, illness and death. In order to reduce livestock mortality, he advocated small trough feeding to protect livestock and guarantee agricultural production. \\nAfter cooperation, do you want to give farmers little freedom? Wu Zhipu advocates allowing farmers to engage in the collective economy wholeheartedly, and cannot fuel the tendency of small farmers to collect their own land collectively. Pan, Yang and Wang believe that the recovery of their own land has affected the motivation of farmers and prevents farmers from using their spare time to engage in family side jobs, affecting farmers' incomes. \\nSince the cooperative movement develops too quickly, too quickly, and the work is too rough, there have been forced orders and illegal practices in the work, resulting in strong resistance among farmers. Between the second half of 1956 and the first quarter of 1957, there was an incident in rural Henan province. Linru County in the second half of 1956 in 31 agricultural societies 'mischief' events; Shangqiu area from December 1956 to January 1957, 130 senior societies and 40 primary societies had a mass 'miscarriage'. In the 'mayhem', some farmers pulled back their own livestock from the big trough of the collective, some peasants demanded to leave the community, and in some places farmers clashed with cadres who had made forced orders. In dealing with the incident, a number of those who had led the incident were arrested and sentenced. In the education campaign to publicize the superiority of cooperation carried out before and after the 1957 Chinese New Year, serious brutal treatment of the masses occurred. Many people were tied up, routed, criticized, controlled and even destroyed to death. \\nIn July 1954, Pan recuperation due to illness and recuperation, was temporarily chaired by Wu Zhipu. Pan regeneration restores work after health improves and proceeds to correct deviations when Wu presided over the job. He asked Yang Jue to visit Xuchang, Nanyang, Pingdingshan and sent Wang Tingdong to Anyang field investigation. On the basis of the study, the 'Advocacy points on incentives for the development of agricultural production for the autumn harvest' were developed. A total of more than 8 articles 40 of the 'Propaganda Points' deal with all aspects of consolidating the collective economy and safeguarding the interests of farmers, for example, promoting livestock feeding and feeding integration; allowing members to raise their own livestock in order to meet the needs of family by-workers production, and to use social members' livestock reasonable scores; The grain left in the property is delivered only to the public grain, not counted for the acquisition task; agricultural cooperatives must implement contracted production, overproduction incentives ; farmers can raise their own chickens, pigs; allow social members to reclaim clearance land, houses before and after the small wasteland, can also engage in family side businesses; open the free market; cooperative size is too large, according to the requirements of social members, can be divided into smaller, and so on. \\nAfter Pan Recovery presided over the work, he also presided over the 'Instructions on Conducting the Breeze Movement and Correctly Handling Inconsistencies within the People'. According to this document, the forced orders and illegal acts of civil rights, Xiayi and Yongcheng cadres in cooperation have been seriously investigated and punished, and the incidents of peasant rallies in Linru County were reprocessed. Some of the arrested persons were released. \\nPan revived learned that some farmers in Yichuan and Linru eat 'Guanyin soil', their heart was very heavy, and asked the province to solve it immediately, and reported that the central government hopes to lower the acquisition index and leave a little more to farmers. Wang Tingdong was in charge of the general purchase and sale of grain in the province. Pan Fusuo sent him to investigate the situation of grain acquisition. He found that the rations left for farmers were too few, and more were sweet potatoes, and they rot away if they were not well preserved. After reporting to the provincial committee, he advocated that farmers should be given one pound of rations a day. Sweet potatoes changed from 4 pounds and 1 kg to 5 kg off 1 kg of grain, only the team of more than 380 pounds per capita to buy surplus grain. \\nIn April 1958, in Luanping County, Henan Province, the first people's commune appeared. Not a long time, many places realized people's communism overnight. Xiuwu County proposed to achieve communism for four years, a unit of economic accounting throughout the county. Farmers all implement the wage system, and monthly wages (in fact, cannot be issued for a month.). There is also a great deal in various places, violating the interests of farmers. Pan, Yang and Wang also have different views on these. \\nAt that time, the bigger the commune canteens, several villages run a canteen, several villages to eat a place to eat and take a few miles to eat a meal. Too many people, long lines of meals. Pan, Yang, Wang advocate that the canteen do a little smaller. Wu Zhipu and others believe that the cafeteria has ten advantages, one of which is that cooking mechanization can be achieved. Wu Zhipu reported to Mao Zedong his achievements in cooking mechanization, and Mao asked to move these cooking machinery to the Lushan conference for exhibition. Comrades in other provinces looked at not believing. In fact, these wooden cooking machinery does not technically pass, can not be used. After the Lushan meeting, Deng Xiaoping passed through Zhengzhou to visit the cafeteria mechanized, they moved the wooden cooking machinery from the provincial exhibition hall to Zhengzhou suburb crow Chen village, let the provincial women's federations dispose as farmers to explain. \\nList of 'eight counts', removal from office\\nIn the fight against the right, the CPC Henan Provincial Committee began to criticize Pan's recovery. In August 1957, the Fifth Plenary Session of the Provincial Committee (enlarged), accused Pan Recovery to preside over the development of 'the promotion points on incentives for the development of agricultural production and for the autumn harvest' as a platform for the development of capitalism. The Plenary decided to discontinue the promotion and implementation of the Promotional Elements. This time it also decided to immediately withdraw the directive issued by the Henan Provincial Committee in July 1957 on not carrying out anti-right struggles at the county level. It considered that this document made a false estimate of the situation of class struggle, totally contrary to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and contravened the Marxists' doctrine of class struggle. \\nIn May 1958, the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held. Wu Zhipu, second secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee, made a speech entitled 'Right-leaning opportunism is the main danger in the current party' and criticized Pan's recovery by name. In his speech, he 'exposes' the 'evil consequences' of Pan's revival, saying: 'The mistake of Pan's revival is very serious, a serious right-leaning opportunity and revisionism. The victory of Henan's struggle against his wrong ideas is the victory of adhering to the path of socialism and a turning point in Henan's work from passive to active.' Mao Zedong praised Wu Zhipu's speech. In his speech at the Second Session of the Eighth Congress, Mao Zedong named and criticized a number of people, including Pan Recovery. From May 18 to 20, the Henan group who participated in the second session of the Eighth Congress pulled the sick Pan's recovery from the hospital to the meeting, and criticized him for three and a half days in a row. On May 18 (during the meeting), the CPC Central Committee informed the Henan Provincial Committee that Pan fusheng was removed from the post of First Secretary of Henan Provincial Committee and replaced by Wu Zhipu. \\nWu Zhipu called the Provincial Committee at the Second Meeting of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, so that he could quickly prepare the materials for criticism of Pan From June 6 to July 1, 1958, the ninth general enlargement meeting of Henan Province of the Communist Party of China was held. The theme was to convey the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, which focused on criticizing Pan, Yang and Wang's 'right-wing opportunity mistakes'. Eight counts were given to Pan, Yang and Wang at this meeting:\\nFirst, denying class struggles, denying two road struggles, creating 'class struggle extinguishing theory'; second, attacking cooperation, negating the superiority of cooperation, promoting 'the theory of economic superiority of small farmers'; third, attacking and attempting to abolish the policy of food purchase and sales, oppose criticism of spontaneous forces; and the bourgeoisie right echoed inside and outside, rampant attacks against the party; five, in the garment of leading the anti-right struggle, Striving to obstruct and disrupt the anti-right struggle; Six, insist on issuing a platform for development capitalism; 7, deceiving the central central and central authorities in confrontation with the correct line (mainly refers to the revival of Pan's rebirth to reflect the real situation in Henan in July 1957, was described as 'a mess' of Henan's work); Involve into an opposition faction and carry out the partisan conspiracy. \\nThe meeting held that they fully formed 'an anti-socialist sectarian group of anti-socialist groups' and that the nature of their struggle with them 'is a two-class, two-way struggle, a struggle to adhere to the right line of the Central Committee and the struggle against, distortion and revision of the central route'. \\nThe meeting recommended and submitted to the Central Committee for approval to abolish the functions of the Standing Committee of the Pan Recovery Provincial Committee and the Military District Political Committee; abolish Yang Jue Provincial Committee Secretary and Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee; and abolish the post of deputy secretary general of the Wangtingdong Provincial Committee. The CPC Central Committee quickly approved the Henan Provincial Committee's proposal to deal with Pan, Yang and Wang. The meeting issued a resolution on the complete criticism of the 'anti-party group' led by the revival of Pan. \\nA massive campaign of approval\\nAfter the second meeting of the Eighth National Congress, the Central Secretariat convened the leaders of the provincial committee including Wu Zhipu, Yang Weiping and Yang Jue from Henan to attend the meeting. The meeting was presided over by Deng Xiaoping, Peng Zhen, Li Xuefeng and Liu Lantao. Deng Xiaoping said that criticism of Pan's recovery can only be carried out within the Party and cannot be extended to society. However, once he returned to the province, Wu Zhipu could not wait to carry out a great criticism of society as a whole. \\nAfter the ninth plenary meeting of the Provincial Committee, in urban and rural areas of the province, and outside the party party launched a political campaign 'Pan, Yang, Wang', 'Put red flags, pull white flags'. He said it was 'a remedial lesson in the fight against the right and the continuation of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts'. \\nThe movement is huge. The Henan Daily publishes lengthy, critical articles and news reports on the progress of the movement every day. The first, two and three issues of the new provincial committee and organs publication 'Zhongzhou Review' became a special number critical of 'Pan, Yang, Wang'. Radio stations continue to place the names of 'Pan, Yang, Wang', counting their 'counts'. All over the province are filled with slogan criticizing 'Pan, Yang, Wang', and their cartoons, and theatrical shows criticizing 'Pan, Yang and Wang' on stage. \\nPan, Yang and Wang suffered a brutal struggle. At the ninth plenary meeting of the provincial committee, the sick Pan revival was 'pulled' to the meeting to accept criticism. Pan, Yang, Wang three doors with white black words 'Panjia Black Shop' banner. All windows and doors were smashed, and the house was filled with large print newspapers. \\nThe result of the treatment of the three of them is: Pan fusheng devolved to Xihua Farm as deputy director; Yang Jue reduced from level 8 to level 11, delegated to Luoyang area Mengjin County flood commune Han Liang brigade members; Wang Tingdong from level 9 to level 12, after public batching in the province, sent directly to the Sun Temple Commune of Xiangxian County, Xuchang area Liulin production team, let him be here for three years. \\nWrong criticism has serious consequences\\nThe left-leaning ideology of Henan Province was originally more serious. In the fight against the right, the province had drawn 60,000 right-wing elements, ranking the top of all provinces in the country. After criticizing the 'Pan Yang Wang opposition group', no one dared to tell the truth in the party and cadres. \\nWu Zhipu's long text entitled 'The Philosophy of Leap Forward, Leap Forward of Philosophy' was published in the 'Review of Zhongzhou' sponsored by the Provincial Committee to further develop subjective mentalism. Batch of truth struggles to escalate, fake fashion with the upgrade. Please see the report of the People's Daily: June 8, Henan Suanping Satellite Commune 5 acres of wheat average production of 2015 kg; June 12, Henan Suanping Satellite Commune production of 3530 kg; June 15, the first edition of the headline title 'Harvest Kaige millions of people laughing', the theme 'Henan wheat yield leap 'More than doubled', subtopic 'view of the tide' 'accounting' should be timely and sobering. June 18, Henan Shangqiu Shuanglou commune, mu production of 4412 pounds of wheat; June 21, Huixian Grange commune, mu production of 4535 kg of wheat; July 12, Henan Xiping, mu wheat 7320 pounds; September 13, Henan province average rice kilograms, become kilograms province... Put the 'satellite' and the People's Daily published an editorial of 'I wish Henan Grand Jie'. 'Henan Province, which once ranked among the top wheat production, is also a red flag for national steel production.' Wu Zhipu, a hot mind, proposed a year to achieve water conservancy, mechanization, seed, greening and other 'ten'. \\nHenan has become the country's 'advanced province', and there are a large number of people from all over the country to visit and study in Henan. The People's Daily regularly reports 'advanced deeds' in Henan, and some people in Henan have also 'cattle' up, and they do not see people coming from the central ministries. Central Minister of Industry Gao Yang went to Yuxian, Henan, to put forward his opinion on the quality of iron making in small blast furnace. The county leaders said that Gao Yang had thrown cold water to the masses movement and criticized Gao Yang on the spot, and transferred the materials to Beijing, and Gao Yang was also criticized after returning to Beijing. Yang Xianzhen, Vice President of the Central Party School, went to Henan Province to see the slogan 'How bold people are and how productive the land is', raised different opinions. He also received criticism in Henan and was criticized after returning to Beijing. Zou Lufeng, Vice President of Renmin University of China, expressed different views on Henan's practices, and was also criticized in Henan. Beijing cadres have never dare to go to Henan. \\nIn 1958, Henan province grain production was actually only 28.1 billion pounds, but exaggerated to 70.2 billion pounds. In 1959, there was a drought in Henan, and grain production fell to 19.49 billion pounds, and exaggerated to 45 billion pounds. Sadly, exaggeration is a digital game, but it leaves farmers with real consequences. Overestimating production inevitably brings high purchase, 1958 purchase of 880 billion pounds of grain, accounting for 28.7% of the actual production; 1959 acquisition of 7.2 billion pounds, plus the commune's self-raising grain and turnover, still at 8.08 billion pounds, accounting for the year's actual output 37.14%. In these two years, the province acquired more than 6 billion kilograms of grain. Farmers were forced to hand over seeds, fodder and rations for procurement tasks. As a result, a food shortage occurred shortly after the autumn harvest, with extremely serious consequences. \\nAfter the rebellion\\nThe cost of tens of thousands of lives made people wake up: Pan, Yang and Wang are right, and Wu Zhipu has carried out a great disaster. \\nFrom 1960 to 1962, the CPC Central Committee sent leaders such as Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Tan Zhenlin, Xi Zhongxun, Tao Zhu, Wang Renzhong, Wang Cong-wu, Xu Zirong, and Jin Ming to investigate and research in Henan to help solve the problem in Henan. In July 1961, the CPC Central Committee sent Liu Jianxun as the first secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee, Wu Zhipu reassigned to the secretary of the Central South Bureau, in charge of culture and education. After the summer of 1961, under the supervision of the CPC Central Committee, Henan Provincial Committee began screening and verification of Pan, Yang and Wang's issues. In April 1962, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of the Communist Party of China made a 'right-wing opportunistic error' on comrade Pan's revival resolution, the resolution said: 'The Provincial Committee since 1957 has made a serious mistake in criticizing and dealing with Comrade Pan fusheng, Yang Jue and Wang Tingdong have committed a right right chance 'The Wrong Decision' is totally wrong and should be reversed.' On July 30 and December 20, Henan Provincial Committee gave Yang Jue and Wang Tingdung Ping respectively to restore their original duties and salary levels. \\nAfter Liu Jianxun, He Wei, Wen Minsheng and Yang Jue presided over the work in Henan Province, they did a lot of rehabilitation work, and the situation in Henan began to improve. (In order to write this article, Yang Jue Old and Ji Yu Lao received the author's interview three times, and revised the manuscript. Comrade Wang Tingdong sent his handwritten memories from Shanxi, and revised the manuscript.

In addition to provincial committee members and alternate members, there are also local, municipal committee secretaries, deputy ministers of provincial committee, provincial party groups, party committees responsible for a total of 121 people. First of all, Comrade Wu Zhipu, secretary of the provincial committee, conveyed Chairman Mao's speech at the Second Session of the Eighth Congress and the report of Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping and Tan Zhenlin. In the course of studying and discussing the documents of the Second Conference of the Eighth Congress, the criticism of Pan fusheng (former first secretary of the provincial committee), Yang Jue (secretary of the Provincial Committee), Wang Tingdong (provincial committee repair committee, deputy secretary general of the provincial committee), anti-socialist remarks and deeds. In the face of the fact of iron, Pan fusheng, Yang Jue and Wang Tingdong made initial representations about their anti-party actions and conspiracy activities. Finally, the meeting discussed and deployed future work. \\nIn the course of the meeting, the news of the unprecedented harvest of summer crops and new inventions on the industrial and financial trade fronts was greatly encouraged by comrades at the meeting, and strengthened confidence in implementing the Party's overall socialist construction line and striving for a greater harvest. \\nThe meeting was a meeting of a sharp two-way struggle. It was also a meeting to strengthen the unity of the party. \\nComrade Wu Zhipu, in conveying the resolutions of the Second Conference of the Eighth Congress, first gave a detailed explanation on the great significance of the Second Session of the Eighth Congress and the major issues resolved by the meeting. He said that the Second Conference of the Eighth Congress is a meeting of great historical significance in the history of the Chinese revolution and a conference of great international significance. The issues resolved at this meeting are of decisive significance to China's socialist construction. Comrade Wu Zhipu said that the conference set the overall line of socialist construction, which was a creative development of Marxism. The overall route is our platform for building socialism, the overall line of the whole party and the overall route of the people of the country. We, the whole party in Henan and the people of the province, should unite to fight for this overall route. Comrade Wu Zhipu said that the second session of the Eighth Congress adopted a 'resolution on the meeting of representatives of the Communist Party and Workers' Party in Moscow,' upholding the two declarations adopted by the meeting of representatives of the Communist Party and Workers' Party of Socialist States and the 64 Communist Party and Workers' Party representatives. Comrade Wu Zhipu further explained the international situation in which Dongfeng continues to overwhelm the westerly wind. He said: the current international class struggle is fierce and very sharp. Under such circumstances, imperialism wants to save his destiny, want to make dying struggles, in addition to creating international tension and making kinds of war provocation and preparation to Outside, his main method is to find its agent inside the socialist camp, this agent, that is, dressed The revisionists of Marxist-Leninist outfits, when socialist forces dominate internationally, the greatest danger of the international communist movement is revisionism. Comrade Wu Zhipu said that the National Agricultural Development Programme was basically adopted at the meeting: this program is one of the most significant measures in the history of China's socialist construction. In the case of China, agriculture must be vigorously developed before the material foundation can be laid for rapid industrial development. If socialist construction is to be carried out in China, it is necessary to realize the agricultural development agenda ahead of time. Finally, Comrade Wu Zhipu said: The second meeting of the 'eight congresses' is also a serious meeting, at which the right-wing activists, localists, nationalists, right-wing opportunists lurking in the party were exposed, and had a serious struggle with them. This is the party's ideology and organization On the triumph. In this way, the overall party's understanding of the overall line has become clearer, and the confidence and courage of the whole party to build socialism has been strengthened. \\nAfter explaining the significance of the second session of the Eighth Congress, Comrade Wu Zhipu called on everyone to study the documents of the meeting seriously and seriously turn the Party's resolutions into practical actions of our whole party. Then he conveyed Chairman Mao's speech, the report of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping and Tan Zhenlin. Comrades here were very excited and encouraged, unanimously expressed their warm support for the resolutions of the Second Session of the Eighth Congress and resolutely implemented; agreed that the overall line of building socialism set out at the Second Session of the Eighth Congress is of decisive significance for accelerating the socialist construction in our country, and has significant significance. International significance. In his speech, comrades enumerated the fact that Henan's 'saddle-shaped' development since 1956, especially the fact that the unprecedented harvest of crops this summer has more than doubled, fully demonstrating the correctness of the Party's overall line. According to the specific situation in Henan, everyone also deeply appreciate the need to implement the Party's masses and class lines. When implementing the Party's general line of socialist construction, the main contradictions of the transition period must not be ignored, and the struggle must be carried out on two roads. After studying Chairman Mao's speech, everyone has made it more clear that putting red flags, discerning the wind direction, breaking superstitions and liberating ideas are the fundamental guarantee for the implementation of the Party's overall line. Everyone agreed that the study of Marxism Leninism should be strengthened in the future, especially the hard work of Chairman Mao, so that the resolutions of the Second Session of the Eighth Congress become the practical action of the whole party and the entire people of Henan. \\nIn the process of discussing and studying the documents of the Second Conference of the Eight Congresses, the debriefing and criticism of right-wing opportunity activists such as Pan Recovery and Yang Jue were seriously carried out. \\nThe Revival Pan is a right-wing opportunist who is carrying out anti-socialist anti-socialist activities in the party in the cloak of Marxinism. Particularly in the first half of 1957, when the right of the bourgeoisie attacked socialism rampant against the party and the class struggle was very acute, Pan Recovery was colluded with Yang Jue and Wang Tingdong, echoed with the bourgeois right-wing elements, igniting the flames and rampant attacks against the party. They deny class struggles, deny two road struggles, oppose agricultural cooperation, oppose the all-inclusive food purchase and sales policy, obstruct and disrupt anti-right struggles, crack down on comrades who adhere to the right line, oppose the socialist system and major measures to build socialism; adhere to the path of capitalism, complete and The correct line of confrontation between the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao has caused great harm to the cause of the Party. \\nDenying class struggle, denying two road struggles, creating class struggle extinguishing theory\\nIn the first half of 1957, when the situation of class struggle was very acute, Pan Recovery, Yang Jue, etc., dressed in the coat of Marxism Leninism, shouted that 'the contradictions between the enemy and me have fallen, the internal contradictions of the people have become prominent and class struggles are over.' They distorted Chairman Mao's instructions 'on the correct handling of internal contradictions among the people'. In the winter of 1956, there was an anti-socialist reversal in rural areas of our province, when landowners, rich farmers, anti-revolutionaries and bad elements combined with wealthy farmers with serious capitalist ideas to incite social events in several regions. For example, after the incident occurred in Linru County, the provincial committee analyzed the situation of the struggle of the rural class, believing that the two road struggles had been sharp, and proposed to strengthen the ideological and political work of the Party and support cadres and the masses in combating the anti-socialist reversal. In accordance with this guiding idea, the provincial committee dealt with the Linyu News Agency issue. However, after the resumption of the rehabilitation work of Pan, the idea of class struggle extinguished theories, overturned the correct handling of the incident in Linru by the Provincial Committee and insisted on reprocessing. He believes that the incident in Pro Ru is purely an issue within the people and that there are no two ways to fight. At that time some comrades from the provincial committee still insisted on taking the point of view of class analysis to view the issue, and added to the Provincial Committee's 'Report to the Central Committee on Resolving the Linyu Commune Issue to the Central Committee': 'Of course, this is not to say that you can relax the vigilance of class struggles. Be vigilant in bad activities, let alone mistaken that the people can not want democratic dictatorship, but rather according to Chairman Mao's instructions, recognize The current political situation distinguishes between the contradictions and internal contradictions of the enemy and the people, separates the boundaries between the two sides, and deals with the problem in a realistic and appropriate manner.' Meanwhile, Pan revived without considering this correct opinion, erased this paragraph without permission, and greatly defamed this class analysis view at several cadre meetings. In winter 1956 and the spring of 1957, the three counties of Yongcheng, Xiayi and Civil Rights took place. At that time, landowners and wealthy farmers combined with rich peasants, fought cadres, pulled livestock, divided food and agricultural tools, and struggles on the two roads in the countryside were extremely sharp; the vast majority of rural cadres, party members and activists loyal to the socialist cause had come up to defend socialism and carry out propaganda attacks and counterattack. Landowners, rich farmers and wealthy farmers attack. Pan fusheng and Yang Jue, however, believe that this issue is also purely a problem within the people, not a two-way struggle. Not only do they support cadres and the masses in defending socialism and enthusiasm, but they blame the cadres for their bad style. The slandering of cadres is 'KMT style', 'illegal and undisciplined' and 'bad typical' across the country. As a result, party members, cadres and activists were punished in large numbers, and claimed to pursue the responsibility of the provincial committee. \\nDuring this period, Pan fusheng, Yang Jue, and Wang Tingdong fabricated a series of so-called internal contradictions among the people, denying all class contradictions and contradictions against us. They have repeatedly stressed that the main contradiction in rural areas is food, which in turn is dominated by leadership and leadership. They listed the 10 major contradictions in Henan: first, the supply of food and firewood; secondly, natural disasters and contradictions for a harvest; third, water disputes; fourth, lack of livestock power, plows and rakes; fifth, free market and national acquisitions and sales contradictions; sixth, primary and secondary school graduates and further employment Contradictions; Seventh, urban-rural relations and supply and demand; eighth, ethnic minority contradictions, many returnees demanded to leave; ninth , Party and non-party, especially with democratic parties and intellectuals; tenth, institutional contradictions, centralization and separation of powers, strips and blocks, central work and department work contradictions. What is more serious is that last summer, when the anti-right struggle across the country went on for more than a month, and rural capitalist forces took the lead, on July 9, the Xingyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a directive on launching the masses to completely expose and combat the bourgeois right-wing elements, calling on workers and farmers throughout the county. and revolutionary intellectuals criticize right-wing reactionary rhetoric against enemy arrogance and serious capitalist ideas The attack of the wealthy farmers. Obviously, this document is completely correct, and the same class struggle extinguishing theory is tat. Therefore, Pan fusheng, Yang Jue and Wang Tingdong strongly oppose the instructions of the Xingyang County Committee. They did not go through discussion by the Provincial Committee Standing Committee, and on July 13 last year issued extremely wrong instructions to party committees at all levels, severely denouncing the Xingyang County Committee. The instructions said: 'The problem of the majority of farmers taking the socialist road has basically been solved. The question of the victory and failure of the so-called two paths on the ideological front has not been resolved, that is, the question of the victory and failure of the two paths between 5 million intellectuals has not been resolved. In the instructions issued by the Xingyang County Committee, it is not appropriate to say in general terms that the issue of victory and failure of the two roads on the ideological front has not yet been resolved. That would blow the wealthy farmers, create artificial tensions in rural areas, and will also contribute to the development of forced order style.' The instructions also said: 'We must not use the Xingyang County Committee to set aside half a month for counteracting the right and combining the reactionary words and deeds of local local owners, rich farmers, and controlled elements to carry out vigorous denunciations and rebuttal practices.' In this way, they completely negated class struggles, rejected two road struggles, openly supported the reactionary flames of landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and wealthy farmers, greatly frustrated the socialist enthusiasm of cadres and masses; as far as they say, two in the middle of five million intellectuals The issue of success and failure in the road struggle remains unresolved and is nothing more than a word. \\nOppose cooperation, oppose food purchase and sale, manufacture Henan special theory, production pessimism\\nPan fusheng and Yang Jue made Henan special theory and production pessimism, and described the situation in Henan as a dark one. In many reports, they exclaimed and lamented that the basic situation in Henan was 'a large number of people, poor land, rough farming, and successive disasters', 'Peasant production sentiment is not high', 'better than in 1957' We are like 'sitting on a volcano', 'Peasants want to revolt, can not the Communist Party Leadership.' They also said that ten years could not solve the food problem. 'Cooperatives can increase production is a mystery, ten and twenty years will not mechanize' and that 'cattle cannot be restored to the status quo ante for five years'. \\nWhen the climax of high-level cooperation in 1956, Pan fusheng and Yang Jue struggled to obstruct it. After the realization of high-level cooperation, the people rejoice and quickly set off their production climax, but they cried everywhere that cooperation was messed up, 'many left problems' and needed to 'wipe his ass'. At that time, Pan's recovery was raising the disease, but he insisted on tampering with the work of the provincial committee at the first meeting of the first party congress. Suu, the original document that was the negative right leaning conservative spirit, modified into anti-impatience risked into, and announced the six major cooperation' Conviction': 'I spread waste, buy a car, eight flagpoles, radio... II, economic stagnation... three, pay attention to grain and cotton, ignore other cash crops, open watermelon. Fourth, stress more collective, take care of individuals, initiate excessive investment, even steak tombs, jewelry, engage farmers have views, nervous. Five, disaster areas... do not engage in productive disaster relief, only advanced... people displaced... Socialism does not eat. Six, digging wells dead, child casualties.' That is how he viciously cursed cooperation and stigmatized the socialist system. \\nThings did not and could not develop according to the wishes of Pan fusheng and Yang Jue. After achieving advanced cooperation, the masses relied on the superiority of cooperation to overcome the extraordinary natural disasters of 1956. Right-leaning opportunities should admit mistakes in the face of the facts, right? But Pan fusheng and Yang Jue are aimed at opposing collective ownership and opposing cooperation. How can they do not achieve their goals? So last year, taking advantage of the Party's reckoning, he had a planned, purposeful and organized attack against the Party. Pan fusheng said: 'We have fewer people in Henan, and the floods and droughts continue to occur... now it is because there are many problems in the collective ownership system. In the past, there are no things, and now things happen.' He described the superiority of propaganda cooperation as 'selling dog plaster', saying, 'Peasants are not leaving the socialist path', and in 1956 he questioned comrades from history: 'Do you say, what are the advantages of cooperation?' Comrade Shi said several articles, he immediately refuted: 'No, not enough food to eat, livestock died, did not increase production... What is the advantage?' 'Taisha is not superior, and there are more contradictions within the people,' he said. Liulin agricultural society member to talk to the president about the problem has to run more than a dozen miles, and also line up 'Taisha planted land is missing out.' They criticized the provincial committee for asserting that it was wrong to hold a big shrine, insisted on minimizing the size of the society, and actively supporting the affluent rural rural resignation. Pan revived and personally instructed the Ministry of Rural Work to draft seven ways of dissociation. The Standing Committee's discussions were rejected, but he was still unwilling to die. At the two meetings of the chief office directors of the county committee, he called Wang Tingdong for the first time to talk about the method of retirement. At the second meeting on July 17, Yang Jue gave a special lecture on the issue of retirement. He said: 'To study further problems, it has reached this stage. We are now studying the issue of retirement. Many people ask for retirement in one day...' And Pan revival is still personally out and approved the return of wealthy rural farmers. For example, on June 4, 1957, he approved the withdrawal of Wang Gou, a farmer, Li Songnian, and he instructed: 'Ask the Ministry of Rural Work to write a letter to the Songxian County Committee Rural Work Department to deal with it seriously, he asked for permission to leave and not to discriminate against the family.' Pan revived also teeth and attacked livestock concentrated feeding, saying: 'Livestock has died and productivity has regressed.' 'Our ancestors know how to feed livestock. We engage in socialism instead don't know how to feed the animals.' They blame the death of livestock entirely on cooperative, collective feeding, and they viciously slander the cooperative saying: 'Farmers were not like cattle horses, they are now like cattle horses.' 'Big scalper tied at home, cut hair in the ground.' 'The girlwife pulled rake, the womb sagged.' 'Cooperation has become human.' They forced the Taisha branch to feed the livestock scattered and distributed to the household, and the livestock that had been well-fed for eight years had been dispersed. Pan revived and said, 'Dispersed feeding, dead, the provincial committee is responsible; collective feeding, dead, you are responsible.' In this way, they fundamentally negate the superiority of cooperation. \\nPan fusheng, Yang Jue and Wang Tingdong also attacked and attempted to cancel the general purchase and sales policy of grain. In 1953, when the Central Committee was preparing to implement the general purchase and sale policy of food, he sought the advice of the provincial committee, Pan Recovery advocated a postponement for one year. After the central government had decided to implement the general purchase and sales policy of food, Pan revived still opposed, saying what 'iron plate nailed, I decided to implement it, but I have opinions.' In the overall purchase and sales work, he is not allowed to criticize the spontaneous forces of capitalism and obstruct the food acquisition work. 'The purchase is like a rope, tied to the farmer's neck.' In the first half of 1957, he seized the illusion of a small number of farmers in Ichuan County eating stone surface, and frenzily attacked food purchase and sales policy. Pan fusheng said in communicating the Central Qingdao meeting: 'Long live Chairman Mao, eat stone face standing team.' 'Farmer's house has no overnight food.' 'The provincial committee has broken down the grain work in the past few years.' 'The provincial committee is too honest to turn the province of food deficit into the province of surplus grain, and should be held accountable.' Pan fusheng, Yang Jue and Wang Tingdong also actively advocate to expand their own land, and not buy and sell them, saying: 'We should go back into the grain issue. At present, it is very dangerous.' Wang Tingdong also shouted: 'The grain system pushed farmers very badly.' 'Farmers believe that socialism has no head,' he said. 'The food problem is really serious,' said: 'The people generally reflect that Chairman Mao in Henan is not as good as Chairman Mao of Hubei and Shanxi, and that the party group relations are very tense.' On May 20 last year, Wang Tingdong said at the provincial committee meeting: 'The people said Chairman Mao did not understand the situation. There was no way for grassroots cadres, and there was a traitor at the middle level.' He also proposed a proposal to eliminate the all-food acquisition policy. According to their plan, each year the province needs central supply of 2.3 billion pounds of food in Henan. This has resulted in the total elimination of the all-food acquisition policy. \\nShelter the right, sabotage the anti-right struggle, and the right echoes to attack the party inside and outside\\nIn the first half of 1957, the bourgeoisie right took the opportunity of the party to rampant attack on the party. Pan revived praised the anti-party remarks of right-wing elements. He said: 'Everyone has read the People's Daily, Zhang Naiji... speaks very thoroughly.' He also said: 'I have received letters everywhere that are not satisfied with our Henan. Professor Kaifeng (note: right-wing Li Baifeng), has already written a letter, and we agree with him.' He even compared right-wing attacks against the party to the revolutionary 'May Fourth' movement. He said: 'At present, Beijing and Shanghai are very nervous. Everyone's thinking is struggling. Indeed, there is a bit of the situation of the May Fourth Movement, and the field of thought is good.' At that time, the right side cursed us not to understand pretending, Pan fusheng also said at a meeting: 'People said that the provincial committee did not understand pretending. This is very right, we just don't understand pretending.' Then he called on everyone to learn from the right. He said: 'From the provincial committee, all party comrades must learn from the people.' Pan fusheng described opposition rhetoric by right-wing elements against cooperation, opposition to the general purchase and sale of food, slandering the party's leadership, attacking the party's policies, and attacking the anti-opposition movement, all as constructive opinions. He also said: 'The intellectuals are not accustomed to socialism. There is a wall ditch between us and them. People criticize us with pride and complacency, we are proud to be complacent, they do not treat themselves equally, do not understand pretending, saying that they have no authority, indeed, this is the case.' Pan fusheng openly shouted that the Party could not lead the school. He said: 'People think you Communist Party can't work, do not understand business, say we can not lead, I can not lead. My opinion, take a demonstration of several universities, and set up school committees... should be all from the left and right.' Yang Jue also actively advocated the establishment of a 'School Committee'. He also said: 'The party cannot lead science.' Both Pan fusheng and Yang Jue said: 'Su anti-people have caught' and 'blow the face wide.' \\nThe anti-right struggle began with Pan's revival and Yang Jue, wearing the garment of leading the anti-right struggle, tried to shelter the right-wing elements and sabotaging the anti-right struggle. They insisted on underdrawing the right, apparently the right, they did not approve it; even for those who had already struggled the right, they also let apologize to the head of the authorities. They fear the right fights. Pan revived said: 'Rightists storms on us, and we want to wind and rain on the right.' Say that the contradiction between the right-wing and us is 'not a contradiction against me.' Pan regeneration is afraid to launch the masses. In his report of first mobilization against the right, he said, 'Most comrades have simple impatience.' 'Some comrades stirred the tail again, grace people, rough engaged, can not clamp the tail to be human.' Just over a dozen days of the campaign, he said: 'The main bias is impatience and the expansion of the blow surface.' In the struggle, they laid down a number of rules to restrain the hands and feet of the masses and the right. 'It is not appropriate to make public naming or disguised public naming of right-wing elements and publicizing the history of right-wing elements,' he said. 'Some units even form group struggles, adopt a method of subjecting people and cannot convince people.' 'As for cadres and masses to question the right, we can persuade the masses not to adopt such an approach.' That is, rightists who want to withdraw from the wind and avoid the struggle, can only 'pay attention to persuasion, not to force.' Even the right-wing 'death', he also said, 'The main reason is that we are not working enough.' How about Pan's revival for the rightists so much love, how is it to party activists? In addition to scolding activists for 'flourishing people' and 'sewing the tail', what is more pernicious is to curse activists 'sneaky', 'thieves work' and 'ugly'. The rules laid down by Pan Recovery are enforced in the name of the provincial committee. He said: 'Under the leadership of the provincial committee, not be allowed to arouse independence.' Of course, the conspiracy of Pan fusheng and Yang Jue did not succeed. The Henan Party organization resolutely implemented the instructions of the Central Committee, struggled with Pan's revival, and resolutely fought against the right-wing elements, and achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution on the political front and on the ideological front. \\nAdhere to the Publication of Development Capitalism Programme-'Advocacy Points'\\nOn June 25, 1957, under the firm proposition of Pan's revival, the 'Propaganda points on incentives for the development of agricultural production for the autumn harvest' was published. This propaganda point is a platform that undermines socialism and develops capitalism. The programme was shaped like this: as far back as 1956, after agricultural cooperation, they did not see the mainstream of the cooperative movement, which had transformed the private ownership of the means of production for thousands of years and opened a broad path to the development of social productivity. But only to grasp the individual shortcomings in the movement, hearsay, capture the wind, try to exaggerate it, say what cooperation is 'risking in', the community is large, the livestock has died, the economy is stagnant, the peasant food retention standards are low, the farmers' living suffering, the production sentiment is not high, and so on. Yang Jue went to Anyang, Shangqiu, Luoyang and other areas to visit, mainly to collect materials in these areas. In particular, in the Shangqiu region, policies promoting private land land, private planting of trees without a burden for several years and stimulating production through private economic development were studied. After Yang Jue returned, he gave a report to Pan fusheng, and Pan fusheng appreciated. In the first half of 1957, after Pan's recovery work resumed, it was even more pretext to ease the internal contradictions of the people, develop production and grapple with these problems, and tried to prove that cooperation in 1956 'risked', mess up and attacked the leadership of the provincial committee during his incubation. So, last May, sent Wang Tingdong to Anyang, Yang Jue to Xuchang, Nanyang, Pingdingshan and other places to collect the above related materials. Phan was very confident of their materials and appointed the Ministry of Rural Work to draft policies to reward the development of production. The Ministry of Rural Work drafted a simple document, Pan Recovery was not satisfied, and instructed Wang Tingdong to modify it. Wang Tingdong, based on the materials they collected below, modified it to become a more systematic development capitalist platform. When the program was presented to the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee, many comrades made different opinions. Although some articles were added to safeguard socialism, they did not fundamentally change the nature of the propaganda point of development capitalism. The basic spirit of th"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "is propaganda point is to encourage and support the capitalist ideology of the wealthy farmers who leave the community, and unilaterally promote and reward private land, planting trees, breeding livestock, large numbers of pig raising, expanding community holdings, raising food retention standards, developing individual family side jobs, emphasizing openness and freedom Markets, etc., seek to stimulate farmers' productive activity by developing private economies and damaging the socialist economy. \\nWhen the 'propaganda points' were published, landlords, rich farmers, anti-revolutionaries, bad elements, and wealthy farmers with serious capitalist ideas clapped their hands quickly and rallied all over the community and left the community, and satirically hit cadres. What to say 'Taisha becomes a small society this year, next year, next year, the mutual aid group becomes single.' Most of the rural party members and the vast majority of poor farmers and farmers are very dissatisfied. Party organizations at all levels have raised objections. However, Pan revived, they not only ignored them, but instead preached their fallacy of 'taking back as a step forward' and 'step back and two steps', saying what their policies can 'develop production'. 'Increasing social wealth'. They want to do everything possible to implement this capitalist agenda. At the end of June to mid-July last year, they set aside the provincial committee and held a meeting of the provincial committee office directors in two batches. At this meeting, the implementation of the Propaganda Points was examined, the shortcomings in the collection process were further identified and the districts were determined to implement the Propaganda Points. Pan fusheng also arranged the head of the county committee office to go back to supervise the county committee; Yang Jue spoke more about his reactionary fallacy of 'step back, two steps forward' at the meeting, and said: 'This means this is this way, you go back and don't say that.' At the meeting of local and municipal committee secretaries held on July 11 last year, Pan fusheng said: 'The Propaganda Points of the Provincial Committee cannot be shaken. The Provincial Committee and the Land Committee should implement the Party's policy. This is not for the purpose of stimulating for a moment. This is a fundamental problem. Without this thing, farmers want revolt. Peasants may not want to be led by the Communist Party. Guide.' Comrades should be 'party guarantee, firmly implement'. When Pan revived returned from attending the Central Qingdao Conference, it was clear that 'propaganda points' were completely contrary to the spirit of the Qingdao meeting, and he still stubbornly insisted on his wrong agenda. In the forum of four county committee secretaries held on August 2 last year, when setting up the socialist education key experiment, he said: 'The Propaganda Points of the Provincial Committee should be combined with the implementation of the work, this thing is dangerous, some places shaken, one is not buying and selling on its own, this is 1.6 billion less, you don't. Support, not mutable. You have to support the provincial committee, this is my thought.' And said: 'Another is the sweet potato 5 kg fold 1 pound, less 400 million pounds, now unchanged'. When he talked about the scattered feeding of livestock, he said: 'You just say that cooperation is superior. Your girlwife pulled the rake, do not think I'm talking for the right.' Linru County Committee secretary reported: '743 households in the county asked to withdraw, officially quit 47.' Pan fusheng said: 'Too little to retreat.' He questioned the secretary of the Xinxiang County Committee and said: 'I heard that you issued the Provincial Committee's 'Propaganda Points', and abolished freedom of retirement.' At that time, the secretary of the county committee was very difficult to say: 'It has been added later.' (Note: Actually it does not add up), Pan fusheng added: 'Our 'propaganda points' are dangerous. Some people are not in favor of keeping their own purchase and selling, calculating 1.6 billion kilograms of grain less, some also advocate buying and selling. At that time, local and county committees generally reflected that according to the 'propaganda points', the country could not buy food. He said: 'Sweet potatoes are 5 pounds off and 1 kg. It seems that the country has bought less food and actually increased the wealth of society.' He used such a sceptical approach to undermining the socialist economy and preserving and developing the capitalist economy. And insults the comrades who oppose the 'propaganda points' 'don't make sweeps, have high fever, and say Hu Tu's words; next year, the bad people will not forgive it. This is the situation, to estimate'. This shows that his own adherence to the capitalist agenda has reached a high level of fever. \\nDeceive the center, against the right route of the center\\nAfter the high level of cooperation in agriculture, Pan Recovery, in order to attack cooperation and food work, he went to the central government, and in front of the Comrade in charge of the Central Committee, consciously distorted the real situation in Henan, exaggerated the shortcomings in his work and tried to blur the Central Committee. Prior to attending the Qingdao meeting, there was a systematic and dedicated collection of negative material and exaggerated. Attempts to justify his right-wing opportunistic view at the Qingdao meeting. However, when he arrived in Qingdao, after hearing Chairman Mao's instructions, he was afraid to expose his horse's feet. When he reported to Chairman Mao, he added some positive words, added some fabricated material, concealed some of the wrong material originally intended to report. Upon his return, he made some changes to his report outline: he added some interferences with Chairman Mao and issued five plenary sessions of the provincial committee, thereby indicating that the Central Committee agreed to his report outline, in an attempt to obscure the provincial committee and to insist on implementing his capitalist line. When he conveys the spirit of the Qingdao meeting, using his right-leaning opportunistic views and corresponding negative material, distorted and amended Chairman Mao's direction. At the same time, he and Yang Jue consulted behind not to allow Comrade Wu Zhipu to convey the contents of the Central Food Conference and completely consciously conceal their unauthorized use of the name of the provincial committee. Commenting on the instructions of the anti-right party of Xingyang County Committee He feared that the five plenary meetings of the Provincial Committee would be detrimental to him after discussing the spirit of the Qingdao meeting and the Central Food Conference. Therefore, the meeting was held for only two or three days. He plotted with Yang Jue and Wang Tingdong to plan the summary content and try to end the meeting. However, comrades from the provincial committee broke their tricks and fought seriously against Pan's revival anti-socialist anti-socialist words and deeds, retracted their wholesale false instructions and stopped propaganda and implementation of the 'Propaganda Points'. Pan regeneration was forced to do a partial review. In accordance with the spirit of the Qingdao Conference, the plenary redeployed its work. In order to cover up the true face of his anti-party anti-socialist anti-socialism, for six days, Cang busy went to Xinxiang County to listen to the reports of six agricultural societies, wrote a study report, and was very pleased to catch two new wealthy farmers forgot the typical book, believing that he seized 'Liu Jiemei of Henan', the material was false. That's wrong with good people. Shortly after his visit, when Chairman Mao came to Henan, Pan fusheng dared to deceive Chairman Mao in person. He did not mention his own series of mistakes and his criticism of him at the five plenary meetings (enlargement), of the Provincial Committee. Instead, he boasted his study report and the two examples he caught, still trying to deceive the Central Committee and conceal himself. Error. \\nFormation of anti-party sects to carry out secessionist conspiracy\\nSince Pan fusheng, Yang Jue and Wang Tingdong's political ideas oppose socialism and develop capitalism agree, they have gradually formed anti-party sectarian activities in the organization in an attempt to split the party. Usually, they contend with each other and touted each other, provoke discord between the provincial committee, spread rumors, and conspiracies in an attempt to negate the achievements of the provincial committee during the period of Pan's rehabilitation and disease (summer 1954-spring 1957), in order to achieve the purpose of the separatist party. After achieving cooperation in 1956, Pan fusheng and Yang Jue have a great view on cooperation, saying that 'risking in', 'many left problems' and 'need to wipe the ass.' They often collect material in this area, talk in private, and take the opportunity to attack the party. By the spring of 1957, the wind movement was about to begin, and when anti-socialists in urban and rural areas began to attack the party, Pan Recovery thought that the time had come and could not wait to resume work. He and Yang Jue maliciously attacked the leadership of the Provincial Committee, headed by Comrade Wu Zhipu in the previous section, saying, 'to mess up the work,' 'make the cooperation mess', 'no longer raise the disease,' and 'to reverse the situation.' After Pan fusheng resumed work, Yang Jue and Wang Tingdong activities were more rampant. They leave aside other comrades from the provincial committee, transcend the organization, hold the whole wind, fight against the right, hold the daily work of the provincial committee, manipulate the provincial committee's offices, and Pan regenerate arbitrarily and exert paternalistic leadership. He was reluctant to listen to different opinions, many major issues of principle, three of them had a chirp, and did not consult with comrades of the provincial committee at all, and in their eyes there would be no Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee and the Secretariat. That is to meet, Pan's revival often speaks of a set, imposed on others; or, three of them prepare documents beforehand and suddenly get the meeting in an attempt to forcibly pass. That is how they vandly undermine the party's democratic centralization and the party's collective leadership principle. In order to realize their criminal plot to split the Party, Yang Jue and Wang Tingdong went to areas such as Xuchang, Nanyang, Pingdingshan, and Anyang, respectively, to collect anti-party material, and enlarged on the one hand, attack cooperation and the general purchase and sale of food. At this time, Pan fusheng and Yang Jue saw the bourgeois right offensive to the party rampant in society, believing that the time is ripe. Pan fusheng and Yang Jue insisted on convening four plenary meetings of the provincial committee and asked the secretary of the county committee to attend; Yang Jue also advocated the opening of a party congress to inspect the leadership of the provincial committee. During the four plenary meetings of the Provincial Committee (enlarged), Pan fusheng repeatedly stipulated that the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee and the provincial departments responsible comrades should not be allowed to speak, while he himself took the lead, foment the fire, and encouraged everyone to attack the correct leadership of the Provincial Committee during his incubation. Yang Jue and Wang Tingdong also enlarged at the meeting. They grabbed the individual shortcomings in the areas of cooperation, food, cadre style, and so on, to attack one point, not less than the rest, and threatened to hold the provincial committee responsible, 'pursue responsibility' and 'ask the Central Committee for disciplinary action.' At this point, Pan fusheng, Yang Jue, and Wang Tingdong attempted to form an anti-party sectarian sectarian division and split the leadership of the provincial committee, and the conspiracy to engage in capitalism in Henan was exposed. Their conspiracy activity has developed until last August of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Provincial Committee (enlarged), after the criticism of the mistakes of Pan's revival, and in fact turned to a defensive trend, to cover up mistakes and standby reversals. \\nTheir sectarian activity is not accidental. While working together in the Plain Provincial Committee, they appreciated each other and boasted about each other. When they arrived in Henan, they developed even more so that they formed anti-party sects. \\nPunish cadres, stigmatize poor farmers\\nPan Recovery often stigmatized cadres 'do not understand pretending', 'old shelf', 'old qualifications', 'nepotism', 'bureaucratic' and 'law-breaking elements'. Scolding cadres are 'banditry style', 'bully style', 'KMT style', 'like an agent'. Whenever certain events occur when there is tension in class struggles, Pan regenerates indiscriminately, always blame the cause of 'bad style of cadres', always long enemy ambitions, extinguish himself and surrender to the enemy's knees, and severely punish cadres. Pan fusheng also created a set of fallacy that called 'criticism is the motivation, praise is not the motivation'. 'Say that achievements are ugly performance', oppose praise cadres, misrepresent criticism as punishment, and 'pursue responsibility' and 'impose strict punishment.' In 1953, Pan's recovery just arrived in Henan, he said that Henan's political ideology was weak, cadres were badly practiced, and the typical so-called 'illegal and undisciplined' were caught everywhere, and vigorously punished cadres. In 1957, Pan Recovery just resumed his work, he seized the so-called 'illegal and disciplined' incident in the three counties of Yongcheng, Xiayi and Civil Rights. In handling this incident, 6 people expelled from the party, 10 people who left the party to see, 9 people who had been seriously warned, 9 people who had been seriously warned, 9 warned People, and cadres were sentenced to jail. After handling this incident, Pan revived also threatened to investigate the 'culprit' and 'culprit'. \\nPan fusheng has consistently stigmatized poor farmers. After the end of the land reform, poor farmers actively follow the path of mutual aid and cooperation. Pan revived abused poor farmers to 'take pride in poverty' and 'rely on fighting rice', 'asking for money from the government and wiping agricultural oil in one hand'. After cooperation, poor farmers actively produce, he slandered 'for the purpose of earning work,' saying that 'poor farmers have no productive experience.' However, he was concerned about the affluent farmers, and he personally received the wealthy farmers who asked to retire, and supported them to drop off, and said, 'Withdrawal is not not not to take the socialist path.' It can be seen that Pan regeneration and affluent farmers are closely related, with the heart of mind. Yang Jue and Wang Tingdong also have exactly the same views on poor farmers and wealthy farmers. Yang Jue said: 'Shangqiu has an agricultural society, 17 management committee members, only one knows production.' Wang Tingdong said: 'There is much pressure to criticize wealthy Chinese farmers. All bad things are attributed to the rich farmers, and the slogan of consolidating solidarity among farmers is not louder.' The above facts can fully demonstrate that Panxiasheng and other people depend on, who fight against, and serve for whom, is clear. \\nLife Corruption, Pursuing a Bourgeois Lifestyle\\nPan revived his life in his life, talk about broad air, actively pursue the bourgeois way of life. He advocates that cadres get dressed. He said, 'Without wearing a woolen clothes, there is no culture!' When the provincial capital moved to Zheng, he advocated the magnificent building of the house. After Qianzheng, he continued to say, 'Henan is unwilling to come to work in Henan.' 'Zhengzhou poor acid, can't afford to entertain foreign guests.' Comrade Du Xuezhou, secretary-general of the Nanyang Land Commission, wore an old coat to see his illness. He said, 'Wearing an old coat has passed the times, not like a socialist look.' In terms of personal life, during medical care, travel everywhere, and travel around the country with hospital directors, nurses, secretaries, protection section chiefs, lovers, etc., taking photos of visitors, squandering waste, life is extremely corrupt. That's it, he also told other comrades that the provincial committee did not care about the patient and did not go to see him. Yang Jue on weekdays likes to sell small smart, show individuals everywhere; in order to get name and fame, he does not hesitate to take despicable means, plagiarize subordinate reports and articles of others, makeover, published in his own name, and even tamper himself, wholesale himself. \\nAccording to the above facts, Right-leaning Opportunist Pan revived, consistently insisting on a stubborn bourgeois position, and is an outright revisionist and extremist bourgeois individualist. He has long distorted the situation in Henan, dressed in the garment of Marxinism, confronted with revisionist views and political lines of the central government. In the anti-party activities of Pan fusheng, Yang Jue and Wang Tingdong, in particular Yang Jue, are in line with the political ideological point of view. \\nFor several years, the organization of the Henan Party has been struggling with the right-leaning opportunistic ideology of the revival of Pan. Pan fusheng came to work in Henan in the spring of 1953, and from summer 1954 to spring 1957. He actually worked in Henan for more than two years. At the beginning of his birth, Pan released a 'ten announcement' in Henan, and the struggle began since then. Later, a sharp struggle had been waged on agricultural cooperation and food issues. Others have also struggled in the production of disaster relief efforts. Shortly after the resumption of work in Pan's recovery last spring, he and Yang Jue and Wang Tingdung sharpened to attack the party at the four plenary meetings (enlarged), of the provincial committee. At the Fifth Plenary Session of the Provincial Committee (enlarged), the provincial committee and Pan revived a serious struggle, revealing the true face of his deceit and resisting the Central Committee and adhering to the capitalist position. From the Fifth Plenary Session of the Provincial Committee until now, the provincial committee has been waiting for and helping him conscientiously talk about the anti-party words and deeds. During this period, the Comrade in charge of the Provincial Committee has written several letters (he raised the disease in Beijing), and individual conversations to help him recognize his mistakes, but for more than 10 months, Pan's revival has not really repented. During the second meeting of the Eighth Party Congress, the Henan representative group also engaged in a serious struggle with Pan's recovery. Especially at this meeting of the provincial committee enlargement, comrade Pan fusheng, Yang Jue and Wang Tingdong engaged in fierce struggles, exposing their large numbers of anti-party anti-socialist words and deeds, giving them serious criticism in political ideology. In the face of the facts, Pan revived openly and answered without words, and had to admit that he denied class struggles, was a bourgeois position, followed the path of capitalism, engaging in sectarian activities and other anti-party words and deeds. However, he still does not wish to seriously and thoroughly dig the roots of his thoughts, continue to confront the party, avoiding weight, and avoiding the important joint problem, and avoiding talking about it. Although Yang Jue made several representations at the meeting and carried out a preliminary examination of his anti-socialist activities against the party, his attitude was very cunning, and activities were carried out outside the meeting in an attempt to mingle. Although Wang Tingdong unveiled some materials from Pan fusheng and Yang Jue, and began a review, he selflessly revised the shorthand of his speeches that he enlarged when he attacked the party at the four plenary meetings of the provincial committee (enlargement), last year, and was extremely unhonest. \\nIn order to continue to allow Pan fusheng, Yang Jue and Wang Tingdong to fully account for their anti-party words and deeds, and in order to completely expose criticism and remove the influence of thought and other ideological influences of Pan Recovery, except that the Central Committee has abolished the duties of the first secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of Pan Recovery, the Plenary decided to abolish Pan Recovery from the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee and recommended the relevant ministries Door abolished the Henan military district political commissioner, chairman of provincial political consultative committee, etc. Positions. In response to Yang Jue and Wang Tingdong, they decided to suspend their duty to reflect on their opposition and deeds. \\nThe plenary also unanimously decided that in the fourth phase of the wind, a sharp ideological struggle should be carried out among the whole party in Henan and the people of the province by exposing anti-socialist remarks and deeds against the anti-socialist anti-socialism of the anti-party, including Yang Jue, criticism of the revival of Pan and Yang Jue. \\nThe plenary concluded with discussions and arrangements for future work. Comrade in charge of the provincial committee made a systematic speech on the major achievements and basic experience on the front of industry, agriculture, finance and trade in the first half of this year and the great leap forward in the overall work of the organization in the second half of this year. The spirit of the Central Education Conference was also conveyed. \\nThe plenary believes that our province is now in a period of great change that 'one day equals twenty years' and one year equals thousands of years. Inspired by the unprecedented harvest of summer crops, to meet and organize new production construction climax, comrades in meeting and organizing new production construction, unanimously said that they would struggle for six months of hard war, and fight for a greater harvest next year. The Plenary believes that after two road struggles and a great leap forward in production in the countryside, a large number of socialist activists have emerged; the communist spirit of the masses has risen greatly, a new style for me for all and for everyone; the agrarian technological revolution and the cultural revolution are flourishing; in order to adapt to a larger scale The construction of water conservancy and striving for a greater harvest, labor organization and production management are also constantly improving; due to the summer harvest, It has greatly increased the public accumulation of agricultural societies; the climax of the industry has emerged; and leaders at all levels have created and accumulated experience leading the great leap forward in production. In cities, state-owned industries and local industries have also developed greatly, exceeding the first half of the production plan, and the movement of technological innovation in the factory and mining has also emerged tens of millions of new people. Great achievements have been made on the financial and trade front, the cultural and educational front and other areas. The situation in the province tells us that the problem of industrial and agricultural production can be solved quickly. The matter is man-made, people are determined to win the day. As long as we reject right-leaning opportunism, rebutt the theory of slower miserality, reject the 'watchmen', 'other tidal' or 'post-autumn account counting', not paralyzed by victory, not pessimism because of difficulties, adhere to the party's masses and class lines, we can build socialism at high speed. \\nThe plenary held that in agriculture, our slogan is 'one and a half years of bitter war, with a total output of 100 billion, double kilos per person' to solve the problem of food fundamentally. The main task is to ensure the completion and excess of the fall grain production of 30 billion pounds, and to lay the foundation for a bigger harvest next year. In order to accomplish this combat mission, the fall crop needs to be planted, managed, and overcome natural disasters and harvesting. Particular attention should be paid to catch three types of crops, check vulnerabilities, eliminate three types of seedlings. To engage in water conservancy, it requires the total elimination of flood and drought within 2 years. Reservoirs and soil conservation in mountainous and hilly areas, and riverine in the plains. Big fertilizer and deep turn over the land, require to accumulate five trillion pounds before autumn, wheat applied 30,000 pounds per mu, top top 20 thousand pounds. Demands before planting wheat deep over 80 million acres, next year the province's cropland populates once. Promotion of dense planting and excellent varieties. Great tool reform. Development of livestock and forestry, etc. Leaders should pay special attention to seize 7, 8, 9 for three months. First, take good ideas and mobilize ideas, carry out a general national debate, combined with the implementation of the overall line of implementation, expose right-leaning opportunistic ideas such as criticism of Pan's recovery; and, secondly, take advanced measures and formulate production plans for next year to prepare for a bigger harvest next year. \\nOn the industrial side, mainly the Daban steel industry, requires the production of 1.5 million tons of iron this year and 4 million to 5 million tons next year; steel production of 300,000 to 400,000 tons this year, and next year's real production reaches about 2.5 million tons. Our slogan is 'Carry out the mass of tens of millions of small blast furnace steel production campaign.' This year, the construction of small soil furnace, simple small blast furnace and so on 30,000 seats. In order to accomplish the above tasks, it is inevitable to break the skepticism of industrial production, divine myths, conditionalities; we must implement the policy of 'relying on the masses, self-reliance, small, small, mainly to serve agricultural production, on a small basis, large, medium and small'. In order to accelerate the development of the steel and small industries and to meet the requirements of rapid agricultural mechanization and electrification, the machinery industry must be vigorously developed. \\nIn terms of finance and trade, the Plenary believes that the work on the financial and trade front and industrial production are very close, and must adapt to the situation of the big leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, starting from production, starting from the center work, and all the work on the financial and trade front is to be fully done. Demands that summer grain acquisition tasks be exceeded by July and a half ago. In the work, two roads and two methods of food work should be carried out big debate, criticize right-leaning ideas, verify yields, implement policies seriously, and do food custody work. Commercial work, continue to implement the policy of big purchase, make good supply of materials of production, supply of living materials, and agricultural products procurement work, and generally implement the 'three societies in one', make good adjustments to business networks and foreign trade work. Actively complete this year's financial tasks on the basis of development of production, and make money delivery and return work to promote the big leap forward in production. Carry out mass transportation work. \\nIn the area of cultural and educational health, all regions are required to implement the spirit of the Central Education Conference in order to promote a more rapid development of the cultural revolution. The province is required to complete the literacy mission by the end of October, and continue to insist on the elimination of the remnants of four hazards and actively carry out scientific research work. \\nFinally, Comrade Wu Zhipu made a concluding statement at the meeting, and the essence of the thought of Pan's revival was extremely deeply analytical and critical. And pointed out that under the chairmanship of Pan Recovery, the 'Ten Announcements' issued in 1953 and the 'propaganda points' issued in 1957 are all development capitalist platform things, these two programs, to the cause of the Henan people and the Henan Party's cause is very serious, because their reactionary claims, many have already Become a fact. Therefore, criticism of Pan fusheng, Yang Jue and Wang Tingdong's exposures can not be solved by several meetings. A long-term and repeated struggle must be carried out. The white flag must be uprooted and the red flags are generally plugged in. Finally, Comrade Wu Zhipu called on everyone to understand the current political situation, carry out two ways and two ways of fighting, earnestly learn the Party's overall socialist construction line, arm ideas, take advantage of the three important tasks of food, steel and machinery, and drive a great leap forward in the overall work. \\nFrom the beginning of the meeting, intense, comrades liberated, comfortable mood, 100 times confidence, vigorous, united, determined to implement the spirit of the conference seriously, carry out the ideological movement that criticizes the revival of Pan, Yang Jue, Wang Tingdong right-leaning opportunism, promote the liberation of ideas; and Grab good industrial and agricultural production, to ensure the autumn harvest, meet the first representative of our provincial party At the third meeting of the General Assembly, the whole party was mobilized to achieve the resolution of the second meeting of the Party's Eighth Congress.

Later on to Tsinghua school,Strokes too complicated,I changed the word after the end to 'Dan'。 The information we see now, starting in October 1920, began to use a new name. As for the pseudonym, all can be identified, have been noted in the 'anthology', here do not have to enumerate. There are, however, some interesting cases that can be explained. Some pseudonyms seem to contain his own encounters and features, such as: Kanhou, Kui An, Guizai, □ Zhai, 'Shengzai' and 'Filling Up', but also may be related to fasting, because his book in Shanghai is called 'Kuian Bibliography', and another name is called 'Victory'. At the end of a communication he also wrote: 'Li Tiekuai, the person who wrote this communication.' Some pseudonyms contain the name of the child, such as 'big interpretation', is after the birth of the first girl, the child died, so there has been a 'JI deduction'; later used 'Mufu', 'the Father'; 'and the Father' is and after the birth, and then 'Hefu'. When translating Minen Pu's article on the characteristics of Chinese people, the use of 'self-litigation' is used, which probably contains a deep sense of criticizing oneself and self-improvement. \\nWhen his father was attending school in Tsinghua school, leg injuries caused by sports and later had to saw a leg due to tuberculosis bacteria invaded the knee. Strangely enough, I was small to big, and thought never seemed to associate him with the word 'maimed'. Maybe because he is agile, cheerful, does not feel that he is too different from ordinary people, perhaps because of kinship, too familiar but not to distinguish. I remember that in 1942 I went to the General Assembly Attachment School, and stayed in his dormitory at the Tsinghua office in Xicangpo, and before giving me another wooden bed, his empty one leg had the right to charge my bunk. At that time I was 11 years old, and a man was small, and my head was facing one of his feet, and I could rest. It was until the state started the cause of disabled people in recent years and listened much, and suddenly one day realized that my father was a 'disabled person'. In retrospect, he was hit by this at the beginning, probably had a wave of thought, and he must have experienced a lot of difficulties in his action before honing it into a later look. My uncle told me that my father joined Christianity at this time. However, in 1926, he criticized Christian concepts by writing Christianity and China: An Observation of Cultural Communication. In the case of that year, it is best to read Mr. Mei Yibao's memory text:\\nI entered Tsinghua in 1915 and saw him for the first time. He was already a one-legged guest. In the previous year he jumped high fell and injured the legs. Doctors owe smart, delay for a while, turned out to be treated, can only cut the wound legs. He had pretended prosthetics, but trouble was better than abduction, and he was abducted for his life. He has a single leg, but the general action is no later. Weekend classmates walks on an outing, he never absent. He and I were passionate about the YMCA. One meeting was held at Wat Pho in Xishan. An arrangement was held at the temple's back hill gate (equal to the middle of the mountain). The old Pan also climbed the mountain, if nothing happened. (Tsinghua and Me)\\nIn the Hobbies column of an alumni questionnaire, he says: Travel. I felt fresh when I first saw it because I didn't know it in the past. Although knowing that he often travels, before and after going out also always looks very pleasant, never troubles performance, but reaching the degree of 'hobby' seems to be another thing. Again, this form may be filled by hand, the people who fill in and see people do not need to seriously. In any case, the physical condition of disability and the hobby of travel are always contradictory. Still see what he said:\\nBut if the Chinese say, it seems to be different. Our problems are traveling too little. Not only do we travel less, but also have to say some pretty self-circle words, such as 'show is not going out, can know the world' and so on. If the Americans before the recession were to walk a moving extreme, we would be a quiet extreme. \\nSo no matter what the American professor said, I am advocating that the Chinese should travel more. China's places are so large, the geographical environment has changed so much, the historical background is so far away, and the background is so different, if we rely on the knowledge of some books and do not travel, do not give the eyes and ears a chance to contact the field, to teach a national element to have a poor strong person about the country's history. I thought it was impossible. From the day of this knowledge, I have not used any opportunity to travel. \\nIn the school age, in addition to the Shanghai area close to their hometown, only once to Nanjing, once in Ningbo; Beiping, because of reading relations, will have to travel once a year, together to more than eight or nine times. In addition, there is nothing to say. 16 years, finally went to Hangzhou, Zhenjiang, Suzhou; 17 years to Putuo Mountain; eighteen years to Dalian, Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin. 19 years to Matsue. 20 years to Qingdao, Yantai, Weixian, Jinan, Jiujiang, Lushan, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Wuxi. In early 22 years there were Hankou, Hangjiang Road and counties that went up and down the Qiantang River. This year \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), for the first time to visit Jiaxing, there are the main points of the Hanghui Highway, Yangzhou. Recently there was a trip from Yulu provinces. (The first paragraph of the trip of Yu Jin)\\nThis spirit and behavior throughout his life. Every trip is often carried with Xu Xia Travellers or try to equip a local journal book, compare the records of the former with their own observations, and write some knowledgeable, vivid notes or journals. As a disabled person, of course, he will encounter more difficulties than others. In fact, there has also been climbing and falling horses and slipping and other things like a horrible accident, reflected in his text, often out of the witty tone. \\nIn the spring of 1952, I participated in the completion of the land and changed back to Peking University, and the school's anti-intellectuals movement was finished. One day comrade from the college party committee asked me to talk to me: 'Pan guangdan's review has not passed, his knowledge is too poor, but the old dragging is not possible, and his review cannot be ended without passing the campaign. Now we have to think to help him get him through, not just hang inside. Now that Tsinghua wants to hold a conference, you have to go and make a statement. Peking University Zhou Binglin Review Conference, his son went up to speak, he was very moved and was very helpful for his transformation.' At that time, Pan was the key target of the Tsinghua movement. Zhou was a key object of Peking University and two of the biggest priorities of Beijing universities. I find it difficult to speak. I have not read much of my father's writings and there is no real content in the speech. Second, I am well aware of the character of my father, and my statement will never touch him, and it will be counterproductive. In three cases, I have always been silent and unspeakable, and I do not love to speak at the panel meetings, let alone the General Assembly. I gave the reason to the leader, but failed to convince him. In the end, I had to prepare a brief statement, which was basically a statement. I hope that my father would stand up to the people's position to transform the cloud well. After the leadership review, they were not satisfied, but it was difficult to change it again, and I spoke like that. My father did not say anything about my statement afterwards. After that, his review is even passed. However, the father's problem will never end there. This movement has already criticized the issue of the so-called 'Lorongi small group'. The anti-right movement has captured the Zhangluo Union at the beginning, and the issue of the 'Lorongi small group' was immediately raised again to criticize. Now, reading the 'Three Counter Express' of that year, it is clear that criticism was high on the platform and the attack was no less than the struggle against the right and the cultural revolution, and even raised some issues of a serious nature and had never been given an opportunity to clarify. For example, problems in the Tsinghua student movement in 1936. In the 1980s, Mr. Li Shu-qing wrote: 'Mr. Pan, as an imperial teacher, also sympathizes with the students' patriotic enthusiasm. However, the school authorities always feel that the school authorities have the responsibility for the safety and reading of their students to their parents, fearing the tragedy caused by wrestling, or causing students to be arrested and left behind in prison, deserted school, especially when the day is false. Peeking, looking for excuses, waving into occupation. On the one hand, the principal asked to go to the city to negotiate with the military and political authorities to persuade them to tolerate; while discouraging students, they were advised to be slightly At this time, the author has been admitted to Tsinghua to stay in the United States for three years, although graduated but still ready to study abroad, so I have a good knowledge of the situation at that time. 'Looking back from now on, to be sure, we cannot believe that Mr. Pan made any 'reactionary' or 'mistakes' in obstructing the student movement during his term as Provost.' Mr. Pan guangdan, a memorial practitioner, said Mr. Qian Weichang: 'He is the Provost, and every time we look for him for an interview. He is very reasonable. Mr. Pan has this characteristic, and he can always speak a set of reasons. The truth was finished with student dissatisfaction, and I was also very dissatisfied. But after that, he always left me, because I belonged to a graduate student, and secretly told me a word: 'You listened to it, and the school was not totally against you, but don't propagate outside, we serve as buffers. ' He is such an attitude that acts as a buffer, the person who protects the youth. 'We have to speak to Nanjing right,' he said. This is always the word. Therefore, he always told people in the student movement that he did not impose sanctions. He usually dismissed two groups of student union presidents. They were arranged before they were expelled. They were released and posted a list to deal with Nanjing. In addition, it would be OK to select a few more people out. So we changed very quickly at that time. This is the case of Mr. Pan. It can be reflected from here that although he was the Provost, he had to say a few words to the authorities, but he was very proportionate and not persecuted students. This is important.' (Speech at the Reception Meeting in 1987), We heard from our mother before that year Mr. Dai Zhong (later named Huang Wei), when the military police surrounded the Tsinghua Garden. (We called it Bai Niang when we were young), took other students once hiding on the ceiling of my house. \\nListening to my mother later, Comrade Wang Feng of the Civil Commission had spoken to his father once, and perhaps it could not be classified as the right. According to her analysis, the intention of the conversation might be: if the father admits that there was a mistake in the Turkish family issue. Because the father did not admit that he had mistakes on the Turkish family issue, he immediately began to criticize. I don't know exactly whether that is the case. In the anti-right struggle, a United Front Committee member of the Democratic House Party Committee came to Peking University to investigate my father's situation. He said to me: If you do not expose your father's problems, it is not good for your personal future. I am very despised for his non-principled words and deeds threatening personal interests. But I did not know what kind of anti-socialist anti-socialist father had, and had to search for a dead intestine and write something I knew about it to him. When he met him at the Library of the House in the 1980s, he took the initiative to say to me: We were all wrong with Mr. Pan's issue. I listened to consternation, unanswered. He was good to admit mistakes, because so far someone could not openly admit his mistakes. But I have no false word about my father, how can he be equated with him, does he want me to share his mistakes? In the late anti-right struggle, one day a comrade from the municipal committee called me and nen□ to talk, meaning: now the money end has ascended to account with imperialists of a very serious nature problems, so suspect Pan guangdan also has this problem. I hope we will talk to him and let him account. I went back and conveyed that to my father, he had nothing to tell, and then wrote the material. I remember he wrote two very long pieces of material, one about his relationship with Loronki and one about relations with 'imperialists.' \\nThe latter copied all paragraphs from his previous Diary concerning contacts with British and American persons. Because he is well sighted and his vision is poor, I will rewrite on my behalf, one to the municipal committee, one to the NLD Central Committee and one to the Party Committee of the Democratic House. I did so without concern, because I was sent first. By the 80s, I heard that Mr. Qian Duansheng had joined the CCP, and I think he certainly did not have problems in this area. History is often unique and ironic. Those who thought of 'American agents' or 'imperialists' on our side were seriously persecuted during the McCarthy era while in his own country considered sympathetic to China rather than 'non-America'. In 1979, Mr. Fei Xiaotong went to lecture, and I accompanied me to see Mae (Mrs. Fei Zhengqing), who said that Fei Chong Ching was persecuted to the point of almost nervous disorders at that time. I also met Mr. Holland, former Pacific International Institute at the University of British Columbia, who told me that he knew my father. He fled to Canada for persecution at the time. When we met him, they also ran a Pacific magazine. It is said that some officials of the US Consulate in Kunming during the War of Resistance against Japan were excluded from business later. The two comrades of the municipal committee leaders I mentioned above, are of integrity, both of whom have a long history of revolutionary struggle and have contributed to them, and they have been persecuted and killed in the Cultural Revolution. I have always paid tribute to them, and I mourn them in the event of memorial service, whether present or not. I see what happened in the past as an inevitable or natural nature of history, but that historical facts should be made public today, so that later people can understand and learn lessons. \\nAs for the father himself, he has always adopted a somewhat different and unscrupulous attitude towards his critical struggles in the various movements. Some of them were saddened by the words and deeds of physical attacks and reluctance to explain more. No resentment, dull. Nogu recalls that when her mother was ill in October 1958, she graduated from college and was awaiting distribution, so her father asked her home to take care of her mother without affecting us. After the death of the mother, the father wowed twice. He always felt that his mother had been overburdened by the struggle against the right and had died prematurely. \\n"},

Chinese modern sociologists, eugenists, ethnographers and educators. He was admitted to Tsinghua School in 1913. Amputees due to injuries to the right leg during sports activities and leave school for two years. Stay in the United States after graduating in 1922 and returning home after receiving a master's degree from Columbia University in 1926. \\nPan guangdan taught after his return home. He also conducted academic research and lectures on Eugenics, Family Issues, Western Social Thought History, Chinese Social Thought, Talent Theory, etc. \\nIt was named 'learning through the West and West, melting ancient and modern, open literary', 'swim between nature, humanities, and social disciplines, without without the use of freedom'. From 1952 to 1967, he was a professor at the Central Institute for Nationalities and Director of the Third Division of Research, and transferred to the study of ethnic history and ethnographic studies. There are 14 volumes of Pan guangdan Episode. \\nDifficult to pass the 'review'\\nHe was the first to review, but also the last person to pass through the Tsinghua Thought Transformation Movement. People think he is particularly stubborn, saying that he is a 'core ball'. \\nIn 1948, the Liberation War Festival triumphed, the Kuomintang retreated south. In early 1949, the PLA army management council first entered the Tsinghua Garden, and then entered Beijing City. His father was a professor at Tsinghua University. \\nAt this turning point in history, he would not follow the KMT: his father joined the NLD in 1941 for years, and in 1946 when more than a professor was assassinated, he was on the KMT blacklist. During the Kunming period, he had direct contact with Communist Party Huagang. So he didn't leave any idea of leaving Beijing or Tsinghua University. In 1949, his father was a member of the Tsinghua University School Committee, Director of Sociology Department and Librarian of the School Library. In accordance with the requirements of the new situation, he listened to the opinions of teachers and students, and presided over the curriculum reform programme for the years of the Faculty of Sociology; he added Marxist-Leninist selected classes, and his father was a member of the lecture. He translated Engels's 'Family, Private Property and Origin of the Country', in combination with the needs of teaching. \\nHe advocated that faculty and students of the sociology department participate in land reform work in the suburbs of Beijing. He also visited the land reform in Southern China. He also visited the land reform in southern China. \\nHe spoke at a symposium on higher education issues in the summer of 1950 and argued that there was no need for major things to go further, and universities should include not only the various disciplines represented by the words, law and science, but also industrial, agricultural and medical subjects. At that time, many university professors, including Ye Qi-sun and Jin Yue-lin, expressed similar views. \\nIn the anti-intellectuals movement, which began in early 1952, fathers became the focus of criticism. His 'reformist' and 'middle course' were criticized mainly politically. He was the first to review, but also the last person to pass through the Tsinghua Thought Transformation Movement. Starting in January at the school teacher and student conference for the first time, three times have not passed, everyone thinks he is particularly stubborn, saying that he is 'iron ball'. It also held a whole school conference to criticize once again, disregarding the fact that he had consistently opposed Jiang and anti-Soviet pro-US before liberation, and remained unchanged after liberation. With the help of the General Assembly, collective and individual help, the final fourth review was barely approved, by October, and the faculties were completed. \\nThe faculties were seen at the time as an outcome of a rethinking movement. Tsinghua, Peking University and Yanjing three universities merged. Peking University and Yanjing's Institute of Engineering went to Tsinghua, and it became a university of engineering. Tsinghua and Yanjing's texts, Li and France all come to Peking University. The political and law faculties of Tsinghua and Peking University have independent political and law faculties. The sociology departments of Tsinghua and Yanjing were canceled. Sociology as a discipline is not available in universities across the country. After the Cultural Revolution, 17 years of experience and lessons were discussed in the press. I once saw an article written by Qian Junrui, former deputy minister of higher education, saying that the faculty adjustment had made a historic mistake. \\nStudy on the Ethnic History of 'Rightists'\\nHis father was mistaken as a right-wing element in the fight against the right, and one of his 'charges' was the so-called 'destruction of national relations.' \\nAfter the faculty adjustment, the father was assigned to the Central Institute for Nationalities together with a group of teachers from the departments of Tsinghua and Yanjing sociology. He served as a professor and director of the third room of the research department in the House. For him, there was certainly a big shift in the direction of professional research, but in the first half of 1953 he completed an academic paper, 'The Chinese Jews in Kaifeng'. There are many ethnic components in the central and southern regions, and historically complex inter-ethnic relations, and ethnic identification problems also existed in the early days of the founding of the new China. In 1953, the Central Civil Commission entrusted the task of studying whether the Turkish family is a single nation to the Central Institute of Nationalities. His father assumed this task, but his legs were inconvenient, and the leadership did not agree that he went to the field investigation. In 1955, he wrote a paper on the basis of historical literature research, 'Tujia' and the ancient Pakistani people in northwest Hunan, believing that the Tujia is a single nation. In the summer of 1956, the father, in conjunction with the CPPCC member's mission to go out to visit the Tujia area in northwest Hunan, conducted field observation and wrote the 'visit to the Tujia' report in northwest Xiangxiang. In the winter, we went to southwestern and southeastern Sichuan area to inspect. \\nIn March 1957, Professor Peking University Xiangda made a joint statement at the plenary session of the CPPCC, 'A brotherly nation in Northwest Xiangxi, Southwest and Southeast Sichuan-Tujia', reporting the situation and put forward recommendations. The Central Committee recognized the Turkish family as a single minority in October 1956. In September 1957, Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture was established. He has made his own contribution, both academically and in solving practical problems of national work. \\nHowever, at this time, the father was mistaken as a right-wing in the fight against the right, and one of his 'charges' was the so-called 'destruction of national relations.' \\nIn this case, Professor Xiang Da was misclassified as the right is also related to the matter. As a result, local Turkish cadres, teachers and students were misclassified as the right, and more than 300 were implicated and punished. He also has a 'charge' of 'restoring bourgeois sociology', 'saying that the Department of Sociology can train many people who work in the masses, united wars, and trade unions.' But then the Soviet Union had resumed sociology. Professor Fei Xiaotong told me that he had the opportunity to meet Chairman Mao in a Supreme State Council that year. He had asked if sociology could be restored? Chairman Mao replied: Yes. Professor Yuan Fang also told me that the restoration of sociology was carried out under the leadership of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Academy of Sciences. But the scholars who later participated in discussions on restoration of sociology were largely misclassified as the right. \\nAt that time, the father was in fact the least to participate in the discussion and express opinions. Another article 'right-wing words and deeds' is 'saying that laymen cannot lead insiders, and that laymen cannot lead cultural and educational work.' \\nBefore the fight against the right, a reporter of Wen Wei Po visited him to talk about 'flowers in all the way' and 'one hundred family brainstorming', asking him 'the bowl cover has been unveiled, why not jump out'? He replied: Breathable is the first, jump does not jump is second. Although he did not participate at the time, he was inevitably mistaken as right-wing. \\nHis character is 'cow leather band'\\nProfessor Fei Xiaotong for his two time-consuming and important work, commented 'His character is the so-called cow leather band, is unyielding, pulling constantly and soft; tireless, inexhaustible, easy to achieve fruitful.' \\nAfter the anti-right struggle, the father went to the Socialist Academy for a year. After returning to the House, for two and a half years, there was no clear work unit and participated in collective campaign work. Mainly engaged in the codification of the Sea, which lasted for a long time and was not finally concluded until 1964; provided comments on the brief draft of the national history, mainly on Jingpo, Tujia and Shes; border information work, mainly providing information in English to China, India, China and Pakistan, and Deng Rui Mr. Ling cooperated in translating it into Chinese, about 500,000 words. Although he had always been in favour of an unclear way of organizing academic work, he played a role in doing it seriously and responsibly. What we are seeing now, officially published since 1979, is based on the work of that time. At that time, entries on ethnicity were prepared by the teachers of the Central Institute for Nationalities and researchers from the Institute of Ethnic Studies. At the time of publication, many people, including fathers, had not been included in the list of staff members after the Cultural Revolution. The names of Professor Wu Wenzao and Professor Wu Zelin, who worked with him at that time, can still be seen in 'The Sea', but his name has been erased. \\nHe was assigned to the Department of Ethnographic History, Department of History in October 1961. When he completed a paper on the history of Shes, 'From Xu Rong to Shes', it is a pity that he wrote in June 1957, along with the 'Shemin's visit report in Zhejiang and Gan Provinces', he can't find now. From this time to the 'Cultural Revolution', he mainly did two things of great work. The first is to read and extract the national history data from ancient books, and the second is to translate Darwin's book 'The Origin of Humanity'. The first thing started as early as 1959, until 1964. He read all the '25 History' and 'General Study of Grants', circled the relevant national history materials, and then put on the card an excerpt from the history of history, 'left biography', 'national language', 'Warring State Policy', 'Kumitsuka Zhou Book', Bamboo Book, and some of the GGI Book. There are words on the card, writing out his own experience and opinions. From the end of May 1963 until 1964, in conjunction with the preparation of the 'Atlas of History of China', excerpt the ethnic history of the Ming History. This work of reading, lapping, excerpts is done in addition to many other work, meetings, political studies, and so on. This is by no means a simple work of information, but a fundamental step in a vast research effort. This work, combined with the focus research he has done, gradually has in his mind an overall picture of the development, change, movement, migration and the formation of the Chinese nation and the change in inter-ethnic relations in his mind. In conjunction with the teaching, he intends to start the topic 'Aerial View of the Situation of the First Qin Nationalities', expanding and enriching year by year, and may form a complete course after two or three years. Unfortunately, there is no opportunity for this work to the end. \\nFrom 1965 to May 1966, he focused as much time as possible on translating Darwin's original 'Origin of Humanity', nearly 800,000 words in full. As early as 1956, he started translating Darwin's classic work, because of the relationship between political movements and the work of the post, the contract with the scientific publishing community lapsed. In 1961, he once again proposed to business and in cooperation with Hu Shouwen to undertake translation. At that time, he wrote to Pan Naiku, saying, 'It was also done a useful thing.' Actually fulfilled his wish for many years. Professor Fei Xiaotong commented on his 'resilience for human governance,' said: 'How many scholars have been working for an academic job for a decade?' 'His character is the so-called cow leather band, is unyielding, pulling constantly, soft; tireless, inexhaustible, easy to achieve fruitful.' \\nThe Last Years in the Cultural Revolution\\nHe had only one leg, or asked him to go to the campus to pull grass, so he could not crouch down so he took a small stool and was kicked by the red guards, and he had to sit on the ground to pull the grass. \\nIn the Cultural Revolution, his father was used as a 'bourgeois reactionary authority' to criticize his home, and the study and bedroom were sealed. deprived of normal living conditions and forced to live on a concrete floor outside the kitchen, with a lack of bedding. He had only one leg. Although he was not allowed to go with Professor Fei Xiaotong and others to clean the toilet and bath room, he was asked to go to the campus to pull grass, he could not squat, so he could not crouch down so he was kicked and kicked by the red guards, and he had to sit on the ground to pull the grass. \\nBefore the Cultural Revolution, he had basic health, at which time he became ill, from prostatitis to uremia. There were no normal medical conditions at that time. My sister and I, Pan Nai-kang, were supervised 'gangsters' at Peking University, and had no freedom of movement and did not understand the situation at home. He was unable to consult him in a timely manner. When one of my classmates took him to the hospital, the doctor declared his illness. \\nAt this time I took leave to see him, and the doctor did not agree to stay with him. I could only take a temporary leave to see him. Pan Nai won't even take the leave. Not long, the hospital waged a war, and the attending doctors changed people. The medical care and care of such a serious illness became a problem, let alone rescue; instead, there were foreign investigators interrogating him beside the hospital bed, rushing him to yell and shaking the bed hard. In this case, he was determined to be discharged, and the doctor irresponsibly pushed him out of hospital. I'm helpless to pick him home. In this dying moment, the bedroom is not allowed to open, only open the house. We put an old march bed to let him sleep, finally lying in his own home, and can also drink a hot soup hot water. He died on 10 June 1967, when we were close to us, but we were unable to be with him. \\nIn 1980, all my father's problems were rehabilitated and a memorial service was held. In 1999, the NLD, the University for Nationalities and Tsinghua organized a symposium to mark his centennial birthday. In 2000, 14 volumes of Pan guangdan Collection were published by Peking University Press. There are still some unearning articles, we are finishing and seeking publication. \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 8"}

In dealing with the aftermath of the 'Tachan Rebellion', Pan requested to give gifts to more than 40 top people. The Provincial Committee approved that he could not send it, but he refused to carry out, returned 95 people, and even the rebels gave gifts and apologized. \\n(5), The policy of attacking and slandering the cadre of the provincial committee 'is to eat and open it steadily and actively do not eat'. 'No cadres in Qinghai have a high level, they do not necessarily have to be competent'. 'The policy of cadre in Qinghai is not suitable for attacking'. \\n(6), Pan is a pioneer of Sun Zuobin's consistent opposition party. The two are brothers and brothers. There is nothing to say, Pan can curse Sun 'shame your ancestors for eight lives'. Sun can also curse Pan 'shame your forefathers.' As early as 1947, under Sun's direction, Pan attacked comrade Li Hebang, secretary of the Longdong Land Committee at that time, slanded 'the Longdong Land Committee is a sectarianist group' and 'the secretary of the land and county committee are all Shaanxi North people'; in Gansu he supported Sun Zuobin defaming Zhang Desheng as 'embroidered pillows', 'smiling tiger', and Gao Jian Comrade Jun is 'insidious', 'ungrateful'; in the Northwest Bureau he agreed to slander Ma Wenrui, Comrade Li Jingying is' 'Sectarianism'; in Qinghai Sun said, 'There are many people from the provincial committee Standing Committee in Shaanxi North,' Pan Ta: 'Gao is the world of unity, others can't get started, no one else can eat food.' \\n(7), Oppose quelling the 'Dachan rebellion', slander us 'beating wrong, playing very miserable', 'the forces are very bad discipline, killing living Buddha and shooting the masses for no reason.' Claims that 'the local party and government should be responsible' and called for the removal of the chief of the Public Security Bureau and to kill the heads of several people in the army. \\n(8), oppose, slander and counteract, destroy the whole wind, anti-right. Pan claimed that his attitude towards counteraction policy was 'counterproductive, it can also be counterproductive' and said: 'There will certainly be no counteraction among people outside the party, do not do it today, and will not engage in the future. If you get outside the party, it is not a problem of rebellion, but a problem of rebellion'; he defamates the organs and rebellion is 'dismal.', 'cracked down on the motivation of cadres,' and openly reversed the case for historical counter-revolutionaries. At the beginning of the wind, he threatened to give him opinions and said, 'Opposing the leadership can also become the right', but also instigated and hashed a guarantee, saying, 'Give others an opinion uncertain to the right'; against the right, on the right, using the name of Zhong Hoon and Wang Feng, he said, 'Qinghai has opposed Ma Wending against Taiwan.' Son, he argued that 'sure, maybe it can,' and openly said: 'Rightists also have a future, and will be in a few years Become a party member, today's party members will also become right-wing elements in a few years.' Cadres are asked to 'treat right-wing elements with comrade-style relationships.' \\n(ix), Defending the interests of the exploitative class everywhere. It claims that 'working in the United Nations war is to eat by exploitative classes', 'National war work is the upper level work, and the central government does not have provisions for the work of the lower masses', and 'hundreds of households and pastoralists are all revolutionary leaders'. \\n(x), Political qualities are extremely bad. Always take despicable and downward means, crackdown on others to raise themselves, provoke alienation, create rumors, seal officers wish, buy and pull, and said shamelessly openly: 'I want is the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee', and asked Liu Jie to send a letter to Sun Zuobin, 'to raise my official one liter', and complained that Sun 'brought me to Qinghai' This is the end of this.' \\nSecond, the attitude in the struggle is extremely bad, and refuses to plead guilty. \\nThird, deal with opinions: classified as the right, dismissal of party membership, all posts. \\n[Compilation of Decisions on Purging the Right in the Party (IV)', Executive Office of the Central Committee of the CPC Central Committee, December 1959)\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 2"}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached] Su Min: 'Again, to make the self-revolution deep, and then deep-remember the mechanical faculty and staff meeting'\\nOver the past week, the faculty and staff of the whole department of machinery, inspired by the revolutionary slogan 'self-revolutionizing, burning yourself, giving hearts to the Party, striving for red through specialties', have made their hearts to the Party. Many old teachers who used to have two hearts about the Party, had a strong sense of political inferiority towards party members, had a strong sense of political inferiority to the Party. Some comrades who had made serious right-leaning mistakes before and after nudging, also boldly discouraged their concerns and surrendered their wrong political ideas. In many teaching rooms, Because everyone 'send watermelon', 'spit melon seeds', sincerely meet, open talk, long-standing disunity is Eliminate quickly. These new weather has greatly inspired the confidence and courage of my comrades to transform myself. In order to exchange experiences and enlighten each other, and to promote the whole self-revolutionary movement, the whole series of self-revolutionary exchanges will be held again on the afternoon of the 7th. \\nCommunist Party member Fan Ye played a pioneering role on the path of self-revolution. \\nCommunist Party member Fan Ye first brave to the masses, exposing many individualistic 'self-contained land' deep in his mind. She said: after 1956, the individualist ideas that struggle for treatment, enjoyment, status, and climb up have grown greatly. Having stayed to work as an assistant, I felt that the business was almost similar. Politically, they were party members, and they thought they were top-notch. In the classroom, there is a sense of pride and complacency, politically disregarded other teachers, teaching and feeling that they have nothing. Since family life has declined somewhat, we want to engage in 'underground factories' to pay jobs, take the Russian language tightly, want to engage in translating, publishing articles, writing fees. In treating comrades, serious selfishness and argroscopy ideas have also been revealed. \\nPolitical demands are weak and develop into right-leaning ideology and sympathy at the time of revelation. When it came up, I came up with the big print, so that party members should not fight back against false statements, not to counter criticism. When dealing with the right-wing member Pan jiahua Jia-Hua in the party, Pan jiahua said that I had stereotyped him, so I criticized him. I thought in my heart: 'Well, he will not necessarily be expelled, why should he offend others?' Not willing to fight again, he suggested to leave him with the party inspector for two years of punishment. \\nFan Ye's bold exposure, met with the masses sincerely, touched the old teachers of the storage and transport teaching department. They felt that the members of the Communist Party were willing to speak sincerely, and therefore all said the true words. The gap between party members and the masses has begun to disappear in the past. \\nTwo old teachers met sincerely, hand in hand with heart. \\nZhang Ying and Mr. Tang Kaysun, in the past were on the surface of a kind of gas, but secretly they looked down on each other, and even developed into each other's jealousy, intriguing point. At this congress they all broke their concerns, unveiled the lid and handed over these ugly thoughts. \\nMr. Zhang Ying said: under the control of arrogant ideology, feel that he can move closer to the Party and follow the party, so I can not look at Mr. Tang politically. I felt that he had read more than a few years in the past, studied with Soviet experts, from business and work, and thought that he was stronger than Mr. Tang, and wanted to show himself everywhere. In the graduation design, I had some topics to prove my scientific level, and one of the three topics was not even good for me. In the lecture, try to raise the status of the tubing class I lecture. In the teaching plan, Mr. Tang's oil depot classes obey me everywhere. As a result, a classmate wants to engage in tubing design, the assistant also wants to engage in tubing, and not willing to engage in the oil depot. In fact, Mr. Tang is stronger than me in some places (like lectures), but I deliberately keep myself from looking at his strengths'. \\nHe then talked about how the burden of progress he was carrying is a heavy impediment to self-transformation and awareness-raising. Mr. Zhang Ying said: 'His progress is in appearance, actually for the name. I have been applying for two years to join the party. I actually want to seek the title of a party member in order to obtain social status and political capital. Because of impurity of motivation, and not painstakingly transform yourself. Once after some social status (working people's representatives), was found, it was not willing to spend any more effort to get into the party. 'The idea of getting less and arrogant is in my progress.' \\nThen, Mr. Tong Kaysun also handed over to all comrades his ideological roots and development process of ununited with Mr. Zhang. Their statements were unanimously welcomed by everyone's warm applause, which encouraged them to take away the burdens of individualism and to move forward and to trust them in frankness, sincerity and solidarity. \\nXiao Chengzhong surrendered to the Party the right leaning and the ideological action of the loss of position\\nAt the meeting, Xiao Chengzhong, the Department of Mechanics, spoke deeply about his past wrong political attitude and a serious loss of position. 'My father and brother are rightists,' he said. I have always had two hearts with the Party in the past. The most prominent manifestation is that when the right party attacked the party, I used to shout and help them out for them. I actively participated in the publication of the vicious big print newspaper 'Hanging sheep heads and selling dog meat', painting President Yan wearing a small hat to stigmatize the leadership. After seeing the 'My worries and appeals' big print, I thought in mind: 'It is not blame that the Party Committee is not weak in the middle of the way. Originally, these conservatives have stepped from it. Having listened to Hao Junfang's speech, I would agree with his out-of-party Bolshevik argument, and take it to myself. I oppose criticism of the right-wing leader Shi Guangyun, believing that he does not have a whole set of reactionary views, and that the issue of communication is his own, and there is no need to criticize. I said, 'He is theoretically worthy of the right, not in fact. My brother was a far-right, and I was very much in agreement with his 'courage' to attack the party and wanted to write to encourage him. When anti-right, he felt that he might be the right, and he had to have a foresight, so let his brother report him, and mobilized him in the hope of alleviating his sin. He then talked about his thoughts in these two days, 'These ideas and actions, which have not been handed over in the past. Thought burdens are very heavy, afraid of punishment, fear of losing their face, and they do not dare to speak. But thinking of being a member of the Communist Youth League, should not be handed over to the party at this juncture of the self-revolution? Even if he was punished, it was for the interests of the revolution. After repeated and fierce struggles, it was only courageous to throw away personal considerations and surrender their hearts to the party.' \\nAt the end of the meeting, comrade Fang Huacan, party branch secretary, made a summary. He said: 'To make the heartfelt movement a step further, party members must lead by example and dig their minds hard. The slogan of our whole line is: follow up again, burn ourselves, burn others, burn others, burn the braised through.' Through the teachers, we get a lot of inspiration. People who have a distance from the two hearts of the Party in the past have seen from Tang Kai-sun's affiliation with Mr. Zhang Ying: to the Party, throw away the burden, strengthen confidence, and step up their self-transformation. This is the right path for thought leap forward. \\n(Beijing Institute of Petroleum, No. 40 1958, No. 40, April 10, 1958)"}

But if someone blame Peking University students by this, this is 'no target'. \\nWhat left socialism? \\nAnd who left socialism? \\nI see, it is dogmist, bureaucratic and sectarianist who left socialism, so Chairman Mao called on us to fire on them. \\nThe masses, the current mass movement, is moving forward along the way of socialism and growth. But the pace of progress has been slower and has almost stopped. \\nIt was the rhetoric of action that left socialist movement that stopped developing. \\nI use some examples to illustrate problems and arguments, some of which are heard or worthy. But the arguments to be explained are not just from these examples, so please don't think about them with me. 'Hear' and 'remember' may differ from the actual one, but it can still specify what I want to say. That's enough. \\nSome people fear others 'oppose socialism'. I want to state that dissatisfaction with reality is not necessarily anti-socialist, and those who have an ideal compare reality with their own ideals. It should be noted that anti-socialist enemies will not come to discuss what mistakes we have and why, today's enemies will not appear in the face of opposition parties. It is clear that the left-hand slogans have been used to suppress the masses to say that the party does not support the masses and build a new wall between the parties. will be much better for the enemy. \\nSituation estimates\\nOn May 24, 1957, 16:35 p.m. to 17:13, just after the delegation's congress passed its name changed to the Communist Youth League, the secretary of the Mission Central Committee received six members of my class. Since the delegation was very busy, he did not provide a specific analysis of the problems of our school. He spoke about the situation and gave some principled instructions. \\nThe secretary spoke first of all about 'home ownership'. 'It is difficult... difficult...' said the secretary: 'North Korea's Kim Il Sung, the Soviet Khrushchev head... Chinese Chairman Mao, I see, China's most difficult home-poor, backward, 60,000 people!' He said, 'We need to correct the error, and let the enemy not drill down. The secretary said that some people wanted Chairman Mao to step down, saying that if there was no chairman, there would be no need for the wind.' \\nThe secretary went on to say that our party had gone through a few big waves and made several big mistakes. \\nFor the first time, in 1927, the Great Revolution failed, the White Zone lost 100%, the Red Zone, and after the mutiny of the Kuomintang where Chairman Mao was located, Chairman Mao clipped with a parasol and ran in sight of Jinggang Mountain. \\nSecond, 1931-In 1935, the party changed from 300,000 to 50,000, left-leaning brought a huge disaster. \\nThe third time...\\nA silence, the secretary did not say it down...\\nChairman Mao initially proposed the wind was opposed by the overwhelming majority of senior cadres. Some people even withdrew from the venue. Everyone listened to the communication, needless to say. There are also legends that among our most familiar leaders are not in favor of (probably someone will say that I am rumored, I want me to indicate my name, very humble, I will ignore it)\\nWe listened to the accusations made by two Spanish students about the lawlessness caused by bureaucracy, and we were angry from the bottom of our hearts. However, this is by no means the darkest corner. It is conceivable that some of the victims have started to bake their fetters so far, some victims will remain in the madhouse forever, some have been with the Lord. Words, more left eternal trauma on the heart. \\nOur party had to promote a large number of cadres after the victory of the revolution. Because of their low level of culture and consciousness, they could go to the soup under the party's call, they would be powerless to leave the party's specific guidance; they don't understand policy, they will not analyze the problem; their ideology, leave socialism There are also two historical periods. \\nIt should be acknowledged that this group of cadres, under the leadership of the Party, destroyed the foundations of old society; they opened a new page in the history of our country. \\nHowever, they lacked the analytical power, they were unable to identify whether or not, and they laid down serious mistakes on issues that the party's instructions said could not be generalized. Among them, first and foremost, they hit what we intellectuals say most aspire: human dignity. 'Laozi participated in the revolution in 38 years when you were still eating milk, you-a stinky intellectuals.' \\nWe know that the idea of respect for human beings and human rights is born in capitalist societies, and it is no wonder that our old cadres cannot understand. \\nWhether you wish or not, as long as there are such cadres, there will be such a route. This awareness has even affected senior cadres and cadres of intellectuals. \\nFor a month, a region, no mistake is a miracle; there will be one thing, a case, no deviation and strange thing. The universality of the problem would then be conceivable. In this way, it is not surprising to encounter special examples, even a few. \\nThe Central Committee estimated the situation, and determined to rectify its mistakes resolutely, and to protect the Party's good cadres. It should be vigorously magnified to allow the entire people to participate in the political life of the country, and also to prevent the enemy from taking advantage of the opportunity to destroy. \\n... hard... hard... hard...\\nMethod of wind\\nThe Party Central Committee knows more than anyone: fully engage the masses. Under the supervision of the masses, the wind can be done well, and the three hazards can be cleared. \\nWe are superstitious to the masses, the masses are the driving forces of society. On the basis of full mobilization by the masses, things that violate the interests of the masses cannot occur, and leaders who violate the interests of the masses will not survive. \\nGiven the special circumstances of our country, we cannot zoom in at once throughout the country. The cadre level is low, they cannot understand, and they cannot correct the error. The level of the masses is also low, it will not identify whether or not. In case a group of people hinges up, the result will be good for us. \\nSo, the Party Central Committee took a steady approach: wind and rain, top-down, slowly. Leading by the superior, correcting mistakes and solving problems of thought, within a few years, achieve the goal of truly fully activating the masses and the people's real ownership. \\nIf the 'situation' in front of me is basically right, then the whole wind does do this way. \\nThe problem should be addressed throughout the country in a longer period of history. If the time is the transverse coordinate, the mass launch situation is ordinate, the resulting result will be a... curve (omitted)...\\nHowever, actual processes are not necessarily the same everywhere. For example, the pace of development in schools is not necessarily at the same pace as the national level. \\nThe above mentioned national conditions are not established in schools, we have strong party committee leadership, and our masses also have sufficient analytical ability to identify the enemy. So I think the school can and should be fully 'put'. As shown below (omitted). \\nIt would be useful for us to involve the people of such analysis in the political life of our country first. \\nIn fact, this is also happening in our school. The classmates ran to the front of the party and also greatly went beyond the scope of the Party Committee's original intention. \\nHow many years of dogmatic bondage has been swept away, and the masses have been liberated in their minds. Right or, not right or, come out to the sun to see, the past right, wrong, as long as different from the 'people' xx in the dark corner listening to its moldy, rotting era is gone. \\nWe have seen that a popular campaign, launched spontaneously by the majority of classmates, has removed the consequences of the inflexible mind caused by years of misguided education methods. I think that this means the beginning of real ownership by the masses, which means that our society will always go forward, and I agree with one of my classmates that, in a sense, the great significance of this movement is comparable to the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. \\nI can't help but cheer: Long live the mass movement! \\nThere is still a need to actively and clearly support the revelation\\nThe Party Committee has repeatedly declared its support for the liberation, and repeatedly assured that there will be determination to put it in the end. \\nThe actual situation is that the party committee dragged behind the mass movement and was pulled away by the masses movement. \\nAt first, vice-secretary Cui's Lamb, President Jiang, came out to declare his support for the big print newspaper. Just say it verbally, and then look at you 'nooze', 'let them get enough', ignore anyway, and if there is a right opinion, the wrong even number. \\nSilence, the masses will automatically stop, the masses will be tired, indeed, the first orgasm has passed. \\nHispanic complaints will let naive classmates see the dark side of society and arouse masses resentment of the three harm. When everyone was about to move, vice-president Jiang, secretary of the Party Committee, who silenced for six days in the climax of the masses of growing sentiment, ran away from the complaint meeting, arguing that students of the Spanish language department should not take foreign affairs to the school, are complaining against the Party and are opposing socialism. The next day at 5:30 a.m., called all party members, unified thinking...\\nOh, my God, what is this? Let's take a look at the effect of President Jiang's speech. I heard a classmate who complained to the party that he was ready for everything! How painful the truth! It should be said that this is more terrible than handcuffed fetters. \\nPresident Jiang's speech was suppressing the masses, and the masses were not able to rise up against them due to preparations at the level. \\nWill the complaint really not apply? Will the last complaint really have a bad effect? \\nNot necessarily, not for me. It enabled me to understand the situation, understand the 'difficult ah' of the secretary of the regiment central committee, and thus appreciated the Party's policy. But the party committee consciously stopped it without giving it a greater positive effect. \\nThe complaint will be changed from a pre-fasting space to the auditorium, presumably not to support or value it, but want to reduce its impact at the time? Otherwise why do not connect the amplifier, why say the machine with no move but can connect two classroom speakers? \\nThe speech by Zhao Zhenjiang, Chairman of the Student Union, is not clearly distracting the eyes of the masses? Of course, we have to get these two things out of the water, but, the Chairman, when there are two cases in the world? Don't you know what you care about is more of this kind of thing, is to make things like this not happen again? \\nPresident Jiang did not hear the complaint, that is, bite a bite: 'Complaint the Party'! 'Against Socialism'! I see, no one other than President Jiang believes that these two comrades are complaining against the Party, and no one other than President Jiang believes that the Party has a 'inevitable' link between these things. \\nThe two of our comrades were calm enough, and I believe I wouldn't have done it if I were them. \\nIndividual questions are not properly asked, such as which ruling group in history killed the most people after coming to power, is easy to answer. We do not understand the old social situation, and we thought that more than 700,000 would have to be. In fact, the Kuomintang killed much more. Under the guidance policy of 'rather killing a thousand, you can't put one', there are really countless sacrifices-simply can't count, numbered jailed, numbered executions...\\nThese issues should be clarified, but none of them has been done. \\nI think I can open a complaint meeting. \\nThe party committee should personally lead the complaint meeting. \\nComplaints can play a huge role in two ways. First, he called on the masses to fight against the three victimization. He let all those who have a sense of justice to participate in the fight. Many of our naive classmates have suffered from past dogmist ideological education. To this day, it is ridiculous, thinking that what the newspaper saw is everything, they have nothing. Law understands the complexity of social phenomena, and they are even less able to understand why the three hazards must be eliminated. And why should we use the way we are doing now, (obviously, illegal and discipline is caused by three harm. Without bureaucracy, sectarianism, dogmatism, there will be no illegal and disciplined phenomenon. Two comrades have not gone to the Party Central Committee, the People's Congress, the Public Security Department, etc.), \\nSecondly, in order to dispel the concerns of the victims, the support of the masses will give them unparalleled courage. \\nWill there be side effects? The party itself came to lead, able to eliminate that. I also embrace the attitude of letting everyone know the facts and facts. We explain some of the issues, so that everyone feels that the Party is launching the masses and leading the masses to eliminate the three harm, then it will eliminate the divides in the party group, and more demonstrate the Party's determination to rectify the winds. \\nObjection to the complaint will, I understand to be afraid of the complaints, you yourself combine yourself with what people are complaining about, and you yourself oppose yourself to the demands of the masses. Things have been done wrong, come out to make up for the damage that has been caused. \\nI sincerely ask the Party Committee to change the current situation, starting with the complaint meeting convened by the Party Committee, to stand at the forefront of the mass movement and lead us forward. \\nIs the party closing? Whether you acknowledge or not, the masses in the mass movement will say, 'Yes.' \\nThat is, is the repeated guarantee of the party committee is false words? And not necessarily. \\nThe Party Committee said that it was according to the instructions of the Central Committee, the Central Committee clearly wanted to put it firmly, and it was also clearly determined to put it in the end. The party committee refers to this in terms. \\nHowever, it is true that the Party Committee itself does not know how to put it. At the beginning, the situation at Peking University was greatly unexpected. Don't know at all? No, there is such an ideal model nationwide, as we said earlier. Our party committee, originally intended to move this ideal model to our school. Who knows that from the beginning it was derailed, Peking University was quite good. The Party Committee finally recognized the legal status of the big print newspaper (some units were not), and when the complaint would express opposition, it still used organizational force and did not publicly declare illegal. \\nThat is, the party committee had conceived such an ideal model and always wanted to include the mass movement into this movement. For our school, the track of this ideal model is to abandon the mass movement and cancel everything that has been achieved in the mass movement (which can only bury a batch of seeds). Everything from the Party Committee said that all practical actions are 'struggling' for this purpose. \\nWhat is 'Support Big Picture'? President Ma Xianfu made it clear-we would prefer to use the form of a colloquium (author's note: 'We are against using other forms'), but there is no objection if we are willing to use other means (note: 'cannot be prohibited'). \\nWhy do not sound for a long time? Why don't the party come out to lead the mass movement? So many comrades have asked the party leadership, why did the Party Committee ignore it? The reason is that it doesn't approve (or not, I think almost), to do so, of course, it is impossible to lead. It is clear that the masses will have a low tide for a long time, and they will be self-extinct. When the complaint is about to rise to a second climax, the Party Committee pushed down with organizational strength (organizational strength is used right is progress and bad, it is also particularly destructive!), \\nThe school committee passed a resolution, and everything went as usual, and it was also necessary to close the examination of politics... isn't it obvious-to bring the mass movement down. \\nIn fact, it has collapsed, some faculty exams have suddenly reinstated (whether intentionally or unintentionally, at least not intentionally to let students participate in activities), originally considered subjects that could not be tested again... in fact, how could not collapse? \\nI would have to study after writing this article myself. I originally intended to talk about some questions, but I had to say it later, otherwise how to do the exam? \\nThe symposium, in-depth... that is deceiving children, there is no basis for mass movement. These are nonsense-look at the actual situation! More than 80% of the original classmates in our class moved up, and everyone asked the party branch to meet, and now, the party branch wants to pull people out. \\nThe party can't control the executive... who is deceiving? The principal of the real director is not party secretary? Do not have party members and party committee members at all levels of administrative cadres? Not too few party committee members on the school committee! Does anyone believe that if the party committee proposes to suspend classes old will come out against it? \\n...\\nIt makes sense, open the skylight to speak, we will understand you, is not sneaky to hide. Note that you are throwing away the real good youth, you are sweeping yourself in the masses, and you are throwing yourself a little fitting hat that is afraid of the masses. Note that you are deepening the concerns of those who have concerns, and you draw a deep ditch that cannot be passed through between yourself and the masses (some party members declare, just because of organizational relationships, they can't speak). Note that you are using a dogmatic attitude 'anti-dogmatic', with bureaucratic attitude 'anti-bureaucratic', sectarianism 'anti-sectarianism'! \\nIf it goes like this (I believe it will not, but really have to wait for Chairman Mao to order it?), , then, one day, the masses will act according to their own will. The pace of history will always move forward with the will of the people, and the masses, they are at no cost. \\nI still sincerely hope that you will wake up and join the movement and lead us forward. \\nWhat to do?
