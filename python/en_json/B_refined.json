Due to the impure motive to join the party and can not stand the test of the party, the same year, it automatically leaves Rejoined the party in December 1938. Former editor of Jincha-Ji Daily, Northeast Railway Bureau factory minister, Dalian railway factory deputy director, currently deputy dean of Tangshan Railway Institute, party committee member. \\nIn its nearly 20 years of work history, Bai Iron Rock proves from many major issues that he is an extremist individualist of the bourgeois, fame and fame, exercised parental rule in leadership style, brutality, and consistently violates the party's policy and is dissatisfied with the party. \\nDuring the anti-US aid to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 1950, Bai Tie-Yan was the Minister of Factory Affairs of the Northeast Railway Administration, leaked military secrets to his brother-in-law American spy Yu Baolian, causing great damage to the Party and the people. During the three-counter-period, it also showed serious liberalism and resistance movement. At that time, the Northeastern Bureau of the CPC Central Committee asked the leaders of the various units to get the three anti-back movements done well, otherwise they should be dismissed from office. Bai said publicly, 'This is a person who scare the nervous weakness.' Was suspended for a week for reflection. When he was deputy director of the Dalian Railway Plant, he destroyed the state financial system, falsely reported results and ununited. It was publicly criticized by the Dalian Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China in the Party Newspaper. Baitirock has been dissatisfied with this. Before and after this whole wind movement, the white iron rock attacked the party against the people, mainly the following facts:\\n1. To publicly incite the masses on the issue of building schools at Tangshan Railway Institute, directing fire to the Central Committee, trying to use mass pressure to oppose the Central Committee's decision to expand the Tangshan Railway Institute in Tangshan, and fabricate facts to Minister Teng to write a letter to Minister Teng in an attempt to threaten, and at the same time to make a seditious report to the students: 'The problem of building schools is not no school. It is the bureaucracy of the superior.' 'You can see the organization of a delegation or a reporting mission to the Central Committee.' and attempted to agree to the student's request to suspend classes, discuss the issue of building schools, and put forward three programmatic anti-party proposals in the trade union committee: first, the problem of building schools is a meticulous and hard struggle; secondly, clear objectives; and thirdly, the establishment of organizational structures and research, Accelerate the resolution of school construction problems. The reactionary 'School Promotion Committee' and a delegation in Beijing were set up under the influence of the planning and incitement of Bai tieyan and other right-wing elements, and put on the walls of the College the reactionary slogans such as 'Recovery of Lost Land', 'Return to Garden Road', 'Against Chronic Assassination of Tang Yuan by Ministry of Railways and Ministry of Higher Education'. Become an anti-party and anti-socialist arrogance. From many factual analysis, the white iron rock is a long plan, systematic and purposeful use of various means to try to overthrow the Central Committee's decision on the expansion of the Tang Yuan in Tangshan, in order to achieve his bourgeois individualistic desire, and to make the masses dissatisfied with the Party and the policy of the State. Anti-central vicious behavior. \\n2, negate the party's leadership of higher schools and oppose the school's policy of opening doors to workers and farmers. Bai Iron Rock has openly spread that 'there are problems with the party committee system in higher schools is not necessarily', and spread reactionary fallacies such as 'laymen cannot lead the interior,' hate workers and farmers cadres and do not care about learning from workers and farmers. Its essence is an attempt to push the party and the workers and agricultural cadres out of their doors. \\n3, oppose the democratic centralization system and distort the party's policy. Bai Tiyan believes that Chairman Mao's ten guidelines are not relevant to schools and oppose in-depth learning and implementation. I think that there is a problem with the policy of cadres in the Ministry of Railways, and that cadres do not Distorted the party's 'anti-counter' policy at student colloquium during the colloquium, saying: 'In the past period of red flag policy, it was dozens of hundreds,' and when giving a study report to the graduation class 'then on the history of proletarian dictatorship', slandered the history of the party and said: 'In the past, the Party does not know unity-criticism-unity.', the dismissal of Chen Duxiu and Zhang Guotao, now seems unnecessary.' And so on. \\n4. Defame the leadership cadres of the Ministry of Railways, defy the leaders of the Tangshan Municipal Committee and Lanzhou Municipal Committee, spread dissatisfaction with the college party committee and other comrades, and undermine the unity of the Party. \\n5, Bai iron rock also lost the moral qualities of communism and always play with women: in 1952, the white iron rock used power and status to play with two female staff under his leadership; during the work of the college, Bai iron rock as deputy president of higher school (then acting dean), party committee members, disregarding the party The influence of a female student, especially in this rectifying check with The girl wrote to deceive the girl to say that he had left school (actually he was doing an anti-party check), and asked to maintain such unfair relations without communicating to the party, a quality that the party could not tolerate. \\nOver the past six months, the party and outside the party have repeatedly exposed and criticized the anti-socialist crimes against the Bai tieyan. The white iron rock was not thoroughly examined and accounted for. Until the branch assembly discussed its disciplinary action, the party was still not honest, and the loss of the moral character of communism was still concealed. For 20 years, Bai tieyan has consistently rejected the party's education, insisting on mistakes, so that the right-wing elements who eventually fell into the bourgeois have become party traitors and enemies. In order to clean the party's organization, the Party Committee agreed to the decision of the branch to dismiss the party's membership and recommended that the superior leaders remove all their administrative duties.

On May 9, according to the Party Central Committee and Tangshan Municipal Committee's instructions on the winding movement, decided to start in the college from mid-May to carry out the wind movement. A plan has been drawn up to carry out the wind movement. In order to strengthen the specific leadership of the whole wind movement, the college set up a five-member guidance group under the leadership of the Party Committee. Since Comrade Gu Xi, Party Secretary and President of the Party Committee, Comrade Gu Xi went to Beijing Central High Party School in August 1956. Long. The Steering Group is headed by the Office of the Breeze Movement. \\nOn May 18, the party secretary of the House Committee Yu Zhongyou to the whole hospital's staff and teachers, the report spells out the purpose requirements, guiding ideas, guidelines, methods and specific arrangements to mobilize all teachers, students and staff to help the party rectify the wind. Leaders at all levels and members of the Communist Party are required to listen to the opinions of the masses, carry out criticism and self-criticism, improve their working style and make good winds. The whole wind movement was carried out in our hospital. \\nFirstly, organize the whole school teacher and student staff study documents, raise awareness, make comments and suggestions on the work of the party. The Party Committee and the Administration of the Academy have held a symposium on student representatives, heads of departments, heads of departments, heads of various democratic parties, as well as a symposium on mid-level cadres and staff representatives to listen to all aspects of the school's work, and we put forward a lot of opinions and suggestions through learning documents. Help the party to rectify. From May 23 to 25, the CPC Tangshan Municipal Committee invited our college professors, lecturers and assistants to hold more than 20 talks, solicit opinions on the leadership of the municipal committee and college party committee. The symposium held three afternoons, all presided over by Comrade Liu Hansheng, the first secretary of the Tangshan Municipal Committee. Through the big magnification and various symposia, everyone speaks freely, the views presented mainly have the following aspects:\\n(1), on the construction of schools; (2), on college leadership issues; (3), on leadership and cadres; (4), party-non-party relations and intellectuals have no right to work; (5), on the promotion of school good traditions, etc. And everyone has the most opinion, the biggest opinion is the problem of building schools. \\nOver the years, due to the long outstanding problem of school construction, which has seriously affected the teaching, scientific research work and the development of schools, everyone's views are more focused on the problem of building schools, hoping to give opinions through the wind, and promote leadership attention, with a view to resolving the school site problem at an early date. On May 25, the CPC leadership group recommended that the house trade unions organize the mass discussion on the issue of school construction. The New Tang Hospital newspaper and the various departments of the blackboard also discussed school construction issues. On May 31, the School Trade Union convened a meeting of the Provisional Trade Union Committee to discuss how to promote school construction. In their statements, the members of the meeting suggested that the issue of building schools is the outstanding contradiction and the 'key to survival' of our school. The current task is to actively promote this work. To this end, the Trade Union Committee recommends that the party and government of schools, democratic parties, the Communist Youth League, student unions and trade unions organize a body of action to promote the right, decision-making and action of schools in order to unify views and focus on the promotion of school construction. This body includes the Planning and Study Group, the Investigative Group, the Communications Liaison Group and the Office. Prior to the establishment of the organization, trade unions had temporarily formed a temporary body in order to secure time. The meeting also decided to immediately take telegrams to the People's Daily, Guangming Daily and Wen Wei Bao, and invited them to send reporters to our school to learn about the situation. \\nOn the afternoon of June 5, 1957, the school held an extended meeting to discuss school construction issues. Reporters from newspapers such as Guangming Daily, Hebei Daily and Tangshan Labor Daily attended the meeting. A total of more than 300 representatives of teachers, staff and students attended the conference. In keeping with their attitude of responsibility for school development, delegates have suggested that the problem of school site be resolved as soon as possible. Many teachers cited examples of school reputation, quality of teaching and staff emotions affected because of the problem of the school site. Most of the teachers hoped that the school could move to Beijing. In their speeches, some teachers criticized the bureaucracy of the higher authorities, and proposed the establishment of a school promotion committee, formed a delegation to Beijing, and directly to the leadership of the Ministry of Railways to reflect the problems of our school in order to solve the problem of relocating our school as soon as possible. \\nThe meeting was conducted in a warm atmosphere, and the majority of teachers and students sincerely hope to speed up the solution of the school site problem through this time, speed up the pace of school development, and build the school into the first class university in the country as soon as possible. The seminar had been held for an afternoon, but it was still felt unfulfilled, and the moderator announced that the meeting would continue after dinner. More than 7 o'clock in the evening, the sky fell under light rain, and people gathered from all sides to Ming Cheng Hall. There were a lot of people attending the meeting at night, and the mingcheng hall upstairs and the entrance were crowded with listeners. After a warm discussion, the members of the College Promotion Committee were elected on the spot, the chairman, deputy director and related candidates were elected. A draft resolution for the Expanded Council was prepared. The meeting ended at 11.30 p.m. At this time, not only are there no seats inside the Ming Cheng Tang, but the door is overcrowded, that is, the outside window is also crowded with teachers and students. They listened to and watched, and placed their care and expectations for the future of the school. \\nOn June 10, 'Tangshan Railway Institute School Promotion Committee' formulated the 'Submission to the State Council, Ministry of Railways and Ministry of Higher Education (Draft)'. \\nOn the 14th, the School Promotion Committee issued four resolutions: (a), send six professors (Wang Deng, Guo Kezhan, Sun Zhusheng, etc.), to Beijing to reflect the situation and ask leaders to come to the hospital to understand the situation; (2), to book Premier Zhou Enlai to reflect the school situation; (3), ask the party committee to clarify the past and present to build schools The view; (four), hope that the wind, work is not wrong. A nationwide anti-right struggle began when teachers and students of the whole school were full of wonderful vision for the future of the school, waiting for the leaders concerned to solve the problem of relocating our school as soon as possible. \\nThroughout the country, the masses of all walks of life have been widely launched, and there has been a situation of controversy in enlightened politics. People believe in the sincerity of the party and the government, with good faith, pointed out with goodwill the disadvantages of the management style and policy strategy that affect the people and people in politics. The movement of the wind has developed smoothly, and senior intellectual elites and politics Association minority democratic parties are more about the national system of government, state policy, and philosophical theory, etc. The field has made bold comments and suggestions, and this situation has aroused Mao Zedong's great alertness and disgust. \\nOn May 15, 1957, Mao Zedong wrote the article 'Things are changing', and he warned the whole party that in the recent period, in the Democratic Party's middle and higher schools, the right were the most resolute and rampant. They thought the centrist were their people and would not walk with the Communist Party. For the first time, the right-wing claim was made to the crowd in the text, asking to recognize the situation of class struggles and pay attention to the attacks of the right. On June 8, the CPC Central Committee issued an instruction drawn up by Comrade Mao Zedong on organizing forces to counter attacks by right-wing elements, demanding that party committees at all levels immediately respond to the right. On the same day, the People's Daily published an editorial 'Why That Is Why' further stated: 'In the name of helping the Communist Party to rectify, the minority of the right challenged the leadership of the Communist Party and the working class. They attempted to overthrow the Communist Party and the working-class, the great cause of socialism, take history backwards to the bourgeois dictatorship. But they forget that China today is no longer the former China. If history is to go back, the widest people will never allow it.' \\nIn mid-June, Comrade Gu Xi, secretary and president of the school party committee, was returned to school from Beijing Central Party School. \\nOn June 24, the House Party Committee convened an emergency meeting to study Comrade Mao Zedong's 'About Correct Handling Problems of People's Internal Contradictions' (People's Daily published on June 19), discuss anti-right struggles and further embed issues. On the same day, a whole school conference was held. Deputy Secretary of the School Party Committee Yu Zhongyou made a report on behalf of the Party Committee and mobilized an anti-right struggle in the whole hospital. \\nOn July 14, our hospital held the fifth Council Committee to discuss the issue of relocating schools. It was felt that the establishment of a school promotion committee had been erroneous and that the organization should be abolished. Vice Dean of Baitezite examined his mistakes in building schools some time ago. Finally, the Conference resulted in the Resolution on the Construction of Schools: Immediately abolish the School Promotion Committee. With regard to the construction of schools, in the future, the Council Committee will continue to rely closely on the Party's leadership under the principle of subordination of local interests to the overall national interests, fully reflect the correct opinions of the masses, actively study the problem of building schools and seek a reasonable solution to the problem of building schools as soon as possible. \\nOn July 15, the whole house held a conference on the struggle against the right to defend the socialist anti-right, which set the height of the anti-right struggle in our hospital. The college leadership decided that teachers and staff of the whole college would not leave the summer vacation. In September, the whole school was suspended for one month and focused on fighting against the right. \\nFrom mid-July to the end of October, the entire hospital, departments and units called and reported criticism of dozens of teachers, employees and students, including nearly 20 graduates. The criticism is basically excerpt from their statements at various colloquiums, raising their views and opinions on school work, school leadership style, school building issues to a high level of 'anti-party, anti-socialism'. Many well-intentioned and relevant criticisms and proposals were seen as right-wing rhetoric, and the authors of those statements were treated with extreme injustice. Criticism made by comrades in particular regarding the construction of schools was regarded as the leader of the opposition party and classified as the right. In this fight, a total of 72 cadres, teachers and students, including deputy dean of white iron rock, were classified as right-wing elements, accounting for 2.22% of the total number of 3234 participants in the movement at that time. Of these, 25 were classified as far-right, accounting for 34.72 per cent of the total number of right-wing elements. Of the 64 professors and associate professors, 6 were classified as right-wing, 9.37 per cent; 11 of lecturers and assistants, representing 2.77 per cent of the total number; 13 out of 362 staff were classified as right-wing, representing 3.58 per cent of their total number; and 40 out of 1659 students classified as right-wing elements, accounting for 1.65 per cent of their total number. \\nSubsequently, the 72 cadres, teachers and students were subjected to severe treatment, depending on their speech and personal history, respectively, downgraded by three levels, dismissal from office, supervision of labor, repatriation to rural areas, until arrest and justice. Thereafter, they lost their physical and mental freedom and human dignity, and embarked on a long and despicable manner. The path of suffering and humiliation. Many of the cadres, teachers and students classified as right-wing elements are professors and academics who have made outstanding contributions in the teaching and scientific research of the country. They had to endure great humiliation and misunderstandings in that bitter age and special political context. Many of them are now ancient. We don't know what they think about that year, nor can they experience their bitterness and puzzling, but after another impact on them, the Cultural Revolution, and later in their work, we can see their loyalty and happiness in the cause of education. Ingenuity. \\n24 years later, in June 1981, the Sixth Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the CPC Central Committee passed the Resolution on the History of the Party since the founding of the State, making a conclusive statement on the fight against the right. After the 11th Central Committee of the 3rd Plenary Session of the Party, our school reviewed the right-wing elements identified in that year, and believed that they were all misguided, and implemented the relevant policies. The stormy movement has been forgotten in memory as the years disappear, but the lessons left are profound. The expansion of the struggle against the right has departed from the demand for expanding socialist democracy, thwarted a significant part of the people's motivation to build socialism, thus delaying the historical process of building socialist democracy and the rule of law in China. This is a painful history in the political life of the country after the establishment of the new China. Lessons. \\n"},

A lot of people are new, think that they have entered a new era. At the same time, the Central Committee issued a call to 'advance into science', requiring relevant departments and units to prepare a '12-year scientific plan'. Individuals should also propose their own plans.

Themes, movement and so on, he speaks relish, we listen to cloud mountain fog cover, but anyway, still played a certain enlightenment for us. \\nIn addition, films screened in off-campus cinemas also show foreign films other than Soviet films, such as the Indian film 'The Wanderer', the Mexican film 'The Right to Feast', and the Argentine film 'The Center Dies Before Dawn' were popular among audiences. \\nBefore the end of the year, teachers of the Beijing Central Conservatory of Music led students to our school for graduation internships. The performance was held in Mingcheng Hall, with unprecedented success. It seems that instructor Mai gave us lectures, came in handy. The vocal professor of the school, director of the vocal vocal department, famous soprano Yu Yixuan, sang a song 'Kangding Love Song', causing the whole sensation. Student performances, vocal programs include male, female solo, male and female mixed quartet, male and female mixed chorus, instrumental programs, violin solo, viola solo, flute solo, piano solo, string quartet, piano trio, etc. All won a warm applause, and the costumes are gorgeous and the typhoon is beautiful. This is my first concert to watch Western music. Leave an unforgettable impression. \\nOn the eve of the New Year, the school held a New Year's costume party. Students dressed in colorful minority costumes and danced with the cheerful songs. Some of the young teachers also came to attend, but they did not have a costume. My classmates from Saigon dressed up as a Tibetan girl wearing a suede caps and a cross-grain apron. I dressed as a girl with a lot of small braids, wearing a small hat, a girl of the Xinjiang Uygur. Welcome the New Year in a warm and joyful atmosphere. \\nII. THEME\\nStarting in spring 1957, the last semester of our year, originally scheduled from mid-February to finish in mid-June, leaving the last month, leaving the final month, graduation appraisal, and graduation assignment, leaving school in mid-July. The content of the graduation design is that each individual independently performs the design of a medium bridge, from initial design to technical design to construction design, including writing a design manual, drawing up design drawings, preparing budget estimates and setting out the overall project schedule, etc. During the last semester of the bridge course, although it was also designed for bridges, it was only partial, smaller bridge design, not so much work, and there was no need for a reply. Graduation design content, large workload, time tight, students all day and night, put into the work of graduation design. Just as we began to invest in the design of graduation, the political situation has begun to change. The Party Central Committee has proposed that the National People help the Party 'rectify the wind' and demand a great 'Ming' and 'amplify'. It is not only the 'Ming' and 'put' of the 'flowers in all the blossoms in the field of culture, art and science.' It is the 'song' of the political 'uneven and singing', and 'put' of 'gas to put'. Although the Party Central Committee encourages people to 'daring, boldly put', 'speak without words, endless words. The speakers' innocence, hears their feet.' \\nBut the reaction was not enthusiastic, and quite a lot of people still have doubts about whether the party will actually practice 'speakers' innocence', whether they will 'account after the fall' and so on. The sociologist Fei Xiaotong of the Central Institute for Nationalities first published in the People's Daily in March entitled 'Intellectuals early spring weather', which revealed the psychological situation of most intellectuals: 'Hearts are hot, but their mouth is tight... fear is a trap, collect some thoughts, and so on when you come to a sport. A whole whole'. In April, Peking University historian Qian Bozan published a short article about the attitude of most intellectuals to the central call: 'They are still speculating whether this is true or false. If it is really put, put how much, put it after not receive, put is the means or purpose.' Wang Zaoshi, professor of Fudan University of Shanghai, said in a speech to the Guangming Daily reporter: 'I hope that the central government will issue a more specific statement to ensure that, except the current counter-revolutionaries, all thought issues are not pursued.' Talking about why people do not want to shine, Tang's poetry, 'with lust to say something in the palace, parrots do not dare to say', giving the voice of most intellectuals. \\nIn the previous phase of the call for revelation, we worked intensively to design graduation. We did not pay much attention to the issue, but from the first Zhang Ming magnification newspaper of Peking University posted on May 19, it is in the climax stage. The People's Daily contains the various democratic parties, literary and academic circles. The remarks at the symposium only attracted attention, among which the more prominent are, the Minister of Transport Zhang Bojun, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC and vice chairman of the NLD, said: 'There are many design institutes in industry, but many facilities in politics, there is no design institute. I see the CPPCC, the People's Congress, democratic parties, and people's groups, should be political design institutes... Some political infrastructure should be in advance. Give them a discussion.' It was later called the 'Institute of Political Design'. \\nLorongji, Minister of Forest Industry and Vice Chairman of the NLD of the State Council, advocated that a committee be set up by the NPC and the CPPCC, and proposed that such committees be set up throughout the country to form a system for the people who have been wronged in every movement. It was later referred to as the 'rehabilitation commission'. \\nLong Yun, vice-chairman of the National Defense Commission of the People's Republic of China and vice-chairman of the People's Republic of China National Revolution, said 'China's resistance triumphs, and Japan surrenders. The Soviet Union sent troops to the Northeast, and moved the Northeast of the two billion US dollars worth of machines and materials to the Soviet Union. So far it has not been returned, how is it considered a friendly and fraternal country?' 'The Korean War was directed by the Soviet Union to launch North Korea. Instead, China is to fight against the US and North Korea, and the weapons used are exchanged with Chinese materials, especially food, to the Soviet Union. All war costs are borne by China, is it fair and reasonable?' \\n'I think the party leadership of the country is not equal to this country is party owned.' However, nationwide, large and small units, or even a branch, a group have to arrange a party member to be the head... is the party to do so is it the idea of the 'universal, mofe-kingdom', thus forming such a situation as a whole world...' later summarizes his remarks. For the 'party world'. \\nThe playwright Wu Zu-guang published an article entitled 'Party 'Don't lead the art work sooner' in the 'Drama newspaper', which says: 'The executive leadership is watching the play, slightly unhappy, the artist will go back to change.' 'Everything is decided by leadership, and even every artistic processing, script changes are made according to the leadership's intent.' 'The leaders of countless art groups today do not estimate the needs of the people and believe that the masses are ignorant. To the masses love things, use countless rules and precepts to kill.' 'If the party must lead this way, who led Qu Yuan in the past? Who leads Li Bai, Du Fu, Guan Hanqing, Cao Xueqin, Lu Xun? Who led Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Beethoven, Moriere?' \\nTan Tiwu, Standing Committee of the Women's Central Committee of the Democratic and Leather Women's Central Committee, spoke at the Mingfang meeting, criticizing the Communist Party for taking the lead in violating the Constitution, pointing out that 'the Communist Party must abide by the Constitution, and should not issue internal instructions outside laws or decrees. It is not possible to replace laws and decrees with instructions...'\\nLin Xiling, a female student from Renmin University of China, made her point at a debate at Peking University: 'I think our socialism is not real socialism, real socialism should be very democratic, but we are not democratic here. We call this society on feudal basis. Generated socialism, we want to fight for a real socialism...' \\nIn the interval between graduating design, some of these remarks were seen from the People's Daily, which was ordered in the class, some felt novel, and some felt that it was not unreasonable. Because he did not have any mature political opinion at that time. When I went to the school canteen for dinner, we watched the large print papers posted in the canteen, but most of them were dissatisfied with specific cases. One of the most focused opinions is the problem of school relocation, the long-term uncertainty of the new school site has affected the development of schools. So some people proposed to set up a school construction committee to promote the solution of school construction problems. The School Building Promotion Committee, composed of representatives of professors and students, was elected, and a delegation of more than 10 people was elected to Beijing to submit written opinions directly to the leadership of the Ministry of Railways. The delegation returned to school a few days after going to Beijing, taking the history of the delegation's petition to the Ministry of Railways in the form of a large print newspaper. It was announced that the Ministry of Railways did not take care of it at the beginning. Later it had to be received by Deputy Minister of Railways Liu Jianzhang. However, Deputy Minister Liu did not listen to the legitimate requests of the members of the delegation. Instead, he sent the delegation back to Tangshan without trying to resolve the problem. After this big print newspaper was posted, a time when they were angry, many big print newspapers targeting Liu Jianzhang were posted in the cafeteria. On the wall of our drawing room for graduation design, there are also students posting some small print papers to shine, and also have expressed different views. But not impressed me. Most classmates, mainly invested in graduation design, writing small lettering very few. \\nThe People's Daily, which was scheduled for a watch class, is mostly taken to pay attention to the development of the movement, but also do not comment. By the beginning of June, while speeches tended to be fierce, the People's Daily had quietly begun to change, with an article published on June 6 saying 'to help the Communist Party rectify the wind in order to consolidate the party's leadership', 'Some people, under the banner of opposition to dogmatism, oppose Marxism...' The leadership of the Communist Party cannot be shaken, the socialist direction must not be blurred...'\\nOn June 8, the fight against the right officially unveiled, the People's Daily published an editorial entitled 'Why It's Why', stating that 'the right minority is challenging the leadership of the Communist Party and the working class.' 'They try to take this opportunity to overthrow the Communist Party and the working class, to overthrow the great socialist cause, pull history backward and back to bourgeois dictatorship... to put the Chinese people back under the reactionary rule of imperialism and its dog.' \\nOn June 10, the People's Daily published an editorial, 'Working Class Talking', so workers across the country frequently held rallies of thousands and tens of thousands of people to 'angry against anti-socialist right-wing elements'. The farmers also spoke: 'To abolish the leadership of the party is to dismantle the collective happy life of the peasants.' Workers and farmers 'a thousand do not promise, ten thousand should not.' The People's Daily published articles insulting the right from mid-June. In addition, the People's Daily has created a column entitled 'What words', dedicated 'right-wing speech' for critical use. Our graduation design was completed in mid-June and will be reviewed by the Departmental Defense Committee. We are all actively preparing the graduation design reply to be held in early July. The team is composed of the head of the department and the teachers of various professional classes. In mid-July, our graduation class completed the graduation design reply, and we received a notification from the school that students of the whole school graduated grade, postpone their graduation for two months, after participating in the 'anti-right' campaign, and then carry out graduation appraisal and graduation assignment. \\nAt this time, the confessions of the 'right-wing elements' have begun to be published in newspapers. The review books of people such as Fei Xiaotong, Zhu Anping, Huang Qixiang and others were crowned with 'Ambush to the people', 'surrender to the people', and 'Request the people for forgiveness' in the People's Daily. And, of course, 'rightists' who refuse to confess guilt or even fight against death will certainly not appear in the newspaper. The 'fight against the right' in our school, like the whole country, was carried out with great vigour, through more than a month's big revelation, great criticism, big struggle, a 'right-wing', 'dug out'. \\nThe main are: Professor Sun Zhusheng, deputy dean of the School of Iron Rock, head of the Department of Mechanics, each department has a number of teachers being woven among them, and more than a dozen members of the School Building Committee, whether professors or students, are spared. For the teachers who have taught our classes: Professor Guo Kezhan who taught 'Advanced Mathematics', Niu Qingjiang Fu lecturer in 'Material Mechanics', Xu Weinong assistant professor who guided the principle of electrician, and Hu Sidu lecturer on the History of the Chinese Revolution. The People's Daily reported on August 21 that after Sun Zhusheng, director of the mechanical department of Tangshan Railway Institute, and Husdu two people 'using despicable means to seize the leadership of the school', lecturer Husdu died suicide. The school leader said he was guilty of suicide. Hu Sidu is the son of a cultural celebrity Hu Shi who went to Taiwan. Only one of Hu Shi's children chose to stay in the mainland. At the beginning of liberation, he publicly declared to draw the line with the 'reactionary' father. Of the students, almost every department, grade, class has people down the net. The total is more than ten percent. In our class, a total of thirty people have set four 'right-wing elements', like the first flying swallow who will leave the nest, and they have broken their wings without flying yet. Like a nightmare, overnight, former teachers, classmates, became 'evil' class enemies. I don't know how to describe my shock and confusion about this thunder movement. Third, after the end of the anti-right movement in the final school, our grade began to carry out a graduation appraisal. Graduation appraisal is first self-summed up. It is mainly to combine their own positions, views, performance, and examination of ideological sympathy for those right-wing speech, resonance and other self-criticism. Guan, everyone is at risk, then the mass deliberation, criticism, the class committee makes comments, and finally the leadership gives a review opinion. Although not as strong as the previous stage of the anti-right struggle, the atmosphere was tense and did not know when the doom would come to their head. Although I was very concerned about the anti-right situation published in the newspapers, I did not talk to people, but read the newspaper, thought could not be without ideas, and it would not be possible to 'check' not 'check' to some right-wing remarks 'have 'no clear understanding', 'ambiguous understanding' and 'no high revolutionary vigilance'. In addition, That is, 'inspection', thinks Liu Jianzhang, vice minister of the Ministry of Railways, does not care about the 'relocation' and' of our school. 'Building schools', this minister should not be good. And do not see the right to take this masterpiece, etc. Finally pass, greatly relieve a breath. Graduation assignment is followed by graduation, since after the anti-right movement, this year's allocation scheme differs from previous years. It emphasizes that there are no colleges and design institutes, no research units, and only the Engineering Bureau and the Authority, and one postgraduate place is already in place. Set. As soon as the distribution list was announced, the classmates went on their way, no parties, no farewell, no blessings, with the pain of the heart, just so sadly went. It was originally envisaged that for completing studies, entering into society, launching a new chapter in life, when a good celebration, did not think it was 'no words to look at each other', but at this time 'silent wins sound'. More than four years ago, the vision of more than half a year ago ceased to exist. But think about the upbringing of the alma mater, the teachings of the master, the strength of the same window, have been in sight. Huaixiang alma mater number after war disaster, prepare for displacement, apricot altar intermittent, still string songs, Tangshan children, throughout Hualin. As a children of Tangshan, even if the thorns travel, want to open up a new world. \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 5"}

During the demonstration, the masses shouted slogans, posted slogans and slogan against right-wing elements from the city's drum tower to Yao Lizhong (a right-wing, former Major-General of the KMT and now counselor of Yinchuan Counselor), and Bai xuancheng (right-wing, NLD member, curator of culture). On the 12th, the masses (citizens, workers, farmers, students), went to the counselor's office to question Yao Lizhong, and some masses went to put the big print on Yao's body when they went. Visitors in the city heard that deputy mayor Ma Kunshan was also right-wing. On the 13th, they also started labelling the street and hundreds of returnees went to the Civil Commission to question Ma Kunshan. On the 13th, the prefecture held a mass conference of more than 20,000 people against right-wing elements. Secretary of the Land Committee Liang Dajun spoke at the conference, mainly to expose the sinister facts of right-wing elements across the country and in the province, and educating everyone to raise vigilance. At the meeting, a statement was passed and more than a dozen people were sent to Yao Lizhong and Bai xuancheng's family to question. Yao and Bai said they pleaded guilty and confess to confess. At the same time, Helan and Zhongning farmers called Yinchuan to speak out of the right, and told the local party committee to dissuade it."}

What does it look like for a country to be led by one party? ... the Congress is like a machine, old hair, a button, and a touch of hands,' and said: 'I heard that there was an anti-party bloc in the Soviet Union, and now any party dictatorship will have opposition.' \\nBai Bai yongguisulian said: 'Hungarian events in the Soviet Union should not send troops, it should be a rash (referring to the dismantling of the socialist system), only good.' \\nBai Bai yongguisulian said: 'Longjiang Su did not have a pandemonium, waste money is not counted, wives separated, the harmonious family has been broken up, and several counter-revolutionary elements have been brought up? Politically wronged good people...'\\nBai Bai yongguisulian said: 'What communism, fifty years cannot be achieved, that is, the last one million years, until all human destruction will not be achieved.' 'The future of mankind is not progress but degradation, not light but dark.' 'Rural life is extremely bitter. The secretaries of the rural party branch are out of production, this is exploitation. A magistrate earns more than 60 yuan, which is also exploitation. The peasants are not aware, if I, have trouble them.' 'If the world is so boring, I think the American atoms could blow it up and put an end to this human life, and thus shouting out the 'false world' of 'light and upright. '' \\nBai Bai yongguisulian said: 'The climax of socialist transformation is the order of the Communist Party. Who dares to disobey? This is the result of communist coercion.' \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"}

At this meeting, several professors highlighted three issues in their statements: first, running higher education institutions, must make good use of the power of old teachers, should make full use of their rich teaching experience, which has not been paid sufficient attention in this regard in the past; secondly, the administrative and party committees of the universities and universities are responsible People must understand teaching work, and now have to work as part of the teaching job according to their own head (e.g. Marxinism and the history of China's revolution), gradually turn itself from a layman into an insider; third, it is proposed that party organizations at all levels of the CPC should quickly strengthen their education for new party members. Now many of the new party members have low political awareness and business standards. Individuals are even of very poor quality, seriously affecting the Party's participation in the masses Prestige. \\nThe following is a summary of the statements made at this meeting:\\nSeven Opinions\\nProfessor Bai yulan of Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering said that according to his experience of the three main principles are common among the party organizations at all levels, but the degree is different, some really serious. For example, bureaucracy and sectarianism on party and government leadership at Northeast Polytechnic College are very serious, giving him the feeling of being out of the masses and lack of democracy. In his speech, he made seven comments on Northeast Institute of Engineering, Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering and Higher Education Department. \\nFirst, in 1953, the vice president of the Eastern Labour Party member stood on the top of four floors a day and made a report to the people sitting around the downstairs. The masses were not satisfied with such a meeting, saying, 'Dean's voice comes in heaven!' Form does not matter, mostly content. He was talking about the institutional reform of the college. He announced that all professors would be replaced by party members and cadres. Some of these party members and cadres do not understand business, and some have only a junior high school level. Two years later did not work and reinstated some professorships and deputy directors. At the same time, the deputy director of the party member and the secretary total power. Professor Bai yulan believes that the Institute of Civil Engineering also has a sectarianism in terms of personnel arrangements. \\nSecond, in all treatment of party members special. Prof Bai yulan Bai said, Elephant international students, allocating graduates, teachers and staff salary increases, etc., party members have priority. He said that even some party organizations also sheltered party members who had made serious mistakes, such as Sun Wei, Minister of the Party Committee of the Northeast Institute of Technology, messed up relations between men and women while at Shenyang Institute of Finance and Economics, and still messed up with the East Industry. The Party Committee did not sanction such party members and wanted to transfer him to Xi'an; later on pressure from the masses and women's federations Next, the party expelled Sun Wei's party membership. \\nThird, Professor Bai Bai yulan said that the leaders of the Donggong industry listen exclusively to the reports of a few cronies, do not go deeper into the lower levels, and investigate and analyze. There has been a great deviation between cadre promotion and salary levels, affecting emotion and solidarity. \\nFourth, in the 'three counter-' and 'anti-counter' movements, the East Industry failed to properly implement the Party's policy, let go of let some members of the Al-Shabaab group mess up, and a lot of bias occurred. He suggested that the leadership should examine the counterproductive work of the East Industry. \\nFifth, he thinks that East Industry has unhealthy conditions in the development party organization and is not tight on the education of new party members. As a result, some of the irregularities, who are known to be frighteous and speculative, have entered the Party, climbed to heaven and fall high, look down on others, compete for the status of treatment, think party members are special and have a very bad impact among the masses. He suggested a specific approach to educating new party members. He suggested that preparatory party members of non-laborers should take part in one year of manual labor-in factories, mines and agriculture, as one of the necessary conditions for the transformation. \\nSixth, on the issue of colleges governing colleges, he disagrees with so-called professors like Peking University and Tsinghua in the past, because it is a sectarian, exclusive small group. Nor did he agree that the party committee had everything in school because it could not understand everything. He thinks that the leadership of the Party Committee in policy and ideological matters is necessary. Without the party leadership, socialist education will not be possible. However, in the administrative and teaching staff who implement the policy, he believes that there should be merit and the ability to ensure that they have the right to office. All party members, democrats and non-party members should be treated equally, and no one should be special. He felt that the leadership system of the School of Architecture is not clear, leadership strength is not strong, cadres have not been fully appropriate; at present, all ideas for teaching services have not been established. It seems like a bunch of machine parts, not installed, plus horsepower, will not run; to really install it, may find some other parts are not suitable or redundant. \\nSeventh, he believes that the Ministry of Higher Education has serious subjectivity and bureaucracy. He said, according to the law of development, a region should first have mines, factories, transport, and corresponding cultural education, artificial accelerated development, and can only obey so that it can not contravene the objective rules. Suddenly moving to Xi'an to so many colleges of higher learning, it is risking to move to Xi'an. Should it be safe for both to come? He believes that this is not a disturbing issue for some people, but rather a need and a possible problem. He believes that the failure of the Ministry of Higher Education to initiate democratic discussions in advance and to take full account has led to the distress and passivity of today.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached] Expanded Meeting of the Tibetan Working Committee of the Communist Party of China: Resolution on Expulsion of Party Membership of Opposition Bai yunfeng (1958.9.2)\\nBaiyun Feng, 43 years old, Shaanxi Hancheng people, family origin wealthy farmers, my constituent students, joined the party in 1932. Committee member, former deputy secretary of the organization department of Tibet Works Commission, secretary of the Party Committee, secretary of Tibetan working committee, head of the financial department of the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region. He is currently deputy director of the Qinghai-Tibet Road Transportation Administration, second secretary of the Party Committee and vice-president of Tibet public school and secretary of the Party Committee. \\nBai yunfeng is the 'second handsome' and 'military division' of the Fan Ming anti-party group. Its main anti-party criminal facts are as follows:\\nFirst, from the 1952 Fan Ming's policy of opposing the peaceful reunification of Tibet by the Central Committee and advocating the 'partition first and then reunification' approach, Baiyun Feng's political views, lines, and Fanming's opposition political views and lines have been completely consistent over the past six years. He made Fan Ming as a 'mountainous' that he has achieved various positions, and has consistently adopted a resistance to the important instructions of the Central Committee and the Central Committee. He opposes anti-imperialism and patriotism as the criteria for dividing the political attitude of the upper ranks of the left, middle and right. He, like Fan Ming, also advocates patriotism, unity and progress as criteria for dividing political attitudes, and he said: 'Unity, mainly refers to unity with the Han people; progress, mainly in favor of reform., otherwise there will be no progress. These two articles are true patriotism'. He slandered the party's united war policy and attacked and verbally abused our work in Tibet for several years. \\nIn 1952, he actively provided advice, helped Fan Ming write the anti-party anti-central 'Several strategic issues in the current work of the United Front in Tibet', and suggested that Fan should not submit it to the Commission in his personal name, under the name of the United Front Ministry. In 1956, when Fan Ming engaged in 'big development', he proposed that 'it must be changed from past supply finance to construction finance', 'oppose conservative thinking, and the budget must be spent', 'The preparation of the past is subject to financial constraints, and future preparation is not subject to financial constraints', 'The preparation of the past is not subject to financial constraints.' Now for work needs (referred to as 'big development')'. On cadre sources, it is proposed that cadres working in Tibetan can introduce their children (including their old relatives and friends), to participate in the work of Tibetan Party; on developing Tibetan Party members, proposed that the preparatory party members can be introduced, and proposed the 'fast-track law' for the development of party members and 'short time for training outside the party, long time for training within the Party', etc. Methods (ie, sloppy absorption and re-cultivation-Note); develop youthism in the work of the Mission, to cultivate and develop and Before the Central Committee approved the establishment of a group in Tibetan youth, he and Fan Ming and Liang Feng conspired to develop 'friends' and said, 'Don't let the development team.' 'I develop teammates'; in 'big development', as long as the Commission proposed, what to give. In order to ensure that the Mission's system can spend money casually, under the pretext of the need for the work, the Commission and the Treasury jointly issued a one-line provision on the expenditure of the Mission's system that undermines the financial system. \\nIn 1956, after learning the spirit of the Central Committee's 9.4 instructions in Beijing, he still proposed to the responsible comrades of Sichuan who participated in the Eighth Congress: 'recruit some students' in Sichuan, and told the admissions teams sent to Fujian and Guangdong to send the recruits to Xi'an without any request. In April-May 1957, when 'the Commission was busy with shrinkage', he privately approved the work plan of 1957, which was essentially opposed to the contraction and continued 'big development'. After implementing the central government's 'six years without changing, properly shrinking' policy, he was extremely dissatisfied with the policy decided by the central government. When he was commissioned to convey the spirit of the meeting at the meeting of directors of the rear office, he criticized Comrade Wu for his statement on the situation in Tibet in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee, conveying exemplary Distorted and fabricated information on Tibet. (The Commission has decided that the situation Fan spoke about is not allowed to be issued), and said to his cronies: 'Secretary Fan spoke of a lot of political developments at this meeting, which was very painful. In the past, they were unaware of these situations and were blinded by the Commission!' \\n2. White not only spread and inculcate his and Fan Ming's anti-party views among their cronies, but also wilfully slandered the central government, saying 'China's first five-year plan is a leading national defense industry'; 'The double round of double ploughs does not apply to China, creating a lot, causing a lot of waste'; 'The pace of development of our country's industrial and agricultural industry Degree can not catch up with the pace of population development', etc. Bai yunfeng propaganda everywhere Fan Ming 'capable, daring to do, can write articles, sensitive, do more work than other secretaries.' At the same time, among the cadres, mainly among his cronies, he disguised other secretaries of the Commission. The attack slandered the central leadership comrades and the leaders of the Soviet Union. \\n3. From the beginning of 1952 to June 1957, Bai yunfeng was deputy secretary of the organization department of the work committee, always sheltering bad people, sheltering the counter-revolution, and fighting good people. The cadres coming into Tibet with independence come from 104 units, and the composition is extremely complex. Among them, KMT's military and political personnel, ranging from line-chiefs to division chiefs, members of the Sam-Qing League, members of the Kuomintang Party members to provincial party secretaries (such as Xue Wenbo, secretary of the KMT Qinghai Province Party Department), account for a large percentage (now the HKMA still has KMT level army. More than 30 officials, together with the anti-revolutionary, historically bad elements with political problems and lawlessness, a total of more than 300 people. (30 per cent of the total cadres of the Bureau), Bai yunfeng told the meeting alone. He believes that bad guys and political history is unclear, 98 people (excluding the 38 who he personally introduced to the AAA). The situation of these people over the past eight years was not only not reflected to other secretaries, but also assigned them to important leadership positions (some on the basis of clear instructions). \\nHe excluded workers and farmers, saying that they were 'low culture and weak capacity.' He excluded the army's re-employment cadres, saying that they 'do not understand local work.' He likes 'obedient' little intellectuals, like political history, bad quality style, but will blow, shoot, hold people. Therefore, when Bai presided over the work of the organization department of the Commission, it was a long time for non-party members and people with unclear political history to manage cadres. Bai yunfeng admitted that he and Fan Ming sheltered the bad guys and reuse old officers over 100 people. \\nBai yunfeng has a set of anti-party theory on the use of old people, and he said: 'Old people's history is complex is a social cause.' These people are good people, 'do not ask politics in the old society, not politics now'; 'Good people can do bad things, bad guys can do good.' He argued that 'there is no doubt that people don't have to be suspicious.' Therefore, he thinks that the organizational departments and the defense departments are opposing. 'When dealing with the political history of cadres like the Ministry of Social Affairs, the cadre's day is collapsed!' (Meaning of ruined-Note), In 1957, a large number of cadres were intrigued, and after he and Fan Ming premeditated, in order to preserve their cronies, named more than 30 cadres who entered Tibet from the Northwest into Tibet from the Northwest. (mainly old people), were privately introduced to the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Administration Bureau in order to preserve their cronies. Work. At that time, the cadres of the AAA were not only extremely impure in their composition, but also had a huge shortfall, but under the instructions of Fan Ming, he transferred all the cadres after the abolition of the Kangzang Highway Administration to Sichuan, and not one! In order to fill the shortfall, in Lanzhou and Xian, he introduced 38 people (24 cadres), to work in the AAA in their personal name from Tibet's inward cadres, retired personnel, among former Tibetans, and his relatives and friends. Most of them were political, historical and former military officers. This is the sheltered side, and the blow side. Only according to his own account, except for the secretary of the work committee, except for the secretary of the work committee, only those cadres that he hit and above the deputy secretary of the Commission and above, are happy to Hong, tooth Han Zhang, Wang Hua, Du Shuan (the above 4 people have internal adjustment), Wang Qimei, Huiyi Ran, Song Zanliang, Zhang Pingfan, Liu Zhaogong and other 10 comrades. \\n4. Bai yunfeng uses the authority and form of the organization department of the Commission to place their cronies and cultivate sectarian power in many departments of the Party. In order to pull up cadres and promote cronies, without discussion at meetings, use the method of approval to each business office for promotion and promotion. In fact, Baiyun Feng is the organization department, the organization department is Baiyun Feng. Baiyun Feng's 'responsive', or even 'do not want to', is not only to establish personal prestige, but a stone and double carving-both falling the reputation of a 'good man' and curbing cadres. He privately appointed Liu Jiangxia, deputy director of the Xian Office of the Commission, as acting secretary of the party group, but for a long time excluded another deputy director Li Deming from the party group. He said to comrades Bai Mingzhang, Li Tianmin and Summer Time Qing who worked in Shigatse's division of labor, said: 'You have an opinion, and let you become members of the division of labor committee.' Not only did he discriminate against the WoC, but also, in the name of the Organization Department, recommended that it remove Comrade Tan Guan-san and Secretary of the Women's Committee and replace it with Liang Feng. Before he left the organization department of the Commission to work for the AAA, in order to contest the status of Liang Feng, he wrote to the Central Committee of the Mission: 'The Tibetan Commission of the Mission should be Liang Feng as secretary.' \\nFan Ming's anti-party sectarian activities mainly rely on the organization and planning of Baiyun Feng. He planned for Fan Ming and pulled together Chen Jingbo, committee member of the work committee and minister of the United Front Work, Xia Zhongyuan, committee member and finance committee secretary Xia Zhongyuan. He said: 'The departments led by Chen and Xia are very important'. 'The problems that Fan Mingmention, it is difficult to pass without their support.' Under Bai yunfeng personally engaged in 'struggle and unity', Bai, Chen and Xia formed Fan Ming's 'three checkpoints' (organization, united war, finance), and 'first-class cadres' to oppose the work committee. \\nFive, Bai yunfeng is a hypocrites of 'surface appearance, suddenly despicable'. He was generous at the meeting in 1954 when he resolved the issue of unity of the Tibetan Party. He said, 'There is simply no problem of ununity in the southwest and northwest. We are Party cadres, not Fan Ming's cadres.' But privately said to the model: those statements at the meeting 'were forced to say this.' In 1957, he was very reluctant to go to Qinghai-Tibet Road Transport Administration as deputy director and deputy secretary of the Party Committee. But he believes that the party should also 'play the wrist and see who played', 'the more they squeeze us, the more we should be generous.' After premeditated with Fan Ming, he advised Mu Sheng Zhongda to send a telegram to welcome Hou Jie to the AAA. Mu Sheng Zhong is very trustworthy, and obedient, but white to Mu is a superficial compliment, use, behind the blow. The number of rumors that he had spread to slander the Comrade in charge of the Commission and the Central Committee is a lot, but because he has always been 'prudent' and 'doing things in his heart', he has cheated the impression of an honest and diligent 'good man' among the people, even many comrades who have been hit by him, have no doubt. He was in 'revenge'. \\nAfter the beginning of winds in Tibet, Bai (working in Tibet public school), 'in order to express his willingness to progress', reported to the Commission: 'Ask the Commission to transmit to me the opinions of the organs directly under the wind to me in the whole wind.' On the other hand, he wrote to Fan Ming, saying that Sun Zuobin and Sun Dian had only been designated as the right, reminding Fan Ming of 'vigilance Just after the issue of Fan Ming's 'Journey to the New West' in this meeting was revealed in the big print newspaper, he immediately went to draft from Fan Ming and read it overnight, saying to Comrade Chen Jingbo: 'The journey to the New West is a very political thing, if it is written, it is a struggle between two routes.' He said at the group meeting: 'It was written about the struggle of two routes'. After uncovering the characters of the New West Travels, he said to Liang Xuanxian (committee member, secretary of Shigatse division), and Chen Jingbo: 'This is a bad picture!' To Liang said: 'Fan Ming is really going to break down this time!' 'Why do you fall like this life!' And plan for Fan Ming, calling him 'to calm', 'good deal with customs clearance'. After Fan Ming's outline of 'New West Traveling' was revealed, Bai yunfeng violated the provisions of the Commission not to hold meetings privately and illegally convened meetings, undermining the disclosure of the evil of the anti-party. In the dental chapter and the fan-check the material, white stands out, rampant against the dental chapter, to cover the obvious. He covers Huang Lin destroys the diary. In order to destroy her records that she had with Fan Ming, Bai yunfeng and other people, called Bai to bring her diary to Lanzhou. When her organization asked her to hand over her diary, she replaced it with a book without writing, secretly burned the diary. It was clear that the size of the two books was very different. Bai yunfeng said that Huang Linto he managed to bring back to Lanzhou is this book. Bai yunfeng's morality is also extremely bad, and relations with some lesbian lesbians are extremely abnormal. \\nBai yunfeng has been dissatisfied with the Party's use of him for many years. Before entering Tibet, he was deeply dissatisfied with not being the organization minister and commissioner of the Dali Land Committee. After entering Tibet in 1952, he was not elected as a representative of the Eighth Congress, member and deputy secretary of the Tibetan Supervisory Commission, and did not work after shrinking in 1957. The organization minister or secretary-general of the Commission has long been dissatisfied with the leadership of the Commission. In his history, it was a series of hiding and deceiving the party; from what White made about his history at the cadre meeting, he had long concealed from the party in 1935 when he wrote an article to curse the Red Army and said when talking to the Communist propaganda team and agents. 'It is not suitable for China' and other rebel behavior. Bai had lost relations with the Party twice, and had provided two comrades Gao Dehui and Xue Hefang to the anti-Communist propaganda team. In 1935, 1936 for a long time with the agent Gao Yuting, Zhang Zizheng, and Zhang Zizheng went to the pseudo-Central Military Academy teaching team. He consistently expressed dissatisfaction with the conclusions made by the Northwest Bureau. When he attended the Eighth Congress meeting in 1956, he took his own files to Beijing without the work committee and handed over to the Central Organization Department in the name of Comrade Guohua, and asked the Central Group Department to reproduce conclusions about his history. He also colluded with his cousin Liu Jiangxia (deputy director of the Xi'an Office of the Engineering Commission), and sheltered each other, asking Liu to prepare his historical materials properly. Bai went to Beijing and sent a telegram to Liu Jiangxia to testify on his historical issues. This is obviously a ghost fetus and intentionally deceive the organization. After being revealed at this cadre meeting, the evidence is indeed that he still pretends to be deaf and sold silly, always refusing to make honest statements. \\nBai yunfeng in several representations to the above mistakes, attitude is extremely unhonest, always avoid weight is light, encountered a key problem 'can't remember', trying to cunning. \\nThe above facts show that Bai yunfeng is a faithful implementer of the political line of the opposition, is an active planner and organizer of the anti-party faction. It is a far-right element who has always deceived the party, resentment with the party and perpetuated anti-party activities. For this reason, it was decided to dismiss him from his membership and to remove all his administrative posts.

After the performance, Premier Zhou Enlai invited three artists to dinner at the guesthouse. During the meeting, Zhou Premier raised the blackjack emotionally: 'Today I have to see the theater three Jie cooperative performance success, this life is lucky!' Bai yunsheng was appointed by the Ministry of Culture as deputy director of the theater, the opera artist who was drifting in the old society for most of his life said with gratitude: 'I came out of Baiyangdian countryside to sing the play, is the party gave me and Kunqu infinite life, must make more contributions to Kunqu in the future...'\\nBai yunsheng (1902-1972), formerly known as Laisheng, Anxin Baiyangdian village Ma village, 7 years old private study, graduated from Baoding IV high school, worked in Tianjin business. Ma Village is a famous play, especially popular Kun Yi Caen, and many outstanding actors have emerged. Bai yunsheng since childhood by Xiqu, love Kunqu, amateur joined the village Kunyi 'children's society' to learn the play, in 1920, he forcefully joined the kunqu theater class 'Rongqing', as a career, he decided to work hard. Master from Baiyun Tei, learning by performing, often performing in Beijing, Tianjin and Bao areas. In 1922, he transferred to the famous actor Wang Yiyou and Bai Yutian formed the 'Xiangqing Society'. Due to his good talent condition, he was favored by the classmaster Wang Yiyou, received his deeds, officially learned the Kunqu Danhorn performance, because of his cultural foundation is better, and quickly learned the dan-horn play 'Si Fan', 'Thorn Tiger', 'Tibetan Boat', 'Jade Garden', 'Piano Pick · Ask Sick', 'Flower Giving Sword', 'Fat Tongue, 'Spring Innocence', etc. Frequently with the play class in the Jizhong countryside running wild table, catch the temple, sometimes performing 3 or 4 games a day, hard art hone, so that he quickly emerged, he starred in the repertoire was very popular with the audience. \\nIn 1928, he led the Dan angle and the famous Wusheng Hao Zhenji formed a 'Qingsheng society', which has long performed in Beijing, Tianjin, Bao regions, and also traveled to Shandong, Shanghai, because of his delicate performance, singing colorful, everywhere, quite praise, in 1930 in the Tianjin performance newspaper commented: 'White sang Do old, like Wang Yao Qing, singing wide and narrow high pitch, words into the flute Eye, eye-catching, said white crisp, is in the Quundan wheel veteran.' His performance was well known. \\nKunqu entered the 30s of the last century, gradually into decline, just as Baiyun sang performing arts such as the day, Han Shichang's performance is missing small actors. In order to pong Han Shichang performance, in Han Shichang master Hou Ruichun came forward to talk, Bai yunsheng reshaped Wen Wu Xiaosheng, since then white, Han Jieh as a good partner, once a small life, formed a 'Xiangqing Society'. Due to the strong lineup, the 'Shogeisha' honorable theater. Bai yunsheng in order to master the little life acting skills, he paid to Peking Opera, Cheng followed first as the division, the teacher gave his family 'Heroes Association', 'Eight Great Hammer', 'Odd Double Club', 'Beat the Tomb' and so on, Bai yunsheng's performance skills have increased greatly, becoming a rare small talent.

Due to the close cooperation of White and Korean, the 'Xiangqing Society' reputation is growing, so that the decreasing Kunqu presents a flourishing situation. \\nIn order to expand the influence of Kunqu, Bai yunsheng and Han Shichang made a breakthrough move. They led the 'Xiangqing Society' in the summer of 1936 to fall 1938. They spent more than two years touring six provinces, starting from Tianjin to south, performing in Jinan, Kaifeng, Hankou, Changsha, Nanjing, Shanghai Jia, Xing, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, Yantai and other places, can be said to be hard.

In order to adapt to the audience's appreciation needs, the Kun Zigzag and twisting drama, pulling up the gain-end, compiled into major dramas such as 'series', 'roar', 'hairpin', 'thousand gold' and so on. These reforms have improved the attendance of Kunqu. Baiyun survives boldly try 'Kun Huang two pots' performance, that is, Pi Huang and Kunqu perform at the same time, or a play while singing kunqu while singing skin yellow, this has a certain effect on slowing the decline of Kunqu. Bai yunsheng's performances include Tang Minghuang in the Changsheng Temple, Pan Bizheng in the Hosta, Liu Mengmei in the Peony Pavilion, Zhang Junrui in the Xixiang, Xu Xian in the White Snake, and Zhao Chong in the Horse Trader, all the characters he shaped are lifelike. \\nAccording to the article 'Kunqu class excellent results in Baoding' in the early 40s of the last century, said: 'Han Bai Kunqu Society went to Bao sing, originally scheduled to return to Beijing on 20 days, the play code for the front and rear 'three laughter marriage' and the new row of 'gold'.

It was indeed an accident, two consecutive performances, Korean fear tired, daytime dropped, by Bai yunsheng and Mrs. Li Fengyun performed Dazhou, while Han starred in the night session, Bai yunsheng is a day and night. 'The most red of this trip, Han Bai Wai, when pushing Li Fengyun.' Li Fengyun for Bai yunsheng Lady, Dingxing County people, is the first Kundan in the history of Beikun. It can be seen from the above records that 'Xiangqing Society' performed in Baoding and one of Baiyun's performing career. \\nEntering the 40s of the last century, due to years of war, the nation's peace day, the north kunqu sharp decline, the banja has dissolved, entertainers star scattered, Bai yunsheng breadwinner, actually put up a tea seat in Beijing Zhongshan Park, at this time he still misses his beloved Kunqu, he tries to print some plays, while selling tea while selling tea, while singing to explain, visitors are recruited to share, Hyperlink 'http://photo.blog.sina.com.cn/showpic.html\\\\\\ l 'blogid=5eac1f3e0100n6rq&url= http://static8.photo.sina.com.cn/orignal/440075aet9577f7b4f767 \\\\\\ t\\ _blank' theater colleagues and ticket friends also come here from time to time to sing...\\nFinally, he was expecting the establishment of the People's Republic of China.

I have seen some taste. \\n4), Do not pay attention to the democratic parties and do not work well in the united war. I share the views of Comrades from the Democratic Party. I would like to talk about one more personal encounter: I am a member of the Jiusan Society. I was in the hospital for almost a year. The United Front Commission did not talk to me once. On one occasion, the Party Committee convened a forum among members of the Democratic Party, and was known to be the director of the teaching department that there were five people on the notice list and three were the masses (including the director of the teaching department), making people inexplicable and ironic. Later, I said not to meet again, it ended up without such a disease. I really don't understand how the Party Committee understands 'long-term coexistence and mutual supervision'? \\nFive), to the teacher in order improper, disrespect. I listened to the grievances of several old professors, compassion, and distress. In the newspaper, I saw that the academic title of an old professor in our hospital was not resolved for a long time, but also wrote a former professor at the time of his departure. I am an associate professor after liberation. After coming to the hospital, I said to see how to teach and solve the grade problem for up to three months and half a year. My teaching effect is not bad, students have reflected, and the leadership has also been personally affirmative, but until now it is still a 'teacher'. No wonder friends said: 'School of Political Science and Law is high, you have lowered two levels.' \\nI think this time, my hospital work should be improved. Good or bad wind, it is very relevant to improving the work. In order to help the party make good winds, I put forward the following two suggestions. \\n1), Break the concerns of the commentators. I think the comrades who left the hospital and returned to the hospital this time have no concerns, said thoroughly and made sharp opinions. This is good for the whole wind. Most of the comrades who are still working in this hospital have concerns, fear of reprisals later, and do not dare to speak freely. The Party Committee must still show that 'the speakers' innocence, the word will not be guilty.' \\n2), Take practical action to set off the whole wind climax. This is the policy of policy. Party committee and party leaders should vigorously carry out this spirit and encourage everyone to speak with practical actions, namely, to face up and recognize shortcomings or errors in past work, which can be corrected at that time, and that those that cannot be immediately corrected should also be corrected by the deadline for accountability or guarantee that no longer have the same defects or errors.

Because of the Communist Party's disregard and repressive policy of old officials, although he was an intifada, he usually lived very carefully and cautiously and never dare to say a word. \\nWhen the anti-right struggle was under way, they had not started to whistle there, and no one had put it, that is, no one was 'attacking the Communist Party', and there was no 'rampant attack by the bourgeois right.' However, according to the practice of previous movements, they were given the target of hitting the right in the museum. As previously said, there are quantitative indicators for every movement, as is the fight against the right. \\nIn the absence of vigorous enlarging conditions, the leaders held a symposium and asked people to help the party to put forward their opinions. Because the anti-right has begun and who dares to make an opinion, no one has spoken. \\nTheir leaders began to mobilize one by one, saying, 'Helping the party to rectify, is a big question, is a test of whether you are with the party. If you stubbornly do not speak, you refuse to help the party to rectify, that is to stand on the opposite side of the party, so you have to speak. 'Uncle Three still did not speak under such mobilization. \\nIn the case of a right, the leadership of this unit was under tremendous pressure, and they had to force people to speak, and things turned into something like this: 'If you don't speak again, you prove that you and the party are two hearts, you are the right. 'The three uncles are listed as the focus of mobilization, and are in fact targeted within the right. On the day before being forced to speak, Uncle Three gave his wife farewell and made a statement with a mentality of death. \\nAs soon as you speak, you turn to the party attack. The absurdity of such acts has been rejected, and in order to accomplish the task, only those who are innocent and those who are absolutely unwilling to speak. \\nThe three uncle was quickly beaten into the right and sent to re-education through labour. A few years later, he died in a penitentiary. \\nREFLECTION: Later people will not believe in such a thing at all, but this is the real event. This phenomenon is another form of bitterness, and it is not difficult to imagine how poor and unfortunate the person concerned is. \\nMao Zedong's repression of the 'enemy' is no less than Stalin's non-torture torture. The same blood and tears, the same cruelty, the same human hell!"}

We all hold a pure, passionate heart of the red, to pursue the truth, to learn achievements, to contribute to the country to society! Under such motivation, hard reading, thinking and exploring, choosing your own path of life. In the wave of the student movement, and the rich and attractive activities of various associations and departments in Tsinghua Park, we were inspired to join the revolution, join the Communist Party, and to strive for a democratic, free and prosperous new China for life! Many alumni remember the oath of joining the party. Comrade Wei Renzhi, my incomrade, who died for my life, talked with me about absorbing me into the party! \\nThe second stage, the first two or three years of liberation, to the ideological transformation and anti-right movements one after another, years to ten years, the ideological and emotional journey in these seventy-eight years:\\nThe liberation of Beijing, the establishment of a new China, the continuous movement of Kay song, endless loud singing, victory, excitement, joy, excitement, excitement, excitement, feeling everything is fresh, exhilarating, and everything needs to learn, follow, adapt, and then obey the arrangements, go to different fronts, so that it lasted two to three years. \\nLater, gradually felt that their inner heart and new life and atmosphere were a little bit less closely matched, and felt that the new reality was not as beautiful as the 'mountain, ah good place', 'democratic and free flowers flowing, happy, happy come' when the underground struggle was singing, so imagined a sunlight. What is this going on? Of course, it's absolutely right to follow the party. Well, this feeling is a weird idea of their own small bourgeois, they really need to be reformed! ashamed! secretly in the heart of self-reproach, self-criticism, and sometimes bravely in group meetings to examine, expose ideas, and even cry, but the depths of thought did not really solve the problem, small assets smell (where it is generally not improved to assets), and from time to time, hit it back, hit and risked;\\nThen he went through movements such as mentality transformation, approval of Hu Feng, and rebellion to the anti-right, actively followed, but did not understand very well. Why is self-examination accompanied by confusion and even fear in the heart? Why can't you keep up with the party? It's your own position is not the right point! Hearts sad, and do not dare to say, want to hurry up and can not. \\nAfterwards, is a more incomprehensible movement, the absurdity of the great leap forward, down the extreme incomprehension and panic of Peng Lao General, and then until the Cultural Revolution defeats everything, destroying everything...\\nFrom about the mid fifties to 1976 crushed the 'Gang of Four', this nearly 30 years of the course of the process, is to keep up and not keep up, endless criticizing others and checking themselves, internal confusion, pain... This drives themselves, step by step into thinking, reflection, personal retrospective reflection, the party, a review of the state... some questions have been answered , some questions are stuffed in our hearts, in short, we have embarked on a journey of thinking, reflection, exploration, and gradually approaching the truth. \\nThe third stage, great sadness from 1976 to the early 1980s:\\nAfter the ecstasy that defeated the 'Gang of Four', a feeling that seems to be the second liberation, followed by a big discussion of the standards of truth, the liberation of ideas, the chaos and reversed anyway, piled up like a mountain of grievances, justice is done, really ice open frost thaw, spring back to Shenzhou! Light has arrived, sincerely rejoice, excitement, ecstasy! Then, the economic reform has begun to bear fruit, and people's lives have improved at first... It seems to have left the panic and feel comfortable, with new hopes for the country and the individual! \\nThe fourth phase, the thirty years since the reform and opening up:\\nThree decades of great, brilliant, national rise, people's lives improved, the political environment in general has gradually been relaxed and progressive... Our understanding and mood are positive and happy;\\nThen, Hu Yaobang stepped down, passed away unexpectedly, the wave of wind and nine waves of anti-liberalization, as well as many subsequent measures, created new confusion. New problems and contradictions in the lives of the nation, society and people, together with the complex changes in the situation at home and abroad, were worrisome, confusing and re-energizing. Provoked thinking, some thought deeper, understanding a higher level, comparison Mindful bright, some improve a little, but dismayed, puzzled, still more than clear, in such a thought situation and, we continue to care about state affairs, care about reality, discontent, dissatisfaction with many dark things, thinking about how to eliminate these ills and darkness...\\nThat is to say, after thirty years of great change and change, we have also gradually become older, have experienced victory and setbacks in reform and opening-up, and saw brilliant achievements and more contradictions and problems, our generation of Tsinghua has been observing, reviewing, thinking and rethinking. The year has entered deeper thinking and new expectations! \\nIsn't these four stages of experience and thought course not our common spiritual asset? \\nèr\\nAfter such a long process, what is the same and what is different from our youth, to the years of joining the party and the revolution? \\nI think the same, unchanged, or sublimation to new heights? There are at least two points:\\n(1), the aspiration of the nation to be the people, worried about the feelings of the nation, the spirit of the pursuit of truth, still does not diminish that year, perhaps not so exposed and exaggerated in performance, but deeper, implicit and solid;\\n(2), still support the correct leadership of the Party, trust it, and eagerly hope that the Party will do better. \\nDifferent, there are two things that vary:\\n(1), Have a deep sense of rational thinking and pragmatic spirit: fully affirm the great bright face and all the good things that our party does, soberly see and criticize its shortcomings, no longer as naïve and childish believers, but gradually questioning, observing and thinking rationally;\\n(2), the theory, line of the party and it follows, and the major changes it has carried out, think of course must be correct, follow, sing, and no longer beautify with wishful eyes, but rather calm and objective observation and research, yes, support, wrong, bad criticism, hope it corrects. For example: although the motherland has begun to revive, rise, and the rapid economic development, it is encouraging, but in the process, the resulting gap between rich and poor is large, society is unjust, and many legitimate rights and interests of the people are not guaranteed. In particular, political reform is not possible, power and money are growing, corruption is increasingly corrupt and the people suppressed. Is it possible to achieve real socialism? Can we build the beautiful, harmonious and happy society we want? ... These major problems, which are about the rise and fall of the country, deeply plagued our generation of Tsinghua, who entered the revolution in the 40s and early 1950s, as well as the vast majority of the same generation of intellectuals and other people. We are no longer about the reality of the new China. Everything is of course, all said good, all sing praise to moral! 、No longer though loyal, but do not understand the complexity of the world, will not use the brains of naive children. We need to support the party, care for the party and help the party with rational thinking and advice! \\nSan\\nAs a Tsinghua man over eight years, I would also like to say a few words about the feelings and thoughts of my alma mater and the word 'Tsinghua people':\\nSpeaking of Alma Mater, a kind of kindness, pride and deep remembrance in my heart, accompanied by many unforgettable past events and memories, and I know that many old classmates are like this. This can be called a 'Tsinghua Complex'! It is natural, should be, it is good a kind of sentiment. \\nBut now I have the idea that we should not overly solidify and preach it too much, let alone indulge in it. \\nBecause, on the one hand, it encompasses respect, love and affection for his alma mater, which should of course continue; on the other hand, it encompasses certain self-pride consciousness, which is not good. Tsinghua's glorious history and contribution to China has been said a lot, and there is no need to say much here. But it can not be said that it has been perfect, flawless, but also to be better, not just stay in the glory of the past, but to keep up with the times, continue to improve, to the next level. For example, the development of his alma mater after liberation is not perfect. It is not good to take the lead in the movements of faculties reform, ideological transformation, anti-right, and other movements, to create villains in the Cultural Revolution. Also, in recent years alma mater has many new trees and developments, we listened to certainly happy, but feeling flashy and greedy and lack of modesty wind, seems to have infused us a little! \\nFor example, it is necessary to put together professional colleges such as medicine, arts and crafts that were originally well done by the people themselves, and they all put on the brand of Tsinghua? Is it really good for every aspect? Also, are there elements of formalism, dogmatism and ideological indoctrination for students in terms of education and guidance, including ways and means of educational guidance, and whether the students trained are qualified or higher in moral character? There are indeed a lot of excellent top talents coming out, but the materials heard also come out some of the city's criminals who only know for the fame for profit and some people who hold money on the right right! \\nI also encountered a small thing: yesterday I received an invitation to go to the Great Hall tomorrow to attend the centenary celebration. On the back, I saw two lines of glittering words, 'No guns...' 'Forbidden...' I immediately remembered a history of the founding ceremony. The previous day or two days before the ceremony, the command leadership conveyed to us the instructions of Comrade Peng Zhen: the invitation card to the Tiananmen Square and the observatory stand immediately reprinted, the printed 'ban...' will be changed to 'do not...' Peng Zhen said, 'Comrade said, 'Comrade said, 'Comrade said, how must you waste manpower on a small letter on an invitation card? Financial resources. No, it must be changed. You must know that this is a great ceremony for opening the country! We just entered the city and built the country, we spoke with orders on invitations issued to many foreign party friends, forbade this prohibition, how will people react in their hearts, so you have just been headed by the Communist Party, without a little humble attitude, what will happen in the future!' I thought this little example was worth thinking about. \\nThese shortcomings and shortcomings, if present, are they in line with Tsinghua's 'Houde', 'Humanistic Day New', 'Realistic Innovation', the idea of independence, the spirit of freedom and modest and simple Tsinghua's excellent tradition? I heard a lot of old school masters having questions and comments. From an alma mater's perspective, I'm afraid there's something to think about. Recently, a classmate called Jiang Fangzhou wrote a letter to his alma mater, causing some sensation. The leadership of our school responded. I think the answer was good, gracious, see the level, and can be said to be in line with the excellent traditional spirit of Tsinghua. \\nPersonally, 'Our generation of Tsinghua' is a very thought-provoking and inspirational term that encompasses the love, nostalgia and development of our hearts and minds for those of us who grew up in her liberation years and became part of her glorious history. I think President Wang Hu proposed to write 'Our generation of Tsinghua people', the main purpose is here. This is a very good proposition and topic, and it's a deeper connotation. But I don't think we should always stay in the years of remembering and praising. That era has passed. In addition to our deep memories and remembrance of the good things, we also realized that there was naive and blindness at that time, and now is more mature. We should review the past more scientifically and rationally, and inject more connotations into the 'Tsinghua people of our generation'. The foothold and vision of the non profit and loss should be improved, expand some; that is, keep thinking summary, keep pace with the times, to reach a new The high connotation. This is in line with the demands of today's great new era. \\nSih\\nWhat should we, this generation of Tsinghua people, do it under such ideological, emotional and objective situations? \\nI believe that under the premise that the Party must reform and move forward, we still love and support our Communist Party of China. We are unworthy of our participation in this party when we were young people. We are still grateful to this party, who has led us on the path of sacrificing our nation to the people. We deplore and deplore the serious mistakes made by the party for decades and the loss to the nation and the people, but still have full confidence, confidence and strong in the party The hope! What do you want? Hopefully it will correctly summarize, reflect on everything, and embark on the right path of self-reform and self-improvement in the new era, so as to better lead the country forward on the road of increasingly bright! \\nOur party has a deep masses base, crushing the 'gangs of the four', reforming and opening up, improving the lives and conditions of the majority of the people to a considerable extent. This reinforces this foundation; this party has strong strength and rich experience, including leadership, domination and governance of the country and The experience of society in China today does not allow other political forces to qualify to be capable Instead of it; while it itself is capable of self-reform and self-renewal, driven by the great cooperation of people advocating reform from both inside and outside the National Party, it is able to lead the political system reform that China needs, thereby gradually building true democracy, rule of law, freedom, equality, harmony and greater prosperity. There are Chinese characteristics. In short, positive, negative and multifaceted, this is probably the only viable and secure way forward for China to pursue its political system at present. \\nThat is to say, our generation of Tsinghua, of course, also wants all the Tsinghua people to position themselves as loyal patriotic and patriotic party reformists, not the opposition, and not the other stoves outside the system. Our generation of Tsinghua, all the people of Tsinghua, and other people with consensus, should do their best to support and help the Party build better, so as to lead the country towards greater light! \\nAs mentioned above, bold words, may be more improper, please correct the school! Thank you! \\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attachment 2]Guo Daohui: 'An era of scanning and national record ·'\\nProfessor Bai zucheng's giant book 'Road Man Man', from 'fire' to 'tears' and 'thinking', a total of three volumes, more than 4 million words, which lasted about 15 years, cast into these trilogy giant, wrote his life from the children mentioned by him. Between the floats and ups, sorrow clutches, mourning, can weep. Read their books as they see them, as they may be. He and I were contemporaries and almost peers (he was one year older than me). Our experience was largely similar: before liberation we participated in the underground party revolution at Tsinghua University (he belongs to the Northern Bureau system, I belong to the Southern Bureau system). At the beginning of liberation, he worked in the Beijing Municipal Committee, and I worked at the Tsinghua Party Committee, and had 'the fiery heart of young people' and sent an infinite and wonderful vision for the new society. But the new China is not as clear as we thought, but there are sometimes black clouds. In a few years, we have been beaten as 'right-wing', and we have personally tasted the bitter consequences of the post-liberation political movements. But we do not sink, but continue to 'search' along the way to the truth. As we often sing in the student movement: 'What is falling, we have hard bones, climb up and move forward!' Xinfeng reform and opening up, we are lucky to 'correct', to be able to stand out from the ranks of 'cattle ghost and snake god', start a new life struggle journey. \\nOld white happy to fill a word: 'Golden sword buried early, broken ground heavy sheath, ask the edge is not damaged, straight to the group of demons!' The people and things described in his book reflect some of the common encounters and destiny of Chinese intellectuals of the contemporaries, from which we do not find it difficult to experience many people who resonate. Reading it is admirable, or saddening, or revealing. As an author's peers, alumni, comrades and 'hard friends', unlike the general reader, I have 'no general taste in mind'! It is also important that we have not only crossed the old and new societies, two centuries of old and new, but also two periods before and after the reform, which is the most spectacular and most tortuous years in China's recent and modern history. \\nThe author named the book 'Road Man Man', not just describe its 'repair far', but in its 'bend', 'road trouble'. The author has served as the central and upper cadres of the Beijing Municipal Commission for Discipline Discipline and the head of the municipal tourism company and the Tourism Institute and other units, and also participated in the examination of 'four gang' criminals. As an insurer of personal experience, he has been able to look closely at the various manifestations of various political movements and daily work of all kinds of people in the North and the wild, so this book is not just a personal biography, but scans an era and intellectuals of this era. The bitter history of contemporary Chinese intellectuals who are known as a cottage, and about the ruling party since the 'founding of the country' History. And its authenticity and rational thinking are beyond the 'normal history' written by the DPRK. In this book, Zucheng speaks about the purpose of writing the book is 'to give a drop of water to the long river of the historical literature of the motherland', sinzai said! The sun is visible from a drop of water. And his drop of water is 'clear water' and can see an era and its creatures. Lu Xun said that the history of Barnyard's official history is often more real than the official history books, 'because the painting is too thick, too much nonsense, so it is not easy to detect the bottom of the background... But looking at wild history and miscellaneous notes, it is easy to understand, because they don't have to put too much on the shelf of history officials.' \\nOver the years, such unofficial cottage biographical literature has sprung up, and a lot of piercing works have been popular with readers. Such as Wei Junyi's 'Thinking Pain Book', Barkin's Capricorn Record, Ji Xianlin's Bullpen Memories, Zhang Yihe's 'Past Things Not Like Smoke', Jurist Jiang Ping's Floating and Dead Rong: Eighty Readme, and so on, are popular. A common feature of them is to reveal the truth, Zang no figures, have slight words and rational reflection. I think Bai zucheng this giant book also belongs to this category. As Liu Shaoqi said, 'Well, history is written by the people.' This sentence not only shows that the people are the creators of history, they 'write' a dreadful history every day with their own actions; but also in the information society where the Internet prevails, ordinary people can also send news on microblogging every day, the polls, expose scandals, and fight corruption. They are 'citizen journalists' and 'Kusano historians'. The ancient feudal dynasty in our country set up a 'living note' official position that specifically records the emperor's words and deeds. Its task is that there are no great details about the emperor, good deeds are recorded in order for later people to repair history, and when the Emperor must not ask, in order to restrain the monarch's words and deeds. Emperors have been afraid of their scandal acts being recorded. Tang Taizhong once wanted to check, but was rejected by the living Lang Chu Suiliang, saying: 'Living today, the history of ancient history, the scrivener's words, and remember good and evil, thought that it was not illegal for the Lord to be seized. I don't hear the emperor view of history.' \\nToday's Internet, microblogging can also be said to be the 'living note' of contemporary party and government officials, but not just the only 'living lang' in the courtine, but on a larger scale, is placed under the popular surveillance and Internet records of the people, proclaiming the world, forcing leaders to 'Weibo ask politics'. In ancient China, from emperor to doctor, most valued the 'behind name' and awe history books. Liu Shaoqi said that the truth of the 'Great Famine' is 'three natural disasters, seven man-made disasters,' and told Mao Zedong: 'So many people are starving to death. History should be written on you and mine, and people eat together, and to book.' At last decided to bring down the 'Khrushchev' who slept around. \\nBig people so, small people around how to taste otherwise. Several folk 'history books' listed above in this article, including this book, also involve some small party and political cadres and intellectual celebrities. Their good deeds or inferior traces have also been recorded one by one by one, and have escaped official screening, filtering and shielding. Perhaps this is one characteristic of this kind of private biography that is better than history. Lu Xun most appreciated the 'History of Rulin Foreign History', noting that its starting point is 'to uphold the fairness and reckoning the times and cons'. He believes that China's historical sarcastic novel is 'fair and ironic'. I think some of the biographies listed in this article, including Zucheng, can also be said to be contemporary 'new biography of Ju Lin'. However, these biographies are not fictional novels with artistic truths, but rather reportage with historical truths. The truth they reveal, based on the different experiences and perspectives of each person, is 'multifaceted' and thus enriched. They left black footprints to those who 'use whip as their sole performance' in the various movements within and outside the party; to those above the people who sit above the world, 'one person said to count', to introspection; to those who were fooled into 'tame tools', cause due warning; also by recording certain honest and well-intentioned people in the thousands It is difficult to maintain the heart of the red and distressed German government, demonstrating the 'light of the dark kingdom'. I think this kind of biography that looks at the world from one person, records the size and size of people and the world, is worthy of popularity, to be highly appreciated. It also needs to pay attention and discussion in history, so that such folk history books can be perfected, spread over the long term, play a greater social impact..."}

In the second half of the twentieth century, the world experienced the climax of a thriving communist movement (represented by the victory of the Chinese Communist Party), and the collapse of the communist camp. The end of this half-century is the rise of China with uncertain future. \\nThe history of China in the second half of the twentieth century is of great significance not only to China, but also to the world. The purpose of this book is to describe some aspects of the fifty years through the moments that I feel personally. The story is, of course, a half-claw of the times, not a reflection of history; but its value is that it is faithfully documenting a number of historical moments. \\nThese moments, are a moment of shock to the mind of the author, or positive, or negative, have the power of excitement, furious or deep regret, grief. Life like the author, personal happiness, anger, sorrow, joy are always closely related to the state of society, so that the personal feel shock moment, most have a certain historical basis. That's why this book is written. \\n1/The Song of the River\\nNovember 1947, Kunming Normal University playground. \\nAt 9:00 a.m., although it's winter, the weather is glamorous. Some of the students in the first year of high school in Kunming Teachers College came to the Teachers College to participate in the meeting for the protection of human rights of some students in Kunming. I squeezed to the front with a few of the best classmates and happily close to the faculty sitting on the steps, some big brothers and sisters, disregarding the dust on the ground, sat down on a butt. \\n'Which school are you guys from?' A female college student asked. \\n'School attached high school, first grade.' Zhang big rush to answer. I starred straight at this big sister and attracted by her beauty. \\n'Do you know why activities to safeguard human rights are carried out?' She asked me. \\n'I...' I'm in a hurry. \\n'Did you participate in the study aid campaign?' \\n'Participated, we raised a lot of money.' I answered. \\n'You see, the study aid movement is meant to help students with difficult lives. What's wrong with this? However, the Police Command actually caught our classmates, classmates did not even have minimum human rights, should they object?' \\n'Of course it should! Firmly against!' I said enthusiastically. \\n'Good kind!' She praised that a pair of show eyes wandering on my face and I was excited. \\n'Welcome Little Ni Sing!' Some of the students at the school beside suddenly shouted. \\nWarm applause. \\nBut the big sister who was talking to me stood up peacefully, cleansed his throat, a burst of hearty songs sounded:\\nThe Cossacks of the Don River drinking horses on the river,\\nThere was a teenager standing next to the door,\\nBecause he thinks,\\nHow to kill his wife?\\nSo he...\\nI was focusing on listening to this beautiful big sister singing Soviet folk songs, and suddenly I heard someone yelling: 'Come on!' \\n'To be democratic! Be free!' \\n'Down a one-party dictator!' \\n'Immediately release arrested students!' \\n...\\nReflections:\\nI was involved in the student movement when I was 16 years old. At that time, the civil war was fighting very fierce. Kunming had shocked the country's 'one or two' movement, and Mao Zedong personally praised Kunming students. In fact, the student movement in the KMT rule is the second battlefield directly under the Communist Party's leadership. The student movement has seriously damaged the reputation of the KMT and greatly weakened its social base in the city. \\nDuring the war against Japan, the Chinese Communist Party has developed rapidly, and the Communist Party has established millions of troops and bases. After the war, the Kuomintang has neither been (nor too late), to make economic gains, nor politically appealing claims. Patriotic intellectuals, especially young students, were drawn to a large extent by the Communist Party slogan to join the opposition to the KMT rule. \\nBecause Yunnan Province is located on a frontier, local government is largely under the control of local forces. Opposition against the KMT central government is not as brutally suppressed as the mainland provinces, so the student movement has flourished and is known as the 'democratic fortress' in Jiang Guan District. At the age of 16, I was involved in the revolution under the slogan of democratic freedom and against autocracy. \\n2/Secret joint in the small teahouse\\nDecember 1948. Kunming a small tea upstairs. \\n'I officially inform you that the municipal committee has approved you to join the party, according to the party charter you are still about 18 years old, but you have been a member of the MC branch secretary for a period of time (MC is the code of 'People's Youth', 'People's Youth' is the short name of the underground secret organization 'New Democratic Youth Alliance'), which can be used as a special Situations are treated. Your superiors want to talk to you. Tomorrow evening at 8 o'clock, you take an algebra book on your left hand, an English book in your right hand, go to the second floor of the small tea house called 'Yipinxiang 'on the east side of the Volkswagen Cinema. Someone will find you, codename Wang Ying.' Yang Fujong informed me very seriously. He is the out-of-school contact for MC. \\nI went on schedule and found that there were only two or three people on the second floor of the small tea house, very cold. I picked a corner to sit down and my heart was very nervous. After a while, suddenly behind a gentle voice: 'I am Wang Ying!' A man of 30 years old sat across me. He wore an old Lamb sweater, which is not too thin, but this is winter! \\n'Don't be nervous, relax! If anything unexpected, you call me uncle, and we talk about American movies.' He said he sat down next to me intimate, laughed at me kindly and pressed down his voice, and continued, 'Your application for joining the party I read and wrote it well. You said you read a lot of Marxinist books this year, and you said to me, what did you read, what did you experience?' \\n'I had a lot of books at home, and my father had almost everything. I found Zou Taofen's 'Translation of Reading Even', Plekhanov's 'Development of Monist History,' Marx's Value, Price and Profit, the Communist Declaration, and the Economic Outline of the River Zhao, and...'\\n'What?' He interrupted me. 'On the river Zhao? Is it Japanese?' \\n'Yes, the Japanese masters of Marxism, are described in the book. His analysis of economic foundations and superstructures was particularly exciting. He said the superstructure can be divided into first and second buildings, and the second superstructure refers mainly to ideology. I think Marx's historical materialism is very correct, and many of the complexities of human history have been interpreted by historical materialism and made simple at once.' \\nHe asked me about my understanding of concepts such as residual value and labor into commodities, and I was fluent in answering. He seemed very happy. \\n'How do you say you want to draw the line with your family?' He smiled and asked me. \\n'Although my father was a university professor, a social celebrity in Yunnan and supported the student movement, but after all, he was an official person, many ideologies with a bourgeoisie taste. So I had to draw the line with this family, to stand on the proletarian standpoint to criticize all bourgeoisie stuff.' \\n'Of course, what you say makes sense. However, you should understand that your father is a famous progressive intellectuals in Yunnan, the father of the guardian uprising in Yunnan. He has a high reputation in society. He supports many progressive activities led by our Party. You must pay attention to respect him, support him and encourage him. Never hurt him emotionally. In addition, pay attention to learn more from him, your father is a man of Bogutong today.' \\nAt the end of the conversation, he quietly handed me a paper bag, telling me that it was Mao Zedong's 'New Democracy Theory' and Liu Shaoqi's 'On the Party'. \\nReflections:\\nMore than 50 years have passed, and the scenes of this conversation are still alive. From what I learned later, it seems that I also impressed the leader of the underground municipal committee. In a working meeting soon after, Yang Furong conveyed the instructions of his superiors, which seemed to mention me. He said that the municipal committee instructed to strengthen the learning and education of the Marxinist theory of student party members. There is a high school student party member. Self-study theory is very useful, and has read many Marxinist books, more than the general college student party members know. He laughed at me when he said. \\nWang Ying's real name is Gao Zhiyuan, one of the three members of the Kunming underground municipal committee. I knew his name and identity after liberation. In 1950, as one of the heads of the Yunnan Provincial Supervision Commission, he asked me to go to work with him and was rejected by me because I wanted to stay in the city to work. Soon, he was appointed secretary of the Xishuangbanna State Committee, and Chu Xiong as secretary of the local committee. The anti-right center, like me, is classified as the right, tormented. After correcting the right in 1979, he had been seriously ill and flooded in his breath, and came to Kunming to stay in Kunhua Hospital. I went to visit him, he held my hand tightly and tears. 'I know you will come, you will come, I want to see you!' He was powerless but emotionally said that I only felt a strong mourning in my heart and pulled his hand to sigh at the unknown. Soon, this leader, which I deeply respected, died as a result of the long torture and severe illness of the right-wing identity. He was one of the outstanding figures sacrificed by thousands of communists who had been beaten up to the right in the party, and his death left me unforgettable. \\nAlas, that winter night, in a small teahouse in Kunming, wearing a thin Ramblan, his mercy image lived forever in my heart. \\nMy direct leader Yang Furong, was also persecuted shortly after liberation for unwarranted charges and his wife Zito Huai. Szto Huai is the leader of the underground women's movement in Kunming. She is a relative of the famous Chinese Szto Mei Tang, playing the piano. She sold her beloved piano in order to raise the cost of the Yunnan Underground Provincial Committee to report on her work in Hong Kong and Shanghai. She was detained for many years because she was suspected of being an agent. Although Yang Furong did not draw the right, he also suffered several torture and died nine lives. \\n3/Million Army Entry\\nDecember 1948, Kunming Zhengyi Road Street. \\nKunming in winter is not very cold, this evening, I just finished meeting with the sunset and will go home, walk to the righteous road, suddenly heard the newspaper vendors run along the street, running around and called: 'Big news, big news, Lin Biao army entry!' Passers-by scramble to buy \\nI quickly bought a evening newspaper, opened a look, and a headline featured in large print: 'Lin Biao rate millions of troops into the nest.' I was stunned at once, so excited in my heart, thinking, the revolution was triumphant! \\nIn my heart, the battle in the Middle East North East began in September. Fought 500,000 enemies in just three months, and now millions of male divisions enter the border, and the Kuomintang's gas count is almost complete. I was thrilled to shake my hands and stood in the street with a newspaper and read repeatedly, and could not be calm for a long time. \\nReflections:\\nAlthough I am not in the army, I am also deeply aware of what is called soldiers defeated. Three years ago, Chiang Kai-shek also sang a few months ago to 'wipe out the communist bandits'. Once upon a time, current affairs were quickly reversed. The Communist Party led the PLA was attacking with the prospect of descending the sea. \\nLater it was learned that after the victory of the anti-Japanese war, just when Mao Zedong went to Chongqing for negotiations, Liu Shaoqi presided over the CPC Central Committee meeting, decided to gather a large number of senior cadres, including a large number of Central Committee members and elite troops into the Northeast. Lin Biao, as a talented politician and military scientist, has fully used his talents and launched a large-scale campaign of Liao after three years of raising elite, altering the situation of civil war across the country and shifting the PLA into a strategic offensive. \\n'Lin Biao's Life' book says:\\nFrom November 23, Northeast field army main departure: right walk cold exit, middle road Xifeng mouth, left road to Shanhaiguan. \\nIn the General Command of the Northeast Field Army, Lin Biao said with a smile to Liu Yalou: 'I do not enter the border or invincible, and become a traitor Cao Cao.' \\n'Why?' Liu Yalou did not understand the meaning of Lin Biao, asked. \\n'Wei Shu Wu Chibi battle, Cao Cao Dajun south, with how many soldiers?' Lin Biao asked. \\n'Known as million, in fact, only 830,000 horses.' Liu Yalou is familiar with the 'Three Kingdoms'. He did not think, blurred out. \\n'How many troops do we take?' Lin Biao said broken. \\nLiu Yalou understood. Northeast field army claims million, the actual strength is also 830,000. This coincidence, Lin Biao has not ignored. \\n830,000 claimed to be the entry of millions of troops at the checkpoint. This news came that the hearts of the people throughout the country floated and were strongly shocked. After a few months, Chiang Kai-shek lost gamblers, the more lost and wanted to move the book, all the old books were thrown out, at once lost. In early 1949, the quasi-sea campaign broke out. The main power of the KMT was set in large numbers. Immediately after the Fu Zuoyi uprising in the Pingjin campaign, the main military forces of the KMT were eliminated, and the overall situation of the country was determined. \\nWhether the failure of the Kuomintang and the victory of the Communist Party are the lucky or misery of the Chinese people, this is up to historians to study. But to be sure, this civil war is to be seen from the perspective of the emergence and development of communist movements throughout the world. From a historical perspective, it seems that everything in the Communist Party is new and creative, and that the working people around the world in the country have turned over, and that all mankind has to move towards the path of happiness, is so deeply popular, so strong that no force can stop it. Compared to historical trends, any Kuomintang mistake has only minor significance. The Communist revolution is a great experiment that humanity always undergoes, and it always takes place regardless of success or failure. The lessons of the French Revolution's blood are not enough to sober humanity, and things must go to the extreme before they turn back. Without this experiment, humanity will not die of the dream of heaven on earth. \\nUnlike India, China is a country with a strong revolutionary tradition. Historically, revolutions and intifada have surged. Coupled with the invasion of foreign enemies, as in Russia, foreign war paved the way for breaking down the old order and establishing a revolutionary regime. For a great and beautiful dream, how many people have paid blood and life. The cost of these bloodshed and loss of life will be assessed by history itself. \\n4/Tomorrow Uprising\\n8 December 1949, home. \\nAt 4 p.m., Chen Shengnian suddenly arrived at home. The secretary of the underground party and municipal committee did not lead me directly, and his arrival surprised me. \\nHe said to me on a Putonghua phone with Guangdong Township tone: 'Tell you a big news, tomorrow Luhan is preparing for the uprising. Now, the Liberation Army is far from Guizhou, and there are two armies of the 8th and 26th Army of the Kuomintang around Kunming, and the immediate uprising is very detrimental to us. But Luhan did not accept the views of the underground party and insisted on taking advantage of Zhang Qun's opportunity to do so. You immediately inform the party members of your district and the head of the 'people you' that you will be ready for an urgent task tomorrow... In addition, you can tell your father that underground party border leaders may want to meet with him. Ask him to think about how to maintain normal order in Kunming after the uprising.' \\nSince Luhan recently killed 21 people in Kunming due to the looting of the Central Bank and being included on the list of war criminals on the radio of Xinhua News Agency, the underground party has always taught us not to have fantasies about this person. I immediately rushed my bike to schools in the northwest district of Kunming in charge, and found the Party and the 'People's Youth' branch secretary, and agreed to meet tomorrow morning. A sweat returned home and asked his father to tell him that Luhan was preparing for the uprising. \\nMore than 10 o'clock in the evening, my direct superiors and deputy secretary of the municipal committee, Lai Weimin came to my home again and laid out my post-uprising job. He said that to educate the party and allied members to correctly treat the intifada authorities, to overcome left-leaning ideas, and to play slogans that support the Luhan uprising. The most important task now is to mobilize the masses, defend the cases and state property of each unit, closely monitor the movements of all reactionaries and step up collecting lists of hostile elements and reporting to the municipal committee. \\nOn December 9, Yunnan declared an uprising. Luhan formed the Yunnan Military and Political Commission, an organ of the interim regime. Among its members are the names of Yu Chengwan and Li Mi, two commanders of the 8th and 26th Army of the Kuomintang Army. We quickly learned that Luhan took the opportunity of Kuomintang general Zhang Qun Laikun to invite the main officers of the Central Organ in Kun to a banquet in Wuhuashan, capturing Yu, Li and the head of the secret service and so on. It is said that none of the people resisted. Only Li Mi was the most stubborn. At the time of his arrest, he actually recite Wentianxiang's 'positive song' loudly. Luhan felt Zhang Qun's personal grace to him, and released Zhang privately without asking the Central Committee. \\nAt that time, I was the secretary of the District Committee of the Northwest District of Kunming (since the underground work in Kunming is the strongest student movement force, the division of the area is largely based on student sports. (I was actually the secretary of the Northwest District of the school transport, but the underground party organization documents published after liberation officially listed me as secretary of the Northwest District of Kunming.), , immediately, day and night organized party members to act up, to carry out the task given by their superiors. \\nReflections:\\nLuhan was busy with the uprising with his full reason. At that time, the Kuomintang authorities wanted to move their command center from Chongqing to Kunming. Many of the top KMT members, including Jiang Jingguo, had come to see. If they were not determined properly, it would have serious consequences. There are two local armies in Luhan's hands: 74 Army of Yu Jianxun and 93 Army of Long Zehui. Although the combat capacity cannot be compared to the 8th Army of the KMT Central Army and the 26 Army, it can always resist for a period of time, not to mention that the PLA can rush to Kunming in a few days. The KMT troops are morale low, and take the opportunity of Zhang Qun to detain the chiefs of the two armies, they can force the two armies to not make a difference. Of course, Luhan also prepared another hand, which is to quickly move his command center to Dali if necessary. \\nLater, at the request and pressure of the 8th Army and the 26th Army, Luhan returned the deducted C commanders Yu Cheng-Wan and Li Mi, and some of the two armies immediately began an attack on Kunming, so the defense battle broke out in Kunming. Luhan's troops, with the support of the Kunming people, kept Kunming, led by Chen Geng and Song Ren-poor, and rushed forward, forcing the 8th Army to flee south with the 26-army cang emperor. \\nAfter the Lu uprising, immediately called Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Mao and Zhu to call back to welcome, while criticizing Lu for not reviewing his mistakes (Lu killed 21 people in Kunming two months ago due to the central bank robbery). Lai Weimin told me about this, and gave me a message from Mao and Zhu Yuan. When I was 18 years old, I had a sudden heart fever, actually launched students all over the street to publish this message. Lai Wei came to me quickly and badly. For the first time since we met, he said, 'What do you turn over Luhan?' Scared me to ride my bike all over the city and ordered the school MC organizations to immediately tear off the published big print. \\nThe objective of Lujan's establishment of the Military and Political Council was clearly to preserve part of the local strength. He knows how powerful the Communist Party is. On the one hand, the Communist Party Central Committee agreed and retained the Yunnan Military and Political Commission that he had set up and set up the Yunnan Provincial Military Region and the People's Government of Yunnan Province, making the so-called military committee a flower shelf. \\n5/First see underground party secretary\\nIn December 1949, one night after the uprising. A small conference room. \\nOne day after the uprising, I was informed to attend a meeting at the night, about the KMT provincial party department, which I can't remember. This is the first time I attended a semi-public meeting of the underground party, with about 560 participants, all of the top leaders of the Kunming Underground Party. \\nI went a little late because the meeting room was small and had to sit at the door and saw a man in a suit talking. He spoke of Yunnan from the whole country, from the underground struggle over the years to the uprising. I think he was really high and admired. I felt this was the most wonderful speech I heard for the first time. One of the small things that makes me unforgettable. 'With the uprising, the situation has changed and the way people work will change,' he said. For example, what should I do to let stores in all streets of Kunming have a five-star red flag? According to our old approach, is to launch party members and allies door to door to door. This kind of thing will not have to be so much effort now. Just ask the Kunming Public Security Bureau to issue an order to ask the police to notify it!' He talked about this, the whole crowd was outraged, and there were various discussions. \\nReflections:\\nLater I knew that this person was Zheng Boke, head of the Yunnan underground party of the Communist Party of China. Zheng Boke sent to Yunnan as secretary of the provincial committee via Zhou Enlai in 1941. In 1949, the Party Committee was established in Dianguiqian border, he is deputy secretary, and Yunnan is still in charge of his work. \\nJust a few days after this meeting, Zheng Burke went to my house to meet his father Bai Komatsu. My father was a prestigious social celebrity in Yunnan. He was a participant in the guardianship uprising in Yunnan and was hailed as the Patron Father. Served as Secretary General of the Dutuo Palace while Tang Jiyao. After the resignation, has been teaching in Yunnan University, poetry articles for a moment alone, the name rose up, reputation three. He sympathized with and supported the students' patriotic democracy movement, and Jung Burke once said he was 'great!' Zheng Lai met his father, mainly advising his father. If the KMT troops invaded Kunming or under various conditions a vacuum in Kunming, ask his father to come forward to maintain social order and protect the people's normal life. To this end, he suggested that his father should come forward to organize a political council, unite the Yunnan community and help the Communist Party to control the situation. \\nAfter liberation, he was still respected in the first place. Song Ren-poor, secretary of the CPC Provincial Committee, was moderate and better for him. But later it was different. In the wave of anti-localism, he was endured enough. If he did not leave Yunnan early, he was afraid his life would be difficult to secure. \\nZheng Boke's congress was part of the whole underground party in Yunnan. After liberation, Liu Youguang, who was transferred from the military and political committee to the local secretary of the Diannan Working Committee, wrote a report to the Southwest Bureau and the Central Central Committee to describe the Yunnan Underground Party as a group of orugas, 'serious organizational impurity'. By 1954 Xie Fuzhi became the secretary of the provincial committee, he carried out a comprehensive criticism of Zheng. In early 1950, the 8th Army and the 26th Army of the Kuomintang entered Kunming. In order to strengthen the momentum and calm the hearts of the people, Zheng Boke decided that Zhu Jiabi, deputy commander of the border column, led the guerrilla forces into Kunming and held a small-scale entry ceremony. Prior to that, Yunnan guerrillas occupied places and established new regimes. This is a very natural thing to us. When criticizing Zheng Boke, it turned out to describe the guerrillas into the city as Zheng's 'preemptive entry into the city' (before the regular PLA), and the Yunnan Underground Party setting up government institutions in various places as 'grabbing the territory from the central government.' I was shocked by listening to these criticisms, and I felt that they were all very absurd accusations, all of which were unwarranted charges. However, the Central Committee approved these unjustified accusations, which made me implicitly feel for the first time that the Party Central Committee was not very fair either. \\nMost of the underground party leaders who remained in Yunnan were tortured in anti-right and anti-localist struggles, and many were killed. Chen Shengnian, secretary of the Municipal Committee, is considered to be in a better position, but also repeatedly demoted. My direct leader, deputy secretary of the municipal committee, Lai Weimin, was criticized as a traitor in the Cultural Revolution, tortured and died with impunity. Of course, this is something later. The leaders of the underground party are intellectuals, and teachers have more origins. They treat people in general very sincerity, there are few official shelves, and I live with them, like my father and brother, care for each other, mutual respect, sympathy, which looks like the whole person later. \\nSo far, the friends of the underground party, think of the misfortunes of many of them, still remain unforgettable. In China, the fate of the underground party is miserable. They struggle under very difficult circumstances, sacrificing their lives for their own ideals, in the struggle against the right, and in the struggle against the right, especially in the Cultural Revolution, many of them were brutally tortured to death, many of whom died nine lives and survived. The reason for this is mainly because the underground party is led by Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai. Most of them are intellectuals, not Mao Zedong, so they have been rectified repeatedly. The novel 'Red Rock' celebrates the heroic battle of the underground party. However, it is this group of people who struggle for their ideals (ideal is another matter), and a sense of justice, after liberation turned into a slaughter in Mao Zedong's hands. \\nThe Communist Party under the leadership of Stalin and Mao Zedong, always on a large scale, especially its own party comrades, is uncommon in human history. \\n6/Photos of the old bubble\\nIn January 1950, Denhua Street, Kunming. \\nThe news of the sacrifice of Xi Shujun suddenly made me grief. \\nShe was my classmate. She was the leader of my people's youth in the attached school. Later she went to pragmatic high school as branch secretary, and I led her again. We all call her old bubble or bubble big sister. She was killed by Li Run's subordinates. \\nLi Runzhi was an emperor who ran through Mount Ailao from the 1920s to the 40s. He occupies more than 21,000 acres of good fields, and there are two thousand soldiers, more than 200 employees, and more than 300 mule horses, and blatantly dominate one side. In a battle, the old bubble was captured, the enemy inserted into her breasts with a needle, and with twine tied her nipples to force her to surrender, her answer was: 'Revolutionator, head broken, blood can flow, never surrender!' Li Chongan beast under the part of the sickness of Li Run, but called a knife to scratch her meat...\\nI was full of tears, thinking of the past together, infinite sorrow. I figured out a picture she gave me, cut a red penta and let the photo set in the stars...\\nReflections:\\nOur young people, 18 and 9 years old, have always been looking forward to a better future for communism. When we were together, many times talked about the great communist ideals and were willing to contribute everything and even life to that ideal. To this end, I have also made a certain example. I gave my first love lover, a 16-year-old girl to the guerrilla area... The old bubble sacrificed, I thought it was worth it at that time. The martyrs exchanged blood for a brand new China. But is it really the incarnation of truth with the blood of millions of martyrs who stained red flags? Does the martyrs really have no bloodstream? \\nIn my two years as secretary of the underground party branch and district committee secretary, I have promoted the future of communism to many young students. I have spoken a lot of words that describe a better future, and I have spoken time and time and again about that paradise: a new society of equality, fraternity, democracy, freedom and prosperity. Can be liberated after the real life, but to crush their beautiful vision. Every thought of the beautiful dreams I said to those hot blood teenagers, those who had their own mustrous night talk, often cry and laugh. \\n7/Father and son as a member of the military\\nDecember 1949, Lujan House. \\nOn the afternoon of the end of December, I and several comrades from the Kunming Municipal Committee of the underground party went to the former Yunn"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "an Province Chairman Luhanjia to discuss how to welcome the PLA's entry into the city. At that time, I was vice president of the Kunming Federation of People's Associations (I took this position in my capacity as a representative of university and high school students in Kunming). During the meeting I was mentioned that I was the son of Bai Komatsu, Lu appeared surprised, asked me how old I was, after knowing that I was under 19 years old, he greatly lamented and asked me to go back to my father after praising me. \\nWhen agreeing on the list of members of the Preparatory Committee of Yunnan Province to welcome the PLA into Yunnan Province, the Kunming Federation of People's Groups reached an agreement with Luhan to be chaired by Luhan, and seven members of the People's Federation and the intifada authorities each were invited to participate, including the father. \\nIn this way, my father and I became a member of the Yunnan Committee to welcome the PLA into the city. When the mother saw the large envelopes of the two Yunnan Military and Political Commission sent to her home, all said the words 'Bai Committee', mistakenly believed that the writing had been repeated. When she knew it was husband and son, they were smiling at all. At that time, the whole family was full of joy and confidence in the future, and no one would have thought that such a family close to the Communist Party would have been killed seven years later. \\nReflections:\\nHis father had been deeply disgusted by Chinese politics, and he did not believe that China could move smoothly towards democratic freedom. He understands the chronic ills of Chinese society and knows that it is not something that can be eliminated at once. But under the influence of the warm atmosphere of the country at that time, in particular the influence of my brother and my brother's two communist sons, I had to follow the pandemic and forge a friendship with the Communist Party and was prepared to fully support the Communist Party's revolution. Our family, two sons are the Communist Party, the father is the most important (in Yunnan), democracy recognized by the Communist Party, the mother is the principal of the primary school who is enthusiastically supporting the Communist Party, and two sisters, one in the PLA, and one in the revolutionary work in Kunming. Such a red family, how enviable at that time. My father and I were members of the army, which is a microcosm of the face of this family. Once upon a time, such a red family was ruthlessly destroyed by the Communist Party. \\n8/Chan Chan Meets Father\\nFebruary 1950, at home. \\nI greet generals Chen Geng and Song Renqiong with great passion to visit my father. \\nThis was a clear afternoon. General Chen and Song, who just led the four regiments into Kunming, accompanied by Zheng Burke to my house. I was in the midst of their meeting with my father. \\nAfter expressing a warm welcome, his father highly appreciated the simple and frugal efforts of the Communist Party cadres. He said: 'All officers and soldiers in the city wear the same cloth clothes, very admire! It can be seen from these small things why the Communist Party is popular. People enjoy the world.' \\n'Where, officers have two more pockets!' Chen Geng said with a smile. The name will appear humble and courteous. \\n'Mr. Bailao is very famous in Yunnan Province and strongly supported the work of my Party. We listened to Comrade Burke for a detailed introduction. We are here to express our gratitude to Mr. Old. I hope that Mr. will teach more in all aspects in the future.' Song Renqiong said. \\n'The two of them first arrived in Kunming, very busy, but still squeezed their time to visit the democratic people. The first to visit was the old gentleman.' Jung Burke said. \\n'Thank you very much! 'I didn't know much about the Communist Party before, and after the help of my two sons and the leaders of the underground party, I really got to know it.' My father turned to me first and then to Jung Burke. He went on to say, 'I have a pessimistic view of China's future for a long time. Now I see all the practices of the Communist Party for the common people, it is really remarkable. I can't be moved wholeheartedly, and I feel that China has real hope. Having listened to the two speakers several times, really high level, I hope to get your guidance and help in the future.' \\n'Now is just the first step in the long march,' Song said. Chairman Mao taught us that the most important thing is to quit. In fact, my level of this person is limited, and many places are far away. Not long ago, I accompanied Comrade Peng Zhen to take troops to Shijiazhuang. Some capitalists sang a praise to us and said many overly respectful words. I don't have a taste in my heart. In the evening I said to Comrade Peng Zhen: 'I listened to so many compliments today, really felt flesh and hemp. 'Comrade Peng Zhen said, 'You flesh and linen, I simply scared out a cold sweat.' I thought, my consciousness was still worse than Comrade Peng Zhen. Chairman Mao taught us to be vigilant on the path of Li Zicheng, and specifically asked Guo Moruo to write an article on the 'Three Centennial Festival of Jiashen' and asked us to study carefully. We do something wrong, and ask old Mr. to give valuable advice.' \\nReflections:\\nSong Ren-poor's words about 'meat and linen' and 'scared out of a cold sweat' made me extremely impressed. I was proud that we in China had such a party, and I admire the humility of the central leaders. My impression is also confirmed by many trail news. I heard that Chairman Mao Zedong, corporal Li Xian, personally asked Fu Zuoyi to talk seven times after he went to Beijing, and also asked Wu Han several times. At this time, Mao Zedong and senior leaders of the Chinese Communist Party treated democrats and intellectuals something like 'Zhou Gongli.' Unfortunately, the good scenery is not very often, once, the early liberation of this mental state and style disappeared without a trace, reproach, the corps soon to the opposite. desperate, desperate and disenfranchise to reach an unprecedented and final point in Chinese history. The approval of Liang Yuming is a typical event of this turning point, which is a tragedy for China and that of Mao Zedong. \\nNine: angry\\nMarch 1951, Kunming Municipal Committee Office. \\nAt the end of February 1951, the 'Federation of People's Union' work came to an end, I went to Kunming Municipal Committee to report, temporarily did not appoint a position, divided into the organization department to help work. At that time, the staff was very streamlined, with only five people in a municipal organization department. Since I have held some leadership positions in the underground party, the minister's confidential documents are kept by me. \\nOne day I opened the central secret telegram forwarded by the provincial committee, which contained a message from Chen Yun on the national food issue. The meaning is: now the national liberation, but the autumn harvest grain has been requisitioned by the KMT government. Now there are many people in the public to eat. There are no food in the hands of the central government and can only ask for food once more. In this way, it will inevitably cause dissatisfaction among many people. Chen Yun said: Even if they are angry, they will also have to get food, otherwise, the Communist Party's regime will not be able to stand up to its feet. \\nThe four words 'wrath of heaven' surprised me. This is the first time that my student cadre knows the complexity of my work. Aren't we talking about taking the masses and serving the people every day? However, when the problem is serious, even angry and grievances must be done. Later, forty years later, there was an incident of 'six four' crackdown on students. My mind cannot recall the four words Chen Yun said. I understand that the Communist Party has the determination to do so in order to defend the regime, that is, to make God angry. \\nReflections\\nChen Yun is the head of the Communist Party in charge of economic work (which he personally said). This person is not easy to speak, and it is very important to speak. After liberation, the Communist Party's economic achievements were largely due to his leadership. Every time Mao Zedong makes a mess of the economy, it is up to him to come forward to clean up the mess and desperately reverse the situation. The Great Leap Forward in 1962 brought the national economy to the brink of collapse, and he came forward to solve. At the 7,000 people conference, Mao, Liu, Zhou, Zhu, Lin, and Deng Du, the Standing Committee of the Party Central Committee, spoke. Mao Zedong asked Chen Yun to speak, he just didn't speak, said he was not sure. However, at the West Building meeting, which was opened shortly afterwards, he spoke a lot and was well received by the participants. While he made great achievements for the Communist Party, he also deepened the idea of the planned economy in the minds of all cadres, and he himself became the general representative of the planned economy. It can be said that this person's early contributions are great, but old age has become a major impediment to the progress of history. Dealing with the market economy, he and Deng Xiaoping have a completely different attitude. He opposes the market economy, the holding of special zones, and the enlightened policies of Hu Yaobang and Zhao Jiaoyang. If he lived longer than Deng Xiaoping, the consequences would be unimaginable. \\nTen: the whole party\\nNovember 1950, Kunming Municipal Committee Party Training Course. \\nAfter more than two months of study, it was the turn of writing a summary of my thoughts. I honestly reviewed my life in 19 years, wrote my experience and advantages and disadvantages. Because my history is simple and the youngest, I was scheduled to be the first to be reviewed at a panel meeting. On this day, I thought I could pass through the border smoothly and confidently and frankly made a summary of my thoughts at the meeting. \\nIt was surprising that my statement came to an end and was strongly criticized at the panel meeting. Speeches under the guidance of party training staff were all a tone. People say I'm a typical representative of the small bourgeois, and my summary is praising myself, and there is no way to surrender to the proletarian. Said that I am a little intellectuals who have not reformed well, I have joined the party in the organization, and I have not joined the party at all. \\nI was bombed by a whole siege for more than three hours, and I was shocked and turned. \\nI was insomnia for the first time in my life. The words 'little intellectuals not transformed', 'to surrender completely to the proletariat,' these words frightened me. I always believed that the communist was the proletarian vanguard. I was already a member of the proletarian advanced, and now suddenly referred to as a representative of the small bourgeoisie and had to start from scratch and surrender to the proletarian. Where does this start? So how can I join the Communist Party? \\nI modified my summary document again and again and again, being bombarded at a time, that was not able to pass. \\nIn the face of my fear and discomfort, a party training staff member and experienced foreign and veteran cadre approached me for a conversation. He said: 'You have to understand that you have to badly deny yourself who originally considered it remarkable, not not without pain and tickle denying, and fiercely negating. I took part in the wind in Yan'an, and those big cadres who had a great credit have cried out themselves, what do you mean? A little youth, there is nothing to deny. After completely negating that good self, admitting that you have many stains yesterday, you are today's self-admit yourself as a very bad self; later, to deny this today's self, completely surrender to the proletarian, arm yourself with the proletarian ideology, deny it, you will Become a good man. Simply, you must first admit that you are simply not human, it's stinky shit! Negate the image of self-thought beautiful, admit that they are ugly, and carefully analyze the reasons why they are not human; then, go back to the party to show loyalty, swear again to be a man, again negate and decide to be party tame tool. This is the dialectic: beautiful people-not people-glorious communists armed by proletarian ideas!' \\nAt that time, I was ignorant and understood, and finally cried at the meeting that I had nothing to do. Originally, I thought that the Marxinist books that I read were more than an advantage, and now I knew that the knowledge without combining practice with workers and farmers was not as good as shit. Yourself is a little bourgeois molecule that has not been transformed at all, dirty. Be determined to surrender to the proletarian and re-become a man\\nMy thought summary was passed. This gave attendees a great shock, 'Even young people who have a simple idea of history like white are so pure, so what are the older people of us saying!' \\nAfter the party course, I seemed to feel that I was really a communist, but I had some skepticism in my heart. \\nReflections:\\nThe intellectuals in the Chinese Communist Party have undergone similar 'spiritual transformation.' The reason why many of the absurd political movements that followed had not been subjected to the resistance they deserved was related to the complete spiritual disarmament of the people. One of Mao Zedong's invention is to inject a special 'original sense of sin' into the soul of all intellectuals-you are not an industrial and farmer origin, you are born with the mark of exploitative class. Your knowledge, your opinions, and your thoughts are all stink; you must surrender to the proletarian Cut ideas and practice surrender), otherwise you will never be a good alien who has not reformed. This spirit is essentially a religious spirit that deprives a person of the free ability to think freely, allowing you to always kneel piety before the Lord of the religion. \\nSince childhood influenced by fathers and many Western European philosophies, there are more personal independent consciousness in the subconscious, I am less dominated by this sense of sin, so it is easier to get rid of it later. But this is not the case for many. For example, Ding Ling, she completely negated her past in Yan'an rectified wind and negated all her excellent works. Until she was classified as the right, she was still living in the shadow of 'original sin'. Even after her rightist status was rehabilitated, she still insisted that the book she wrote in re-education, full of the spirit of 'total surrender' was the best piece of her life. Wang Meng, former Minister of Culture and famous writer once said: 'I cry for Ding Ling!' In fact, he Ji Ding Ling, a generation of intellectuals held by the 'original sin spell', for a long term or even a lifetime, is far from an individual phenomenon. \\n11/Deadline to carry out three counter-movements\\nDecember 1951, Kunming Municipal Committee organs of the Communist Party of China. \\nMa Jikong, secretary of the Communist Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a report on the implementation of the three counter-movements at the meetings of municipal committee bodies and the city's system leadership cadres. He said: 'The Central Committee held a meeting of the regional central bureaux secretaries in Beijing. Chairman Mao ordered them to carry out the campaign within two days after returning to the region. Moving, either themselves bureaucratic or corrupt.' He also said: One thousand small tigers embezzled, 10,000 yuan big tiger. \\nI listened to the report and was greatly shocked. It is not possible to dream of embezzlement in the Communist Party. But there are also many questions in the heart. How can you determine who is the suspect of corruption in two days? How many embezzlers will be in the Communist Party? Everything is so incredible. \\nReflections\\nThis is the first time after liberation to carry out a stormy political campaign within party and government organs and state-owned enterprises. I knew at the briefing meeting that military representatives of a factory actually arrested more than 50 people on the spot at a mass whistleblower congress at one night, solely on the basis of verbal complaints from individuals. \\nAfter all, most people are not brutal, many units in the first one or two weeks only stay in learning documents, check the waste phenomenon, and do not catch the battered objects. But the central telegram snowflakes flew, even in places where the army is strictly managed, also caught a large number of tigers. \\n'Which unit can't catch the tiger, which unit's leadership must have problems!' Such words are flying all over the sky, making people dismayed. \\nI am privileged to see the report that Mao Zedong has approved every day. Later I learned that Mao Zedong's main way of leading such political movements was to turn over the experience of 'advanced units' and force people to follow suit with the behavior of some people with a fever of mind as an example. In so many provinces, cities and departments throughout the country, there are always some units caught up tiger. Mao Zedong approves such reports by telegram. He added very harsh criticism to urge all regions to follow up quickly. In my impression, the most positive one reported catching tiger was the Northeast Bureau. The Northeast Military Region caught all sorts of tigers. \\nMore than a month after the campaign began, Mao Zedong further proposed to submit the tiger plan. The following document was signed by Mao Zedong on February 4, 1952:\\nEach central bureau and turn to substations, provincial and municipal party committees and local committees, the major military regions, volunteer troops, and to all levels of military regions and the military forces:\\n(1), The Communist Party Committee of the Central South Military Region reported on February 1 that the forces of the Central South Military Region directly under the Central South Military Region are planning to hit one hundred and six 'big tiger' and 3,57 'little tiger'. We believe it is appropriate. This is an initial budget, which can be added at any time in accordance with the circumstances. Please urge the Central and South Military Region to urge all military regions and military forces to quickly draw up their own 'tiger' plan and report to the Central Committee. The plan of the Central and South Military Region is sent to all regions for reference. \\n(2), Each central bureau, branch office, provincial party committee, district party committee, municipal committee and land committee, the major military regions, the volunteer army and its various military regions and military regions at all levels and armies, so far have not yet made the 'tiger' budget, limited to making this budget within three days, reporting to the Central Committee. It is also necessary to be prepared to automatically raise the budget at any time and report to the central system. \\n(C), provincial and land committee level to do this budget, can include the size of the county and township level may play the size of 'tiger' numbers...\\n...\\n(6), Following the report of Comrade Gao Gang on January 26, the whole northeast plans to catch 500 'big tiger', yesterday (February 3), reported that it has increased to 2,000. The military commission directly under the system admitted to catching 100 'big tiger' a few days ago, yesterday added 150, a total of 250. Together with 300 other systems at the central level, a total of 550. In addition, you have been informed of the experience of North China. It can be estimated from this that every small province should have the size of several hundred tigers, and each medium province and large province should have the size of 'tiger' of 12,000 to 3,000. According to the calculation of the North China Bureau, there should be more than 10 percent of the 'big tiger'. These include the staff of the Party, Civil and Military Sciences, but not private business and private schools. Experience at the Northeast, North China and the central level can be used as a reference for your budget. \\nMao Zedong\\n4 February\\nThis is a very important, very typical document, and a careful reading of this document will make it easy to understand how political movements are being carried out. Without any scientific basis, all regions and departments draw up tiger targets and implement tiger levels. You must play tiger as planned. This does not force the death of many talented people to blame, it does not produce many grievances! \\nUnder extreme pressure, the Kunming Taxation Bureau made a 'breakthrough', playing a number of tigers. The municipal committee immediately organized the leadership cadres of various units to visit and study. I went too. I saw a number of temporary cells with tiger cells, each with a tiger...\\nIn a cell, a man was sitting with a beard on his face and long hair. I know this is a comrade from the underground party. All the debris in the house has been removed, empty as well. Only a narrow floor paved in the middle of the house, he sat on it, every five minutes to say: 'Report, I am a big tiger, confess from wide, resist from strict!' Then hit yourself a slapping. \\nA person is under such pressure, that is not dead will be crazy! \\nOn the second day of the visit to the Inland Revenue Bureau, the whole Kunming city set off the climax of the movement, and the various units fluttered and played the tiger. The inside is the massive appearance of torture to extract confessions. \\nMany tigers confess under high pressure and torture to confess their crimes. They originally wanted to admit that they passed. Who knew was followed by dirty. In chasing dirty, a large number of tigers turned their confessions, and several people committed suicide. Almost every unit managed the finance department, the department responsible for supply and marketing and the catering department played a tiger. Some tigers hit this way. Give you the food account, check the daily menu, as long as you find out the loopholes in one day, then chase it up until you admit that you have embezzled food money. Then, on the basis of that day, you must be so corrupt every day. If you have a meal for a year, multiply the amount of embezzlement for one day by 365. If you embezzled 3 yuan a day, more than 1,000 yuan a year, you become a tiger. And so on, all sorts of tigers appear. \\n12: Contact Zhou Baozhong\\nFebruary 1952, Kunming People's Victory Hall. \\n8:00 p.m., the people's victory hall was filled with the staff of all commercial industries in Kunming. I chaired the meeting at the podium, and Zhou Baozhong, Vice-President of the People's Government of Yunnan Province, sat on the podium. The horizontal label on the venue reads: Kunming shop staff report five poisons conference. \\nAs the captain of the Kunming Business System Five Counter Task Force, I made a mobilization report at the meeting, calling on everyone to actively participate in the Five Counters' Movement, fight off the rampant attack of the bourgeois, and draw the line with capitalists, denouncing illegal capitalists for tax evasion, tax evasion, labor cuts, bribes, theft of national economic intelligence, theft of state economic intelligence, theft of countries Five poisonous acts of home property. \\nShop staff one after another enthusiastically reported on stage, more than an hour of meeting, a total of hundreds of related materials, I am very excited. \\nZhou Baozhong came to attend the meeting on an ad hoc basis. He heard that there was such a meeting, he asked the Secretary to find me and said he was coming to attend. I could not report this matter to the municipal committee, so none of the leaders in the city came. At the end of the conference, he walked up and shake my hands enthusiastically with me, a 21-year-old tiger captain, and asked me to report directly to him on the progress of the sport every day from today. I met him several times when I welcomed the PLA into town, but I did not speak to him, and this time I was very impressed by his smile and warmth. Who knows this soon became the reason for me being whole. \\nAfter Zhou walked, I and Luo Lang, reporter of the Yunnan Daily, wrote for the newspaper. It was mainly written by me. He participated in the opinion and dropped the names of two people. These days, the five counter-reports I write have become the headlines of the Yunnan Daily almost every day. \\nReflections\\nThe massive whistleblower campaign frightened the owners of various industries. In fact, what they are afraid of is not their own five poisonous behavior, and the general store, even if a little problem, is nothing more than a small amount of tax evasion. What they fear is overfire in the sport. Because at this time in Kunming, the three anti-movements of various organs are on fire, and the news of torture to extract confessions is flying all over the sky. Store owners can't figure out their future, and people are dismayed. \\nThe vast majority of stores in Kunming are small owners, except for couples, other stores but one or two workers or shop clerks, most of them have a good relationship with the boss, and now everyone faces a major choice: whether to stand on the side of the boss or stand to the government side to participate in the prosecution and whistle. After many years, I still haven't figured out how many people were actually involved in the prosecution and the boss to draw the line, and how many people were playing oboe with the boss. This problem does not exist in the industrial system, because a factory has many workers, and it is generally impossible for them to have close contact with their bosses. \\nThere are also a small number of child labourers in the shops, a group of whom are insulted and tortured by their bosses, who are particularly active in the sport, and some of them hit their bosses. \\nThere was a marked depression in the market due to the unease of the store owners. The situation is similar throughout the country. Peng Zhen proposed in Beijing to divide five categories of households in private industry and commerce: full law-abiding households, basic law-abiding households, semi-law-abiding and semi-law-abiding households, serious illegal households, and completely illegal households. Mao Zedong agreed to this approach. The Kunming Municipal Committee held a general meeting of the people to announce this policy, and most small owners have come to mind. \\nWith the development of the movement, my focus has gradually shifted to large merchants in Yunnan, mostly prominent celebrities in Yunnan society. \\n13/Death of Crown Park Boss\\nMarch 1953, municipal meeting room. \\nMunicipal Committee urgent notice: 8:00am to attend the important meeting. At that time, I was no longer the head of the team. Recently, to strengthen the team, a large number of army officers, mostly at the battalion level, were brought in. A regiment appointed the team leader, and I changed to the Task Force's branch secretary. \\nThe meeting was held. Ma Jikong, secretary of the Municipal Committee, was angry. He stared at the cadre of all the city's five anti-movement leaders who participated in the meeting and said, 'Guansheng Garden dead! You know you don't know?' \\nI was crashing in my head. Well, it was not easy to calm down, before knowing that yesterday night, two battalion-level officers presided over a fighting conference in Guansheng Garden, and criticized the boss until late in the night, and killed people alive. \\nAfter Ma Jikong finished his speech, everyone expressed their opinions. I said one sentence: 'I have always stressed that no wheel warfare is allowed.' Ma Jikong suddenly roar; 'What else do you say, you have a lot of responsibility!' \\nI was very nervous and I didn't dare to go down. But the heart is very impeccable. I think, the cadres of workers and farmers in these units are much older than me and are much older, they have never admired me, never rest assured of my words, I do not command them at all. Until force cadres come to the Task Force, we rarely even hit people in our business system. \\nReflections\\nThis was the first time in my life I had a dead person in my life in a leading position. I don't even know what they have to do, but I am always one of the main team leaders, and I always have a responsibility. \\nThe dispatch of troops to participate in the five anti-movement is a central directive, aimed at letting the cadres of the army understand the reality of a rampant attack by the bourgeois. The problem is that army cadres, especially those at lower levels, are not familiar with the characteristics of urban work, and they have moved a set of rural landlords. In parallel with the participation of army officers in the Task Force, a number of university students were also present. This is also the instructions of the Central Committee. At that time, it was not as opposed to the whole university students, and then considered college students as their own people. However, students generally only listen to force cadres, and they rarely speak only. \\nLater, a few days later, Ma Jikong found out that we were afraid in our hearts, shrunk down, and held a meeting to comfort everyone. He said, 'Death will die, there is no big deal, people are dead all over the country, not just Kunming, Kunming business system is only one dead, much better than other places, everyone wants to open up. Do it with hands and feet, do not carry the burden. \\nSince the Guansheng Park incident, the army cadres have changed, and they have more respect for my opinion. But some people hate me because I have repeatedly criticized the Koonsengen incident. \\n14/Humiliation\\nIn March 1952, an auditorium. \\nUnlike in the past, this day, Li, one of the leaders of the Kunming Municipal Committee, and Chen Fang, head of the Provincial Committee of the United Front Committee, came to the venue. There are two floors of the venue, and they all watched on the second floor. \\nFollowing the instructions of the municipal committee, I am the actual organizer of this campaign. The conference moderator is the head of a shop staff union. Before the meeting, Li said to me: The main purpose of this meeting is to knock down the majesty of Yunnan big capitalists and let them sweep the ground. In response to this request, I made a deployment among workers clerk activists. \\nAt nine o'clock, more than twenty famous personalities in Yunnan, known as the big capitalists, Wu Tixian, Bixi, Wang Shaoyan and Dong Renming were taken outside the venue. The workers shouted according to the beforehand arrangement: 'In line!' 'Come in one by one!' \\nThe first pers"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "on came in. Thunder-like roar sounded at the venue: 'Bow down!' 'Bow your head down!' The man had to try to bow. Crowd and roar; 'Again low!' 'Again low!' ... in the end, he had to bend his body to 90 degrees. That's it. These social celebrities, which were also members of the CPPCC Committee members and representatives of the business and industry, came in one by one. Every time they came in, they were treated with thunder roar, and everyone bent their body into a ninety degree bow. \\n'Line up!' 'Queue!' A sound of roar. \\nMore than twenty individuals had to bend and line up close one by one. \\n'Close!' 'Close!' A piece of roar! \\nThey try to get closer, behind the person's head has topped to the front of the man's ass, mess. \\n'Move forward!' 'Leaning forward again!' To go further, is it not to allow the people behind to drill down under the crotch of the man in front? \\nI'm nervous and I think it's too much. I expressed my worries to Li and Chen Fang. Chen Fang said with a smile: do not worry, this is nothing great, will not hurt people, not die! We are much more civilized than we have in the country! \\nThat's how to fight for about an hour. At the end of the meeting, the more than 20 individuals sweat, some suddenly sat on the ground and could not stand up again. \\nReflections\\nAfter liberation, almost no one was heard talking about the word 'personality'. The intellectuals Sven swept the ground in the reformation movement. This time, it makes business and business celebrities have no face. Fortunately, in advance, I have repeatedly stressed to the staff of the workers: absolutely not to beat people, just move the mouth. Not hands-on. So there was no beating phenomenon on the venue. But this humiliation will surely make those who are battered and unforgettable for a lifetime. Who would think that a much more serious humiliation than this will fall on myself in a few years. Later, it actually fell to a large number of senior cadres and fell to President Liu Shaoqi! \\nThe Communist policy towards the bourgeois is different from that of landlords. Rural land reform is not just humiliating, but also physical destruction, killing many people. Urban Five is a personal and spiritual devastation, economic deprivation, but not many dead. \\nMao Zedong has repeatedly said that it wants to unite the national bourgeois, 'let all capitalism that is beneficial to the livelihood of the national economy have a development'. In fact, from my own history, this so-called unity was lost as early as 1952. The motivation of the private economy has become a flying ash, and smoke has dissipated. \\n15/Mother as an avatar\\nApril 1952, home. \\nMy father gave me a word and asked me to take the time to go home anyway. \\nI returned home and saw the old sister of my parents and father, who was not married, sat down in my father's room. \\n'Ah, you are finally back!' Father wants me to sit by him. 'It's like this, your big aunt did not have a good attitude towards a maid in the home before liberation, you know, big aunt is an old virgin, bad temper, is a place to do something very shouldn't be. Now the rural land reform, the farmer in the village where the maid was located has notified you to go down and accept the criticism. If you go down, you must not live. Did you hear that rural land reform, popular kneeling glass scraps, those who were criticized which is not blood on both legs, some people are killed alive...'\\n'You don't have to care for me. I die is. I will not even be tired of my brother and sister-in-law, nor will I leave the white family, I will not go to the country, and I die at home.' Big aunt firmly said. \\nA piece of silence. \\nFather looked at me with the face of asking. But I am not right. I understand that this is unescaping the misfortune. \\n'I go!' Mother suddenly said. 'I had a good relationship with the maids of the past, and I went to them wouldn't do anything to me!' \\nI feel very nervous. Mother goes down as a substitute, although it will not be killed, but kneeling broken glass and wagging are not people, how does the mother stand? \\n'Of course you'll be better, but who knows what to do with you?' The father said. \\n'No more, they will come to catch people tomorrow! I don't think they're going to do anything to me, she's sick, or if I take care of her day and night, she won't do anything about me.' The mother said. \\nI was afraid of the death of my aunt, I was afraid of my mother's suffering, and rush \\n'You go is better! Is it not to wear two thick pants, in case you want to kneel slag is better.' Father seems helpless. \\nReflections\\nThe mother went down, unexpectedly, the peasants were very polite to their mothers. The maid told the peasants, 'She was a good man. She cured me all the disease, and her son was sick several times. She was not a landlord and could not fight her. I hate that old virgin.' The maid's brother was the director of the peasant association, and her words were very weighty. \\n'She has been seriously ill and can't live for a few days. She can't come, she knows she's wrong, and she wants to confess your guilt to prostrate. Please be free to come to my house, and she will give you prostration to confess guilt. \\nLater, the development of things was completely surprising, and the farmers also invited their mother to eat and sent her home well. There is no longer asking the big aunt to go down. This is a rare exception in agrarian reform. \\nLooking back, there is also a great place for reflection on land reform. It would have been a matter of justice to engage in land reform and realize that the cultivators have their own land. However, it is quite another matter to emphasize opposition to peaceful land reform in the land reform and the violent revolution, and to emphasize Mao Zedong's Hunan Peasant Movement study report. In the land reform, the most brutal struggle is to chase money. It is difficult to say that it should be true that persons who are classified as landlords are subjected to cruel physical torture in order to pursue their wealth, causing a large number of deaths. After the Communist Party seized power, Liu Shaoqi made a 'report on land reform' nationwide. If everything is done according to the policy of the report, then there will be no brutal struggle in the land reform, nor will there be a long torment to the ground or rich. Mao Zedong stressed his opposition to peaceful land reform and stressed that the use of violence to carry out land reform is actually completely unnecessary. He said otherwise, peasants cannot turn over completely, productivity will not be truly liberated, and it is also a strong rhetoric. Have Taiwan and India implemented peaceful land reform, and land reform using the method of ransom, have not freed productivity too! The cost of land reform with massive loss of life and the long-term suffering of tens of millions of people will inevitably lead to a negative conclusion by history. \\n16/Whistle Confession Climax\\nApril 1952, Kunming senior clerk class. \\nThis day, the whole class was boiling, and it was surprising that the cronies of big capitalists-senior staff of major firms-began to report a large number of capitalist criminal materials involving high amounts of money. \\nAfter the five anti-movement entered the 'aggressive stage' of siege of the big capitalists, the municipal committee directed the establishment of senior staff study classes to bring together senior staff in the major firms in possession of financial secrecy and implement a closed 'learning'. This is in fact confinement, exerting strong pressure on them to account for the internal secrets of the major firms. I am assigned as the class leader. \\nAccording to the experience of Bo Yibo (the country's head of command of the five insurgents), in Shanghai, senior staff both belong to the proletarian side and the bourgeois side, exert certain pressure on senior staff. I raised them in the class with the slogan, 'Return to the embrace of the working class', which was exactly in keeping with the spirit of the central government, and then became my guilt. \\nThere were armed PLA guards at the entrance of the course, and they were unable to step out of the gate, and they were in fact considered to some extent as their ancestors. The course is actually to educate them and put pressure on them to report and account for the economic and financial information of major firms. I have laid out among the staff, I can treat them only in spoken language, and never beating people or treating them in an insulting manner. In two full months, the results of the study were not ideal, basically no one would say anything significant; but there was no death. \\nOn this day, suddenly things changed fundamentally. Almost every senior employee exposes their boss's major illegal material, which exceeds tens of times the total illegal amount since the start of the five anti-laws, and our work has achieved a 'major victory'. \\nI reported the situation to the leaders of the municipal committee, Ma Jikong and Li, and they were also very excited. \\nThe use of these materials as a bomb to attack capitalists led to another climax in a matter of days-the high-capitalist frankness, dozens of times the amount before. \\nSoon I knew that this confession climax was national, starting from Shanghai, there was a confession climax of big capitalists across the country. \\nReflections\\nThe emergence of a whistle-blower and confession orgasm is actually a helpless strategy for capitalists and senior staff against the Communist Party under high pressure. Whistleblings and confessed materials are only the amount of material such as thick lines, without specific details and cannot withstand close scrutiny. \\nThe senior staff are actually very powerful figures, and they can serve as senior positions for big firms, of course, there are their own outlaws. There are two examples to illustrate this clever and powerful. \\nOne day, two PLA cadres came to study their relationship with large firms. They concluded that a firm must have had the issue of bribing officers of the forces. The two exporters conducted interrogative conversations to the two senior staff members, demanding that they report the officers of the army, including a number of statements of coercion and intimidation, and made no results for a full two days. The two senior staff asked to speak to me and asked the force to send a higher-ranking official before they reported. As a result, the troops sent a colonel. The two clerks told the colonel: 'Firms do have bribes to officers, but the bribery is partly done through the two outsiders you sent.' The colonel immediately called his family and sent a jive car to get the two outposted personnel back. \\nI was very skeptical that there was an article, but the Colonel of the army did not listen to me. Later at the end of the class, the two senior staff told me: they pressed us two days and nights, and we couldn't have to pull them down. \\nAnother thing is much more serious. In the climax of the study class report, a point was made, saying that Yunnan big capitalists had organized an anti-Communist secret group called 'Southwest Anti-Republican Salvation Army'. The list they have drawn up brings all major capitalists in Yunnan into the network, holding key positions such as Commander in Chief and Chief of Staff. I was surprised and immediately reported to Li, and Li was also surprised and very excited. He immediately took me with me to go to the municipal committee secretary Ma Jikong. Fortunately, Ma was very calm. He simply did not believe such a complaint, and ordered Li and I not to trace the matter again. \\nI gradually calmed down and found that the report flaws were exhaustive, could not withstand the scrutiny. I took the whistleblower and asked them what it was. They replied: 'After more than a month of learning, it is perfectly possible to experience the Chinese Communist Party's intentions, which is to wipe out the bourgeois. Otherwise, why should we force everyone to report important materials, where there are so many important materials. Since it is to destroy the bourgeois, it's better to simply turn them into a counter-revolution, lest everyone go around day and night to patchwork the five anti-material. This is the performance of our increased awareness, and we believe that our leadership must be very satisfied.' \\nI was stunned. It's natural to think afterwards. It is entirely reasonable to create the impression that the 'Five Counters' campaign is to wipe out the bourgeois. \\n17/First try bitterness\\nMay 1952, a conference room. \\nOne of the leaders of the Kunming Municipal Committee, Li Mou held a meeting of all the staff of the 'Five Counter Task Force' business brigade. About 50 people focused on fire to criticize me, calling it a small wind. He said that a number of people in the Task Force, especially the force cadres, had many opinions about some. Bai is a little intellectuals, and there are many serious problems in the ideological style. When the 'Five Counters' movement is concluded, focusing on a few days of rectification, criticizing him, is part of summing up the whole work. He called on everyone to take the floor. \\nPeople came to power one by one at the direction of the leadership to expose and criticize me sharply. My questions revealed are mainly some of the following issues:\\n"}

After liberation, he disguised positive, mixed into the party, and feared that there was a bad impression on the organization, he was everywhere. For a long time, he felt that joining the party did not achieve the purpose of individualism. He often pretended to be very uncomfortable.

According to media reports, on May 3, 1958, at the expanded Politburo meeting of the CPC Central Committee, it was announced that the anti-right movement had achieved a phased victory by capturing 3,178,470 right-wing elements, 1,437,562 center-right, 4,616,032, including 278,932 members of the movement Often died 4,117 people. Indeed, the anti-right movement came to an end in the spring of 1959. Our county-Fengjie County, Sichuan Province, early 1959, teachers focused on winter holidays, and also caught a group of 'leaking right'. How many rightists have been caught across the country? According to the media, more than 40,000 were sentenced and 480,000 were sent to re-education through labour. As far as I know, a batch of dismissal from public office sent to agricultural societies or industrial and mining supervision and transformation, and a number of dismissals send living expenses to agricultural, forestry and pasture farms, industrial and mining units to supervise and reform, and the former 'dignitaries' removed from their jobs. How much should I total? \\nWhile 'organizing forces to counter the right', the method of 'winding and social teaching' in enterprises and ethnic minorities, as well as students in secondary schools, is to 'enlarge the debate' in rural areas. In 'Big Ming', participants are queued by four categories: one, strong and positive in socialist loyalty; two, better; three categories, serious resistance to socialism; and four, anti-socialist right. The so-called 'big debate' is actually organizing the masses to wrestle with people classified as four categories. Later, the Central Committee issued documents that did not draw the right among workers, peasants and secondary school students, known as 'anti-socialists'. According to our county party history, 3,752 rural community members (excluding workers, urban residents and secondary school students), in the county were classified as 'four categories' were criticized. They do not call the 'right,' and enjoy some of the treatment of right-wing elements: workers, 'anti-socialists' among farmers are viewed as 'bad', and 'anti-socialists' among secondary school students expelled from school. \\nOur county is a poor mountain county with few intellectuals, and in the 1950s, primary and secondary school teachers needed to be transferred from other counties. The 'results' of the anti-right movement are also amazing! According to County Zhi records, '934 people in the county were designated as 'rightists. '' As far as I know, this is just the number on the 'right-wing roster'. Actually over 1,000 people. First, the right wing of the former private business sector (such as Liu Mu, the boss of the Chinese medicine store 'Tongchangxiang'), did not take the national wage, did not get on the 'right-wing roster', and it was handled by the Federation of Industry and Commerce. It was done with the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and paid only the cost of living; second, there were several literacy teachers (such as Bao bowei Wei, etc.), who were literate in rural areas and dealt with the right when they The dispatch was 'devolved labor exercise' and actually enjoyed the same treatment as other right-wing parties, and some were 'streamlined' home. \\nIn 1979, the right 'rectified' and reinstated the original salary scale.

We hate the system of exploitation of human beings, and we embrace the great ideals of communism as the goal of lifelong struggle. But what we are now trying to build is a liberal and democratic socialist society. What we want is to do is an active builder rather than a socialist machinery. To that end, we must fight to eliminate the bureaucracy. \\nSince the transition to a communist society is basically one-party dictatorship, it is precisely this shortcoming that makes the party more necessary (than capitalism), to give the people full freedom of opinion, press and assembly, so that party policies are often placed under the supervision of the people's masses. Consult with the people (Note 1), such a policy only with the consent of the majority It is correct and feasible. When policies are implemented, the Party must also regularly accept the views of the people to revise them in a timely manner. We ask the party to give more freedom to the press (Note 2). Newspapers (at least part), should be the forum of the people and not all party billboards. We hope that the party will keep the country's economic construction (apart from having military significance to keep the enemy confidential), and often tell the people to accept the influence of public opinion. At the moment we would like to know:\\n(1), The real reason for the general lack of information on various types of living materials, such as farmers' cooking oil, is now reduced to four or two per person per month, interpreting it as 'consumption growth greater than production growth' or 'the great natural disasters of the last year' are unsatisfactory, and this lack has nothing to do with farmers' cooperation Department, if relevant, how the party intends to modify its cooperation policy. \\n(2), We doubt whether the Soviet Union has given us 'aid' or 'trade' (Note 3). Therefore, we hope that the Party will inform the people of the total amount of major substances exported between China and the Soviet Union in recent years. (I don't agree with that. Liu Zhiping)\\nFinally, we are anxious to reassess Stalin. Stalin's bloody practice of persecuting upright communists (note 4, note 5), has aroused great anger. We believe that this terrorist act of exclusion is not 'he himself considers to be for the benefit of the proletarian' The root cause of Stalin's major mistakes in military, diplomatic, agricultural and so forth comes down to' 'Personal worship' is wrong with Stalin's personal qualities. It should be said that the creation of such a Stalin was the result of the dictatorship that was gradually developed under the objective circumstances of the struggle (internal war imperialist armed interference), and on the basis of such an objective system, it was possible to generate a subjective ideology-personal worship-that would make Stalin Poor human qualities develop into people who dare to persecute people. To ensure that similar events will not occur in the future only if the system is completely eliminated, a political system that is incompatible with the socialist superiority of the economic system. On the contrary, the system is not extinguished, the roots of personal worship still exist, and after a certain year, Stalin II is still to emerge in the process of building communism. \\nWe talked about this in the winds movement because we wanted to point out that the elimination of bureaucracy could not be thought alone, but an anti-subjective education could not be considered sufficient. Bureaucratic bureaucratic systems must be eliminated together, liberal and democratic socialist systems must be built. Only such political systems can be adapted to the economic foundations of socialism, much broader than capitalist states in a society like ours where there are no confrontational class contradictions of liberal democracy is completely possible. Chairman Mao proposed at the Supreme State Council that 'one hundred families contested' and 'flowers are in full swing' The policy, said that the leadership comrades of the Party Central Committee believe in the people. On the path of building liberal socialism, people have long been the source of your inexhaustible strength. \\nBao chengguang Liu Zhiping\\nNote: This is the material sent by my comrade Bao chengguang during his rest and recuperation in the countryside, the main part of which I agreed and therefore signed. (This note is added by Liu Zhiping). \\nNote 1: The policy here includes a number of small things, such as the advice of a scientist for choosing a Loussu student, and an assistant professor should seek the advice of the professor. \\nNote 2: Khrushchev once said that the press censorship of the Soviet Union was necessary, the real news would be published, false... would not be registered, but I think it was true to them that it would be beneficial to them, and the disadvantage would not be allowed, for example, China's hundreds of contests would not be allowed. \\nNote 3: This suspicion arises on the basis that previously Poland's dealings with the Soviet Union were unequal. \\nNote 4: We would like you to add specific information. \\nNote 5: Khrushchev made a report in the party to expose Stalin's sin, and finally he ordered 'not to publish outside the party, because you cannot wash dirty things in front of the enemy'. But the report was stolen by the US espionage agency and published in most newspapers in the capitalist system. The publication of this document has had a huge international impact (Eastern European events), and the recent response to a reporter's question attempted to give the impression that 'he has not made this report' but is still not convincing for the following reasons:\\n(1), If it is false, such an extremely slanderous defamation, why does he not immediately make serious rumors, at least at the time of the events in Eastern Europe, and not informally until recently, 'denied' when questioned. \\n(2), He said that it was not possible to read the masterpiece of Dulles. And if he really didn't read the masterpiece, then he could not be sure that it was not one of his speeches, but completely fabricated. \\n(3), Gomulka referred to this article in his speech. \\nI don't think we need to wash dirty things in front of our enemies, but we must tell the people the truth that the wrong party to the people is the brave and greatest party. \\n"},

(Press: Cui Xinde wrote the words 'no basis for bullying' in Bao chengguang's article 'All for liberal democracy socialism' after 'We doubt the Soviet Union's aid or trade to our country'), So I hope you will put your objections on another paper. I would like to add my personal opinion as follows:\\n(1), I believe that the basis for 'bureaucracy' should not be said to be subjective. For it is only on the basis of an objective existence-a bad political system-that the 'Lord' inevitably grows into an 'official.' \\n'Officials' are not brought about by the socialist system, because 'officials' have long been out at the stage of human history. On the contrary, due to the superiority of the socialist economic system. Because of the sharp contradiction between collective ownership of the means of production and political monopoly dictatorship, it is entirely possible to eliminate 'officials' in a socialist society. \\n'Officials' should be based on a bad political system, the more serious the lack of a democratic political system 'officials', the harder it will be. \\n(2), To completely eliminate 'bureaucratic-' the party will need to consider changing or adding certain systems. The recent decision to 'receive people's visits and letters' and 'hold regular non-party talks' as a kind of formulation is a good start. But that is not enough. \\n(3), The party should inform the people of more information about the country;\\n(4), 'shall' the people be given full freedom of opinion. so that the Party's policies are often under the supervision of 'people's opinion'. For example, the impact of cooperation last year on the development of agriculture and the living standards of farmers in our country. The situation of foreign trade (total imports and exports, prices of major imports and exports, etc.), tells the people that the people have a correct understanding of 'whether the national conditions for cooperation are most mature', 'the size of USSR trade to China, and the nature of aid'. The more correct and comprehensive the people's understanding of the country's situation, the more they can exercise their democratic rights, influence the policies of the country, and trust and support their Governments. \\n(5), The democratic centralization system should be strengthened-broad democracy, on which the institutions that can represent the will of the people should have the highest power, and the party should lead these institutions, but power should be transferred from the party to these institutions. \\nFor example, the School Committee of Peking University does not have authority, and major matters are decided by several people, including secretary Jiang, but it is difficult to say that several of them represent professors, faculty, students and staff in a comprehensive manner. Such concentration is therefore contrary to the principle of democratic centralization. \\n(6), The party again evaluates Stalin, analyzing the subjective and objective factors that he made mistakes and the most fundamental cause is of great significance to the anti-official movement, because he is 'bureaucratic'. \\nThe struggle against the idea of materialism is long. We cannot be sure that communist society will have no subjectivity, but we can be sure that as long as bureaucratic foundations are eliminated and a broader liberal democratic system is established, then bureaucracy is on the path to communism Will not appear. \\nBao chengguang June 10, 1957\\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attachment IV]Bao chengguang: Speeches at the first and second symposia in one room\\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Appendix 5] Bao chengguang: Speech at the Fourth Debate in Rooms 1 and 3\\nIt is unwarranted to say that I often go to Peking University to see big print newspapers. I have not gone to Beijing for a long time. For example, Tan Tianrong, Lin Xiling and other large print newspapers have not seen, but only the secret report of Khrushchev, and Chairman Mao made at the Supreme State Council on the issue of the hundreds of disputes and the flourishing of flowers. Saying:\\nFirst, public opinion within the people is not carried out enough, the atmosphere of free debate is not enough in political and scientific terms, and the people's public opinion is not free enough, and it is not conducive to socialist construction. If you think the freedom of the past is enough, then you can see that the People's Daily has changed significantly in the recent period. \\nNot enough democracy is the presence of bureaucracy, it's the repression of democracy, and that's where I say it's not democratic enough. \\nSecond, the so-called announcement is to publicize the Party's policies and resolutions. As a Party newspaper, it is absolutely necessary to publicize the policies and resolutions of the Party, but there are many other newspapers that should be used as a tool to educate the people and carry out public opinion more widely. If I describe the newspaper as a party's billboard, this is detrimental to the leadership of the Party This is the right-wing speech, but I said it shouldn't be all billboards, in the past newspapers. Dogmatism exists, people's public opinion is not enough. It is wrong to describe the newspaper in the past as a party's billboard. Chu Anping once said this, I thought it was an editor. At that time, I only felt that this was a sharp exaggeration, and I did not think it was a right-wing speech. At that time, these right-wing statements had not been exposed, many People were not able to distinguish it well, so I used the term 'party billboard'. \\n3. The reasons for the lack of materials have already been very clear in Premier Zhou's report, mainly because last year's state investment, especially capital investment, was too large, and because of the natural disasters and the increase in consumption last year. This is a secondary reason. Cooperative policies are correct and basically do not need to be modified, but there are also Where the problem is wrong, where there is a problem, can be modified, how to modify, Chairman Mao I cannot say anything more specifically in the report of the report. \\nIf the problem is not related to cooperative policies, then it should be implemented, and if there is a bad production relationship, then modify the production relationship, such as increasing the place of retention, etc. \\nThe Party's policy is placed under the supervision of the masses. This is a matter of the masses line. If implemented well, the Party's policy can be fully placed under popular supervision. This requires establishing a series of systems to ensure that, for example, the People's Congress should become a forum to reflect the views of the people, and people's opinion should be fully carried out, bureaucrats righteousness should be overcome and so forth. \\nThe economic foundation of socialism has always been evolving. Therefore, the political system as the superstructure also needs to constantly develop, in order to keep pace with the development of the economic foundation. A system that was originally suitable today is not appropriate. The democratic dictatorship system of our people has been developing for a long time, for example, financial management The system is not suitable for the moment, and there will soon be a major change, so the system It is not constant, but constantly changing, and if a system's flaws allow bureaucracy to emerge, then it is incompatible with the foundations and should be eliminated. \\nThe creation of bureaucracy cannot be thought alone, but on an objective basis. I call this objective based on the bureaucratic system. I have repeatedly said this is inappropriate. People misunderstand that this is the basic system of the country and the democratic dictatorship system of the people. The reason for bureaucracy is partly the system itself, and part is where the system is not perfect, such as the large administrative structure and the concentration of power At the central level, the views of the people cannot be well reflected upward through large institutions, and the central power is too centralized. The system set out above is appropriate, while limiting the motivation that concentration of power, combined with the subjectivity of some staff, can become bureaucratic. Examples of the bureaucratic system of the system itself, such as the work system that affected solidarity and the former Soviet system of corporate governance, were examples of the system itself. \\nThere are other systems that do not create bureaucracy in themselves, such as the meeting system. But if there are too many meetings, leaders cannot reach out to the masses, produce subjectivity, paperalism, transactivism. The secrecy system is too strict, then the following people know too little, and there will be little supervision over the above. \\nI have always stressed that it is not only ideological but from the flaws of these systems, and that bureaucratic systems can be eliminated if they are to be abolished and supplemented. \\nThe establishment of 'liberal democracy socialism' that I mentioned was initially rather hollow, and I thought that these systems could make our socialism more liberal and democratic. So I called it liberal and democratic socialism. Now I wanted to hold regular non-party symposia and the workers' congresses. The revision of the party statutes provides that some bottom-up criticism and supervision are necessary systems, The wider spread of democracy. \\nStarting from the interests of the bourgeois, in order to achieve his ambitions and push China to the path of capitalism, I am trying to build socialism well, not stand on the bourgeois standpoint, there is no personal purpose, not to push China into capitalism. In my letter, I mentioned building socialism. The people are the inexhaustible source of the Party, of course you can say that this is both factions, but I Always do not like both factions. \\nI said that newspapers should not be all party billboards. Why would it be advantageous, and I opposed it, because the party's policy could not all be correct. If the party policy is wrong, someone opposes, then the editors will feel bad...\\nFor example, there is no doubt that the provisions on the area of cultivation of agricultural crops are dead, and it takes a year to raise criticism. If abortion has not been objected to in the past, it has not been possible until recently, the party's policy is not 100 percent correct, and the party itself admits that if the people of a certain policy have opinions, but because of the fact that the people of a particular policy have an opinion, In order to benefit from disadvantage, it is not registered, and the result prevents the people from giving opinions. \\nPeasants have grievances, mainly because the Party's policies are incorrect, and the opinions of the people may be somewhat favorable and some unfavorable. \\nBy simply saying that the newspaper is a party's billboard, this cannot explain the problem. Chuanping is the right, because there are other remarks in its area, and I do not. I suggested that newspapers should not be billboards for public opinion, as I wrote in my second letter, 'The more correct and comprehensive people are aware of the situation in the country, the more they can exercise their democratic rights, the more they can influence the country's policies, the more trust and support their own government.' I believe that the Party believes in the people, and the people are willing to contribute their own strength under the leadership of the Party to make progress towards communism. \\nFrom this sentence alone (the newspaper is the party's billboard), I can't see my motive. I mean, in addition to being a party propaganda tool, the newspaper should also have bottom-up supervision. 'At least a part of the people's forum, not all party billboards' is wrong, as if the party newspaper was in the past. All are party billboards. Chu Anping's remarks, I can't tell, think it is an exaggerated and sharp statement, is that the position is not stable, and does not have enough trust and love for the Party. Although I acknowledge the Party leadership and believe that the power of the people is an inexhaustible source of building socialism, trust in the party is not enough, so I raised some doubts. As for saying that, according to some inferences, I am opposed to the party's resolution, and welcoming anti-socialist remarks is not in line with the truth. I did not have this idea. This is totally negated to me, pushing me to the anti-socialist right, and there is no benefit. \\n(My remarks and savings), did not coincide with it, but was influenced by him. Specifically, I am different from him. It is not enough to look at it from all aspects. Why do many of the right not deny that they are the right? It's because they have made a lot of words to drag China to capitalism, and my letter is to make socialism better. Why didn't I stand on the bourgeois position, I wrote at the beginning of the letter that I hated the system of exploiting people, which shows that I am very discouraged by capitalist production relationships. \\nI am not on the proletarian position, not a bourgeois position. \\nIt is a matter of two things not to stand on the proletarian position, and to stand on the bourgeois position. It is an internal matter for the people to stand against socialism from the bourgeois position. To say this (saying that I stand on the bourgeois position), is that there is no distinction between people and enemies. \\nI think bureaucracy, not just thinking, should be linked to the system, such as posting it out and discussing it, it is also good for everyone to criticize. \\nThe Party's remarks are not always correct, and the opinions of the majority of the people are even less comprehensive enough, so criticism is also needed. \\nPeople's public opinion will not be able to subjectively decide on advantages and disadvantages. I think this is still right. \\nLet me turn to Stalin's success. The achievements of the Soviet Union after the October revolution should be attributed to the correct political lines set by Lenin and the superiority of the Soviet socialist system. If Stalin has a credit, it is only that he adheres to Lenin's political line, Lenin has proposed Stalin's position, and if another person is changed, the Soviet achievement could be even greater. I think Stalin delayed the pace of development of the Soviet Union, he did not care about the improvement of farmers' lives in agriculture, concentrated power at the center of industry, weakened local enthusiasm, and in the Patriotic War, Germany was able to quickly occupy the major industrial and agricultural areas, making Suu The resistance of the people of the United States has suffered great difficulties. From the perspective of the rapid development of the post-war economy, it can also be seen that his response to the Soviet Union The slowing effect of development. \\nAfter the revolution, some State systems had not been consolidated, and the emphasis on concentration in this context led Stalin to undermine the democratic centralization and socialist rule of law, and, of course, his personal qualities. Stalin's authoritarian system of work, which I said to be eliminated, such as the industrial one-long system and the agricultural collective farm planning system, are all called bureaucratic systems. It was also pointed out in the 're-theory' that the establishment of systems was necessary, but did not link Stalin's undermining of democratic centralization. \\nOn the issue of the party's removal of power. I believe that the party is a political leader and cannot replace administrative tasks, such as the specific affairs of the school should not be interfered with by the party; the supreme organ should be the school committee, not the party committee. Does such a formulation weaken the party's leadership? No, it is only the Communist Party that takes socialism, and can represent the basic lines of the people's politics. The Communist Party can lead State organs, and power should be in these organs, and also in the hands of the Party. Many specific things are not familiar to the Party. If the party arranges instead of administrative work, it is not necessarily 100 percent wrong. I mention this because there are places where there is the fact that party managed administration. \\nOn the issue of making people mechanical, I'm not referring to real machinery, I mean that people's motivation cannot develop. Bureaucracy is based on commandmentism, which develops, only by command, can not play an active role, and people become mechanical. Excessive secrecy systems are not conducive to bottom-up monitoring by people. Without knowing anything, it is difficult to achieve supervision. In this way, bureaucracy can grow. Big industrial production has decided that the big duke of the working class is selfless, such as a painting factory holding a strike, victory, you ask what connection the strike victory has with you spray paint, is meaningless. \\nWhat I say 'dictatorship' does not mean the Soviet system; some of Stalin's work systems I call it 'dictatorship'; the growth of personal worship makes him more authoritarian and authoritarian. The system itself offers only a possibility of developing ideas, and a person who has an intellectual malfunction, coupled with such a system, fosters bureaucracy. Leaders like Lenin are few, so eliminating Stalin's mistakes requires an institutional approach. Stalin once said Voroshilov was a British spy, saying that he had a basis for his exclusion. \\nTo say that Stalin's exclusion is that I read the secret report of 'Hh'. Why do I believe that the news published by the United States is true? From the answer to the reporter's question, it is not certain that it is true or false. I assume that it has three possibilities: (i), false; (ii), exaggerated; (iii), true; first suppose false 'heh', and it should be denied at the time of such a slanderous thing, nor should I speak to reporters with the same tint as 'I did not continue Dulles's masterpiece.' \\nI believe that in terms of the Party Central Policy, there is no need to believe in some details. For cooperation I'm just wondering if the conditions are ripe, not cooperation itself. \\nWhat was not satisfied was China's assessment of Stalin, which gave credit to the primacy, and, moreover, was not linked to the system at the time.

After the anti-right editorial, his sensory organs than anyone else, immediately detected the wind direction wrong, when it was unfavorable, so, silently, quietly left school.

Instead, he pleaded everywhere that he had no problems, and the school had wronged him, this good man. And bragging and saying, I will go back and count with them. However, in the end, 'to be a thief', sneaky everywhere to ask about the anti-right struggle at schools, and went to Anhui, Nanjing, Shanghai, Xuzhou, Jinan and other places, while listening to the movement, hiding, seeking funding, several attempts to betray the motherland and fled to Hong Kong.

Come to a look, he lost color said: 'finished!' So, again absconded, and wrote a point for his wife Zhang Global's 'Deadline Book', and also wrote a point for Ni Chunhua, claiming that he had committed suicide. Wandering outside for two nights a day, no way back to school. \\nThe early anti-party words and deeds\\nBefore the wind, Bao, the right-wing activist, learned the news of the party's winds from his school (outside)'s 'souls' long ago. So, he was secretly delighted and cried in the basement of the study hall: 'Party members are afraid of the whole wind, and this is enough for them! They are not ruthless!' When the group began to learn the whole wind file, he said, 'There's something to learn, it's not enough.' It was proposed to hold a full class session, first give advice to the party, otherwise refused to attend the meeting, the result really withdrew to show (protest). After the wind began, he shouted all over and said: 'It was wrong to pursue him within the anti-China regiment, and this was a sectarianism that struck him. 'Anti-Summarization' is the formula, is a dogma and must be redone.' Comrade Shi Zhe came to our school report, he said: 'Talking to clear the history is also achievements, so why not check it? This is simply a Q.' In addition, he insisted that 'black material ('autobiography', 'identification, etc.)' and 'there is no need for secrecy in universities'. He said publicly at the conference: 'Party members have the highest power, one party member can decide the life and death of others!' 'Party members have a wand in the hands of all things.' He attacked the Soviet Union, attacked Stalin and Chairman Mao, saying: 'Personal worship has become a culture, and also for Chairman Mao!' More instigators of dissatisfaction with the party said: 'Don't say now, when to say, the more sharp, the better, I give you support' to act as a shameful role of the anti-party 'boss'. \\nOrganization of anti-party group 'history of three groups'\\nWhen the 933 physics team, the anti-party, 'Democratic newspaper', published, he clapped his hands quickly and immediately planned with right-wing elements and those with serious right-leaning sentiments, and to respond to the big print newspaper. On the evening of May 31, he personally drew up 14 general anti-party newspapers and formed the 'history of the three people' anti-party group. On June 1, when their anti-party newspaper ran across the school, another part of my class organized a 'family in history three' to 'fight' to criticize their anti-party arguments. They were angry, in order to bluff, sent Zhu Huanhao, Chen Sidong, Wang Xianxin and other minions to liaise around to siege 'one of the history three', cursing them as 'countercurrent'. Not only that, the opposition group also usurped the Editorial Committee of the Three Walls of History, put their members and sympathizers into the branch of the regiment, planned a 'democratic forum for history' and called for the creation of tools such as 'sounding bars' to attack the party. \\n'Qingdao Daily' event planner\\nHe is not only the leader of the anti-party group, the 'history three group', but also a conspirator and planner of the newspaper. When conspirators both inside and outside the school jointly launched on June 3, after the newspaper incident, he was happy and clapped! Immediately plunge planner, repeatedly insisted the mastermind said: 'To farther it must be organized!' 'I have no rhetoric, must participate.' And threatened: 'I know all about the Qingdao Daily. I want to go to the democratic forum to shake the material out and ask them to taste.' So gracious, jumped into the pulpit, and later he came down again for some insidious purpose. Immediately summoned an investigation committee of right-wing elements Xu Zhibang, Zhang Chuanzeng, Yu Zhanxue and other organizations to change their names, make up investigations, and the people who wanted to find a protection (cannot be identified here), 'Qingdao Daily' are evidence bought by the newspaper in order to make a big deal and bring down the Qingdao Daily. And with the right-wing elements of the teachers, conspiracy to do the 'Democratic Daily', abolish the Qingdao Daily and replace it, or the 'chamber rivalry' with the Qingdao Daily, which has been stinned by them. \\nTear off the skin to see abalone\\nSomeone will ask, why the right-wing activist Bao satire is so rampant to attack the party? The question is well answered, as long as tear off the skin to see the bao satire, you can get the answer. Bao satian was born in a sinful, bloody large warlords family, since the age of 13, visit the kiln, running, eat wine, gamble big money, fight, buy and sell gold. More power, colluded with rogue India's 'Northeast Major' and 'Ministry of Defense II Office' titles, all over the title of the film, bump and deceive all over, all intending to be a small warlord, to be a man. After liberation, he deceived the organization and the people and mixed up into the revolutionary ranks, not only did he carry out transformations, brainstorming, exaggerating rhetoric, creating rumours, distorting policies, causing many losses to the party and the country in their work. (19), for 54 years, the aim is not to learn, but (this word can not be recognized), the title, listed, mixed (this word can not be identified), flowers, in order to be the capital of the anti-party anti-people. Not only did he despise Mr., despise his classmates, but also blindly confuse every day, handing over some of the bad elements of the anti-party, and not He is longer than touting, touting, playing hooligans playing with women, and shameless (not recognized here), it is glorious, smart, and there is a way to do it. How can an anti-party anti-people guy like this be a sweeping guy? Here, we must warn Bao that if he is not honest and pleaded guilty again, that blame is self-imposed, there is only a dead end!

He attacked the Soviet Union, attacked Stalin and Chairman Mao, saying: 'Personal worship has become a culture, and also for Chairman Mao!' More instigators of dissatisfaction with the party said: 'Don't say now, when to say, the more sharp, the better, I give you support' to act as a shameful role of the anti-party 'boss'. \\nOrganization of anti-party group 'history of three groups'\\nWhen the 933 physics team, the anti-party, 'Democratic newspaper', published, he clapped his hands quickly and immediately planned with right-wing elements and those with serious right-leaning sentiments, and to respond to the big print newspaper. On the evening of May 31, he personally drew up a programmatic 14 anti-party newspaper and set up the 'history of the three people' anti-party group. On June 1, when their anti-party newspaper ran across the school, another part of my class organized a 'family in history three' to 'fight' to criticize their anti-party arguments. They were angry, in order to bluff, sent Zhu Huanhao, Chen Sidong, Wang Xianxin and other minions to liaise around to siege 'one of the history three', cursing them as 'countercurrent'. Not only that, the opposition group also usurped the Editorial Committee of the Three Walls of History, put their members and sympathizers into the branch of the regiment, planned a 'democratic forum for history' and called for the creation of tools such as 'singing bars' to attack the party. \\n'Qingdao Daily' event planner\\nHe is not only the leader of the anti-party group, the 'history three group', but also a conspirator and planner of the newspaper. When conspirators both inside and outside the school jointly launched on June 3, after the newspaper incident, he was happy and clapped! Immediately plunge planner, repeatedly insisted the mastermind said: 'To farther it must be organized!' 'I have no rhetoric, must participate.' And threatened: 'I know all about the Qingdao Daily. I want to go to the democratic forum to shake the material out and ask them to taste.' So gracious, jumped into the pulpit, and later he came down again for some insidious purpose. Immediately summoned an investigation committee of right-wing elements Xu Zhibang, Zhang Chuanzeng, Yu Zhanxue and other organizations to change their names, make up investigations, and look for people who want to protect (protect), the 'Qingdao Daily'. It is the evidence that the newspaper has bought, in order to make a big deal and bring down the Qingdao Daily. And with the right-wing elements of the teachers, conspiracy to do the Democratic Daily, replacing the Qingdao Daily, or the 'chamber' of the Qingdao Daily, which has been stinned by them. \\nTear off the skin to see abalone\\nSomeone will ask, why the right-wing activist Bao feng satire is so rampant to attack the party? The question is well answered, as long as tear off the skin to see the bao satire, you can get the answer. Bao feng satian was born in a sinful, bloody large warlords family, since the age of thirteen went to the kiln, running the field, eat wine, gamble big money, fight, buy and sell gold. More power, colluded with rogue India's 'Northeast Major' and 'Ministry of Defense II Office' titles, all over the title of the film, bump and deceive all over, all intending to be a small warlord, to be a man. After liberation, he deceived the organization and the people and mixed up into the revolutionary ranks, not only did he carry out transformations, brainstorming, exaggerating rhetoric, creating rumours, distorting policies, causing many losses to the party and the country in their work. Since 1954, the aim is not to study, but rather (mixed), titles, listed signs, mixed (out), flowers, in order to become the capital of the anti-party anti-people. Not only did he despise Mr., despise his classmates, but also blindly confuse every day, handing over some of the bad elements of the anti-party, and not He is longer than touting, touting, playing hooligans playing with women, and shameless (not recognized here), it is glorious, smart, and there is a way to do it. How can an anti-party anti-people guy like this be a sweeping guy? \\nHere, we must warn Bao feng that if he is not honest and pleaded guilty again, that blame is self-imposed, there is only a dead end!

He was in a group of three halls. When the right-wing attacking leaders did not deal with the general problems of some responsible cadres, Baobu Chau immediately interacted in support and said, 'There are still more serious rebel mutiny among the responsible cadres, and there is no problem of blood debt to be dealt with.' In this way, a group of cadres was convinced that the leadership was sheltering senior cadres. Therefore, in the name of the whole group, the anti-party newspaper, 'Is it special for leading cadres?' \\n2. Support the activities of right-wing elements to overthrow the party committee. When right-wing activist Li Shufang and other litigated party committee members in an attempt to overthrow the Party Committee, Bai Buzhou said that 'if elections were to be held after the whole wind, some people would not be elected.' \\n3, attack, slander the leadership of the hospital. He said, 'The business policy of the hospital has been swaying for a long time, followed the public security and the court run'. He said that the party group 'collective leadership has not been formed and democratic air is thin.' He also incited that 'anti-sectarianism is not explicitly proposed in the hospital's rectification plan, is it not... everyone has a good consideration'. 'It is not good cadres who dared to raise their opinions, they will be disadvantageous everywhere.' 'Cadres or above procurators have centrifugal thinking and are not willing to work in high inspection.' \\n(3), Bai Bu Chau has a long history of serious bourgeoisie notions. He thinks that after 10 years the deputy director has not been promoted, the organization does not reuse him. So dissatisfied with the party. When the rectifying movement began, when the bourgeois right elements in society were rampant to attack the party, Baebuzhou actively instigated ignition, attacking the party and leadership, and had a serious impact in the hall, causing the entire three hall to quickly form a counter-current against the party from within the party to the party in a short period of time. Bai Bu Chau said anti-party words and deeds were revealed and criticized, although the error was admitted, but the review was not profound enough. Already, the party group decided to classify the right, and therefore decided to dismiss Baabu Chau.

()\\nBao jianchun Jianchun, the student who was expelled and arrested in accordance with the law this time, is not only an anti-socialist right-wing member, but also a rogue, a fly, a systematic stealing of bad elements with serious criminal actions, and is one of the backbone of Shaefen's right-wing gangster group. He was born in a bourgeois family, deeply endured by the decayed bourgeois ideology. He was still in secondary school, Bao jianchun Jianchun and a rogue, often ran the ballroom, went to the hall, and held and participated in a black light dance party several times (according to his own account, from 1952 to November 1957, the only time can be remembered. and place up to 37 times), and to charge dancing fee (1.5-3 yuan), to the rogue a fly, Profit from it. Hundreds of naive and ignorant teenagers of young women and girls who are tempted by them to corrode (especially a large number of secondary school girls), at prom parties have exposed hundreds of naive and ignorant teenagers to their erosion and insult. After entering the Jiaotong University, Bao jianchun Jianchun's criminal acts did not interrupt. He bragged the decay and obscene life of his classmates who were seriously backward in bourgeoisie thinking, saying what: 'Now engaging women outside, the government is not easy to know, that is, knowing that the crime is not big, youth have fun to play...' Stimulation, it is better to change a 'girlfriend' a month.' And often drag this part of the classmates to the yellow ball, eat and drink fun. Talking about women became the main part of the life of this part of the classmates. Not less than dozens of people were affected by him and Xia Efen (in this class, for example, seven were affected by Afei's 'hair salon'). Bao jianchun Jianchun not only corroded the backward classmates, but also bullied foreign students, having started beating a Fujian student in his first grade. His hooligan flight has caused the indignation of the majority of classmates! \\nBao jianchun Jianchun has a close relationship with rogue Afei elements distributed in universities (such as one medicine, second medicine, Tongji, Huafang, foreign languages...), and collaborates in criminal activities. If he had a very close relationship with Hu Jixiang, the head of the second medical rogue Afei Group, once in the basement of Hu Jixiang's family, Hu Jixiang, Hu Feixiang, Bao jianchun Jianzhen, Zhang Abel, etc., seduced her only 13 and four years old girl × ×, together to indecent her, until the girl yelled and shouted her. Go. In addition, Bao jianchun Jianchun and the jobless hooligans in the society are very close, he is also a good friend of the rogue Afei theft group 'health seven brothers'. He and Shah Efen (the head of the school's right, the head of the rogue small group have been arrested), was known through this kind of gangster Afei's kinship as early as high school. They used the three quarters 125 as a place for eating and drinking and hosting foreign men and women, and schools (clubs, catering services, general services, faculty lounges, bedrooms), as places for their theft. Just take the catering department as an example, since 1958, a large number of stealing buns (at most once up to 86), meat loose, other classmates on the table of good dishes, cheated to take two meal cards, dry them to eat white food. It is this group of bad men who made the order of the dining room a pandemonium. \\nBao jianchun Jianchun's hooligan activities are consistent, stealing is consistent, and theft is the main source of 'economic' that they use to satisfy their corrupt lives. He took advantage of the classmate bath when he stole a watch worth more than 100 yuan. After the fact, because the classmates checked very tight, and knew that he had entered the bedroom, he had to send the watch by mail to the first grade office and asked not to pursue (the letter was not named). \\nAfter that in 1955, in the classroom stealing a 12-inch triangle plate, a plastic curved plate; 1956-1957, he and Shaefen Group together with a large number of stealing bread and other food, and 'eating white food', and the 'white food' act, and received from the Shaefen Group the printing pad, books, etc.; 1957 Bao jianchun Jianchun had been taken away in the three quarters 125 room (actually Number of books and shoes a pair of books, after restructuring to use now. He also steal classmates textbooks and so on. \\nIn addition, Bao jianchun Jianchun, Xia Efen, Tao Zenglier and others have red and white school emblems only for rogue outside to enter the school gate, a serious violation of school discipline. \\nAll of our classmates in the Metallographic Four and Mechanism 44 class, feel great outrage at the consistent behavior of hooligans, Bao jianchun Jianchun, the rightist, bad men and women. We agree that Bao jianchun Jianchun corrodes the rogue activities of young men and women and their evil, seriously disrupting the social order and the state's actions against young people. Educational programs. At the same time, his acts of theft seriously hindered students' lives and violated the laws of the country. The state public security department has severely punished such a criminal and bad person in accordance with the law. We feel great pleasure."}

If you do not let go, there will be no concern. It is of course that it is not possible to rule schools or professors in controversy. Workers run factories, and professors manage schools. So the editorial volume of the People's Daily is too small. There is less brawl in the People's Daily, much more pressure. To comment immediately on the comments made by some, it is a fallacy, and I think they are afraid of criticism from the masses. Whether 17 workers in Shijingshan can represent all workers, while the People's Daily is marked with a big title; this makes people afraid, as I am speaking, would be afraid to give opinions. \\nParty members are not sincerely loyal\\nThe party should not be regarded as loyal to the Party as loyal to the Party. I think the failure of the Xinhai Revolution is the bourgeoisie leadership without socialist platform. Many people are holding up and, in turn, hit people. There is no good personnel management. There are also few people who speak entirely of conscience after liberation. These people are not immune to some speculation. If these people are allowed to climb to high positions, it will be detrimental to the country, and contradictions will develop. Undisputed, speculators or the dark side are less hit. \\nParty members talk about personal problems that arise in animal relations\\nParty members talk about personal issues, it's not the same thing; when it comes to personal interests, animal relationships arise, and scrape your money into my purse. Is proximity to party members asking for progress? I can't see it. At present, there is such a climate, which obeys leadership is progress, and what does not obey is backwardness. I don't agree, because I'm not asking for a promotion or a 'lecturer.' \\nThe Communist Party is a little bad-less free\\nThe Communist Party is a little bad-less free. \\nDo not clutter personnel work. Some people have the ability, but limit his ability to work, to eat in white. Is it bad to let him find a job? Bureaucracy is caused by undemocracy. Presented in behavior is pressure. But pressure is not only manifested in party members, but the masses also have pressure. Your experience is to feel that you can only say good words, can not say anything else. A person who is not satisfied with his job should be raised, some unreasonable should be said, but the leader should not speak. You can only say good words, not bad words, say wrong criticism. \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"}

Absolutely, it makes people have such a view of the party, believing that he is not wrong in any link. In addition, many party members' minds are deflating. Many party members are proud to use this absolute prestige to cover subjectivity, bureaucracy, sectarianism and arbitrariness. On many occasions, the leaders raise their hands without consent.

In Zunyi, the leaders of bandits who killed the Red Army and looted their belongings were tried and sentenced to death. \\nDue to the need for work, he was transferred to Kunming on October 1, 1951, and was assigned to Zhenyuan County in Pu'er area to clear the case. At this time, the Kunro railway has not yet been opened and had to walk a thousand miles \\nThere were still many bandits along the way. The Clearance Task Force reached the distance, and the 13 Army sent a platoon of PLA and two investigators to escort more than 30 cadres of them. They walked for more than ten days to reach Zhenyuan County. After 10 days of work, again received notice back, still walk more than 10 days before returning to Kunming. \\nOn the way to Pu'er, Bao zhejun Che-jun life experienced danger for the first time: starting from stone Ping on foot, by Bao zhejunxiu town to three paved a night, the next day asked him to catch a horse. He has not rushed a horse since his birth and does not know how to drive it. Walking, I don't know how to do it, this horse actually ran to a path, because it is the mountains, although he can not catch it, chase down, it jogged, chase fast, it ran fast chase chase has run several miles. There were some bandits in the hill, but he didn't think of bandits, but only wanted to get the bridle to his hand, because the horse dragged everyone's luggage. What about the horse running? He shouted his comrades in front, but they could not hear the shouting, they hurried him only to urinate, had been chasing, and the horse ran away. He could not take care of the pannies, but only buried the horse. The horse fell while picking a ditch. He took the opportunity to run to the front of the horse and stopped the naughty horse back. Go to the place where the pannies, but can't find the pannies, he thought he might be carried away by bandits, hurried to catch up with the big team. This was the other comrades told him that after hearing his shouting, the leader sent two small comrades to find the road, and the result was no man and horse, and only saw the pannies on the roadside. They thought that men and horses had been robbed by bandits, and had to carry them back. When they saw Bao zhejun Che-jun rushed back to the horse to meet with the brigade, everyone was very happy, and he was very happy. They walked on this mountain for two days to guess Yuanjiang County town. After carrying out land reform, revising land reform, revising land reform, and banning reactionary doors, he went to Yuanjiang three times this mountain, and went to fear once again, because it was too hot and tired. \\nThroughout the process of clearing, Bao zhejun Zhejun has been engaged in recording work. At that time, he was a child. He was not very aware of any revolutionary rationale, political and legal work. He only knew bandits, bullies and bullies oppressed the poor. He was not even aware of the Communist Party's mayor and the secretary of the district committee, because when the Kuomintang ruled, he only knew that there were district governors (in fact, KMT also had a branch secretary), On one occasion, he wrote the district secretary as a district governor, and was severely criticized by team leader, Comrade Wang Yueting. But at that time he was young, marching walked in front of every day, not overnight, always put everyone in the place, cooking places are looking for good, before completing the task. He returned to Kunming in December to summarize his work at the provincial public security department. He was also named a third class model. Comrade Cao Lizhou, head of the Clearance team, gave him a prize at the conference. \\nAfter summarizing the work, comrades from other organs in the Southwest Military and Political Commission returned to Chongqing. Only the personnel of the Southwest Ministry of Public Security remain in Yunnan. The provincial public security department assigned him and three other comrades to work in the Mengzi Office's Public Security Department. On February 3, 1951, his mother went to the Mongzi Public Security Department to report that he was also divided into the town counter office. The specific task is to report the cases reported by the provinces to the leaders of the Land Committee, and then send them back to the provinces for execution after the orders of the leaders of the Land Committee. During the course, he also served as a correspondent for sending and receiving, arresting prisoners, abrogating bandits. Investigation, pre-trial and other work. \\nIn the investigation of bandits, Bao zhejun Che-jun experienced a second danger. That was 1953, he participated in the new county district of Pingbian County to carry out the general purchase and sale of grain, and was divided into Tianxin Township. In fact, he did not engage in food affairs, but instead conducted investigations, because there were still some bandits in Pingbian County at that time. The Commissioner's Office organized a company to fight bandits in the county. The Public Security Department leader called him and a cadre from the Pingbian government to go into the Miao Zhai Zhai Zhai in depth investigation work. Although he wore military uniforms for three years, he was included in public security cadres without being a soldier. This time it was really on the battlefield. This time, this time, a cadre of the Pingbian County government has not only not been a soldier, but also a bandit who has changed his own life, known as the 'two-water boss'. \\nThis man was in his 40s because he understood the Miao language. He lived in and out of the bandit, only seven Miao farmers lived in the house for seven days. Every night, he did not dare to take off his clothes, the gun does not leave his hand, and his thoughts are very nervous, but a little news has not been detected. Later, Bao zhejun Zhejun proposed to go to the nearby Zhai Zi walk, which county government cadre did not object. Because he is not a public security department, consciously listening to him in command. They went out for a few days and the Director of Public Security did not see them to report, and thought they had been captured by bandits. \\nOne day they met a young woman who thought she knew in a Han zhai, who said the whereabouts of the bandits. It turns out that the bandits hiding in the big forest during the day and went back to the village at night in a woman's house overnight. The places to hide and the route they take are mastery. They returned to the commune government to report the situation, and a platoon was transferred overnight to Tianxin Township and slept during the day in the commune government, waiting for night action. Bao zhejun Zhejun proposed to go to explore the route. The county government cadre did not agree, 'Comrade Bao zhejun, you can't recognize that people in our place, a gun will definitely fall.' Bao zhejun Zechun said: 'If we don't clear the route, how do we give the right way?' He didn't insist again. He had to say, 'Okay, well, on the road to go fast. \\nThey went to the old forest of the deep mountain, and the road was deep, it was really difficult to walk. The county government cadre was nervous and accidentally fell into a wrestling. He ran up and said nervously, 'Hurry away, hurry away!' They are ambushed on the way the bandits will pass. The bandits came according to the route, just entered the ambush ring machine gun rang, but did not hit, the bandit rolled down the slope. Their hard work was wasted, and the whereabouts of the bandits were never detected. \\nThe bandit did not come back in 1954, and he said to the officers of the Public Security Bureau, 'I saw your people, wearing cadre uniforms outside, wearing military uniforms inside, must be a Scout. I would not dare to shoot him. \\nBao zhejun Che-jun did wear cadre uniforms outside, wearing military uniforms inside. The bandit is a thief, afraid of the liberation army. In fact, he was still a child who was not completely intelligible. If the bandit actually shot, he was out of the world long ago. \\nLater, he went to the village of the small water well in the area to investigate the whereabouts of another bandits. At this time only he was alone, not Dong Miao language, carrying only a beautiful revolver carrying a beautiful revolver every day to go to the old forest in the mountains. In the old forest in addition to the sounds of birds and the murmuring water in the creek, look up unseen, eerie quietly horrible. Two weeks have passed, and the news of the bandits has not been detected either. Now in retrospect, he himself is also reassuring. Young people who were educated in that era, for the benefit of the people, were not afraid of anything, and no conditions would be said! Go where you need to go. \\nAfter the anti-bandits reconnaissance work came back, Bao zhejun Che-jun seems to have grown up a lot, more knowledgeable, and the 'Collection of Mao Zedong' can also understand. On November 10, 1954, he joined the Communist Party of China and was once again named a model for the Public Security Department. He was appointed Deputy Chief of the Pre-Trial Section of the Public Security Department in 1955. However, he himself did not look at himself as an official, because in the public security organs it was not a party member who could not hold leadership positions. On the ability to work, other comrades are strong. He does not think that after being deputy section chief, his ability to work exceeds other comrades. His ability to work has yet to be improved in practice. So he was invited to unite and learn from other comrades, and he was still, as in the past, often as a reporter for them. \\nIn 1957, President Mao Zedong's 'On Correct Handling Problems of People's Internal Conflicts' was published, followed by a rectifying campaign against subjectivity, bureaucracy and sectarianism within the Party. The aim is to 'cure people before punishment and save people' by conducting criticism and self-criticism by 'wind and rain'. Beginning with the central government, the central government invites democratic parties and non-partisan democrats and intellectuals to help put the wind up and give their opinions. The People's Daily published the opinions of a number of democratic personalities. It was only after July that these opinions were called 'anti-socialist rhetoric'. Provincial authorities are also the first to rectify the wind, after the right. Before the regional wind against the right, Bao zhejun Che-jun was once again named as a model for the work of the Public Security Department and was briefed on praise within the district's public security system. At the beginning of the wind, he was the chief of the two departments of the pre-trial and re-education departments, and asked others to give opinions to the Party As for his own opinion, he has usually been mentioned, and it is not intended to repeat it. \\nThroughout the submission of the comments, the reporters were organized in a uniform manner and, curiously, they were not recorded in the name of the respondent, but in the name of the person who raised the opinion. This approach, in essence, was not intended from the outset to address the issue of the respondent, but rather that of the author, although he did not understand the intention of the leadership at the time. It is said to be called 'snake out of the hole. Unfortunately, our party has since gone a lot of detours, and the people have also made great sacrifices for this! \\nOne comrade in Kunming had warned him that people who gave advice to the leadership could easily be beaten into the right. Therefore, at first he still had some concerns, but he had repeatedly mobilized in branches, party organizations, and administrative councils, and called on party members leading cadres to lead their opinions. The secretary of the branch gave assurances at the meeting of the party that it would not fight against retaliation. He was loyal to the party and repeated his usual opinions again, not taking into account that the organization would treat himself as an enemy, and did not take into account that the consequences would be so serious. \\nAt that time, Bao zhejun Zhejun made two opinions: the first is that for the second time, a county consciously relaxed the policy boundaries and arrested some people who did not have enough counter-revolutionary standards, and at the time of sentencing had to be allowed, and social influence was not good. Chairman Mao has instructed: 'If you can catch no arrest, we will make mistakes when you catch it.' The second article is to say that after the internal rebellion began, discipline requirements for those participating in the rebellion are more stringent. In order to emphasize discipline, he said, 'This time, everyone in our team has to suspect, so everyone must strictly observe all kinds of discipline.' He thinks that counteraction is a mass movement under the leadership of the Party Committee. If everyone has to doubt, what else does the masses rely on to fight against it? There is no public opinion about this argument that everyone is suspicious. Another opinion was not raised by him. Another comrade in the group said: 'The Communist Party promotes cadres and specifically promotes the people who will tout, and ask for nothing, that is, will tout, and then promote as head of the unit.' He explained at the time: 'It cannot be said that the Communist Party's promotion of cadres will be touted, because the criteria for the Communist Party's promotion of cadres are both meritocracy, not touting. It can only be said that among the promoted people, some people have touted the phenomenon.' \\nIt was only a few days to raise opinions, he criticized Bao zhejun Che-jun. \\nThe fight against him started with big print and comics. Because the pseudonym he used is 'Wu Song'. The Ministry of Public Security systematically criticized him for the first time. Critics said: 'You describe yourself as Wu Song, you treat the party as an enemy, you are anti-party anti-socialism!' He replied: 'This time it is against subjectivity, bureaucracy, sectarianism, these things our party's ideological line enemies.' Critics say: 'You nonsense, how can subjectivity be the enemy!' He turned over the third volume of the Collection of Mao Zedong, 'Transforming Our Learning', saying: 'This anti-scientific anti-Marxist Leninist and subjective method is a great enemy of the Communist Party, a great enemy of the working class, the great enemy of the people, the great enemy of the nation and an expression of Party impurity. Big enemy present, we have the need to hit him. Only when subjectivity is defeated, Marxism Leninist ideology will rise up, party nature will be consolidated, and the revolution meets victorious.' \\nCriticism could not continue, and in order to criticize Bao zhejun Che-jun, they set him two articles: 'First, Bao zhejun Che-jun is not allowed to quote the words above the Mao Zedong Collection to refute his critical opinion; second, only Bau Che-jun is allowed to record his critical opinion honestly.' After that criticism, some comrades were not alienating him, but rather approached him. A small comrade named Zhou Gonggan said to him at the basketball court at the Public Security Department: 'Comrade Bao zhejun, you stick to the truth, I support you!' He was finished with tears. \\nThe next day there was a large print newspaper entitled 'Against the repression of democracy' in favor of Bao zhejun Che-jun. In total, more than 50 people from the Public Security Department have 24 signatures in the large print. In order to dispel his influence, an emergency party branch assembly was immediately convened, at which he called for a clear line with him. On the third day, a large print appeared 'Unveiling the Leather of the Right Party Party'. Comrade Li Hui, who graduated from the Faculty of Law of Chuan University, considered Li as his brother. Li had four children, and the expenses were big. At that time everyone was low wages. Single Che-jun was a bachelor. He was a little better than him. He was in class fraternity, sometimes funded a little expense. The big print actually criticized this behavior as 'using money to cage people, centrifuge from the party'. It is only then for the 25-year-old person to truly experience the meaning of the crime of 'no need'. \\nLater, after dozens of criticisms and struggles by dozens, hundreds and even thousands of people, he was finally officially classified as a right-wing. At that time, the right-wing was divided into four levels: extreme right, general right, middle right, far-right. He belongs to the right of the general right, given four 'counts'; the first, opposes the socialist system and reversals the case for four people, including the counter-revolutionist Li Tianguang; second, attacking the social town of 1955, saying that the social town of 1955 has consciously widened the policy boundaries; and article 3, attacks internal rebellion, says internal rebellion, said that the interior of 1955 It is that there is no popular opinion; Article 4, attacking the Party's cadre policy, saying that the Communist Party's promotion cadres have touted Phenomena. He was also called 'deputy handsome of the anti-party groups' of the Public Security Department. \\nThis 'anti-party group' has the so-called five members, all party members, all deputy section chiefs. One of them is also comrade Li Xueji, who joined the army in 1937 and made numerous battles. Unfortunately, comrades learned poetry unfortunately died on the farm, not able to boil up to today. \\nAfter Bao zhejun Che-jun was classified as the right, although he was not in mind, he insisted on his work, accepted the congresses and destroyed during the day, and in the evening, he had to give people a political class. As a result of bad work, he later offered to hand over a pistol and gave up his job to help the Correctional Labour Section to examine cases of increased commutation of sentence. \\nhard labor\\nAt this time, each other is also. On February 13, 1958, Bao zhejun Che-jun went to Wolong Valley Farm together with the Honghe State authorities classified as 'right' comrades and began a supervised transformation life. \\nIn the age of 'Great Leap Forward and Big Steelmaking', they had to work ten hours a day. Work at six o'clock in the morning, at 11 o'clock for lunch, work at 1:00 in the afternoon, five o'clock work, after dinner and 'compulsory labor' to eight o'clock, and then still have to peanut peanuts to sleep, sometimes even until 1:00 in the morning to rest. Later we invented the use of bamboo clips to improve efficiency. Peanuts are not allowed to eat, there is a rate of rice stuck, eat is battered, also not allowed to peel the red skin, because it is seed, red skin will not sprout. Some people figure fast, first step on the shell and then peel, the red skin also stepped on, was identified as destroying production was criticized. Some of the people who went to the city, had not planted sweet potatoes, planted the sweet potato vine, and were also believed to have been battered to destroy production. The labor intensity on the farm, long working hours plus 36 food per month, infirm or sick, had to go to see Marx in advance. \\nIn four years on the farm, he felt too criticized. He is a model for the public security organs. How can the Chinese farmers become not only the bourgeois overnight, but also the right of the bourgeois, how did he change from quantity to qualitative change? He can't answer. What is wrong with the proposal made in response to the call of Chairman Mao of the Party Central Committee, according to Chairman Mao's 'Question of Correct Contradictions within the People'? However, he also thought that he was the son of the working people. The Communist Party had grace to him, and that he had been educated by the Party for so many years and was wronged, believing that one day it would be clarified. Therefore, he was ready to go to the farm: he sent home 400 yuan of public bonds, plus 25 yuan only precious property, and the last salary of 78 yuan; wrote a letter to his family that he would not have the money to send home to work on the farm later. In order not to make parents sad, they are not told what they are classified as the right. His books, except for three volumes of the Collection of Mao Zedong, were lost. In addition, he went to Mengzi's 'bridge rice noodles' in the birthplace of Yunnan rice noodles in seven years, so he and Comrade Puxingyuan, a member of the 'opposition group' farewell, met to eat a 5-corner bowl of 'bridge rice noodles' and packed his luggage together to the farm. \\nBao zhejun Zhejun once he went to the farm to work deadly, to strive for the initiative. At Wolong Valley Farm, he was first engaged in infrastructure to hit the adobe, he was responsible for picking the sludge and others hit the adobe. His pick of thin mud can hit 14 adobe, each pick has more than 100 kg, because it is a short distance pick, are picked with the right shoulder, 3 months later, right rib oppressor right lungs, in unloading the burden right chest pain (under lack)\\nHe was one of them. Indeed, it was not easy. It was his death and labor, and he came back to the people. However, in 1960, he was considered unstable at Dongfeng Farm because he bought a tank of orange sauce for a member of the 'anti-party group' of the Public Security Department, Puxingyuan. In addition to cancelling his statistics work, he was criticized for another week. It was really 'to add sin, what is wrong?' \\nSince he picked his hat, he was arranged as a team leader, holding more than 30 people, including two decentralized cadres. On the surface, he was a team leader. In the minds of the cadres, he was nothing more than a 'hat-picking right'. In 1960, farmers from nearby villages were incorporated into rural areas as agricultural workers. More than 10 farmers from a Hmong village formed a group, the vast majority of whom were women. The leaders thought he was tempered and called him to be the leader of the Hmong group. He only led them to work, all of whom had families with children. Phillips and where they are better. \\nLater, a farm leader and a beautiful Miao girl talked about love, a bit of breaking behavior. The people of the Miao group thought it was bullying them, reluctant to be on the farm and asked to move home to live. The farm leaders thought it was a political issue, and when they went to consult them, they did not speak, saying some other reasons. \\nAs a result, after some generalization, the farm leader went on the line, gave him this team leader four counts, was criticized for a week. He had to fight another group as the leader, had to fight at night, and had to wait for time during the day, because they were also required to be used by the labor force. The four counts are: one, not to respect the customs of ethnic minorities; second, not paying attention to the security of minorities; thirdly, not allowing minorities to speak the national language; and four, not to allow minorities to wear national clothing. A leading cadre who presided over the critique said: 'I just said that the right can't be used as cadres. Now it certainly proves that the right will not be a cadre. The Miao group does not move, if you move the house without subcontracting Che-jun!' Bao zhejun Che-jun defended four counts at the fighting meeting: First, on the issue of disrespect for the customs of ethnic minorities, several people from the Miao group offered leave to return to their original villages for the death of more people, and went to the party committee secretary Ma Dinggui (formerly the State Attorney General). He said: 'Not allowed to go, tell them that they are workers now. People class, not farmers of the past, can no longer superstition'. He came back to convey the original words, but they went overnight and came back overnight. Work as usual on the next day. Second, with regard to the lack of attention to the security of ethnic minorities, there is a period of time overtime, that is, overtime work after dinner until midnight. Once again, a Hmong girl almost fell into a dead well in the field (at that time there were many wells that would not get out of water). In fear of accidents, he suggested to party committee secretary Ma Dinggui: 'Most of the Miao group are elderly people, women and children. Overnight shifts are difficult to walk, prone to danger, not overnight work.' Secretary Ma agreed that since then the Miao group enjoyed special care and did not add night shifts. 3. On the issue of not allowing ethnic minorities to speak ethnic languages, two female staff members of the nursery group do not understand the Miao language spoken by the Miao children. They have said to the Miao children: 'Little sister, we do not understand what you say, and then you also speak our words (Chinese)'. Fourth, on the issue of not allowing ethnic minorities to wear ethnic clothing, again, captain Fan Mu met a minority girl named Luo embroidered, joked: 'Xiao Luo, wear your mother's clothes too troublesome, but also need to embroider so many flowers, you see, wear our clothes are convenient, save embroidery.' \\nAfter he said, there was nothing to criticize, and none of the Hmong group gave an opinion. However, the Han cadres who participated in the fight against him were still unwilling to buy things for Luo's children, and wanted to have a relationship with Luo (husband died). Originally he wanted to say, 'I have citizenship, I have no wife, she has no husband, that is, it is legal to fall in love'. But Luo immediately stood up and said, 'We can not unequivocally wronged people, people don't mean this at all.' He was not justifying it. At that time, his thinking was very contradictory, believing that the farm did not see the 'right' as a person. He was sympathetic, and only bought something for Luo's child. She was a person from the group of Bao zhejun Zechun, and should be concerned about her. Even such things are to be criticized. How can people think about it? Is it not the same as this matter when it comes to thinking of the pre-rightist criticism of 'using money to reach people, centrifuge from the party'? He thinks, 'How is this guy stupid? Money will not spend it on their own. Why do you want to buy a crime on their own. Alas! It's really good to be done! Is this my mind twist, or is the mind of those 'activists' twisted?' He hasn't figured out for a long time. \\nAfter seven days, the Miao group who was originally the production captain should look at enough lively by people, he said the fair saying: 'Do not always take old bags to criticize, we have to move it has nothing to do with him. Mainly outside this girl, listening to our words before not having a relationship with the leader, and not listening to our words since having a relationship with the leader. Now, people are married. What else do we say? You advise, we will move, you do not advise, we will move too!' The leaders who presided over the colloquium were not prepared for this sudden situation and seemed very embarrassed. They had to announce the adjournment of the meeting, and then the vast majority of the Hmong group moved back to their original village. The farm also did not give Bauzhejun any punishment. But he was discouraged, and after the party committee secretary Ma Dinggui came back, he went directly to ask, 'Secretary Ma, don't I still have to be punished. Why is it still not to be punished?' Secretary Ma said: 'The packet, this thing has nothing to do with you, is the problem of □ □ □ □. He is a preparatory party member, we have extended his preparation period. This thing is all right! You do not carry the burden of thought.' He was wrongfully battered for seven nights, and there was no place to seek legal protection, and to get the comfort of a party committee secretary, had to be treated in such a way. \\nWater wells\\nBao zhejun Zhejun in the farm miss, led the group is a mobile 'field force', where tired, where hardship, sent them to the group. The dam leaks, organized some people to dive down to race loopholes, repair reservoirs, steel making, go to the train station when handling workers earn money, dig coal, water wells also have them... The wells they played in the production team at Dongfeng Farm Xiaoping Land have been used until today. \\nOriginally, it was another group to dig well. When singles reached two or three meters deep, I wonder why they changed to their group to play ah. He and another person were digging mud in the underground, others in the top of the mud, poured mud, and so on to hit 10 meters deep met the sand, and the water came out of the water, only saw the groundwater rushed above, the earth above the surrounding dust to the middle cross, how the two people were busy also unable to move the crumbled sand, he had no experience, afraid of the whole Well landslides are buried alive. In danger of his life, he was in a hurry and said to another member, 'You go up and die for me!' Then the man went up, he alone in the bottom of the hole was even more unfinished, and the master of the well head above asked what happened. After understanding the situation, the master was happy to say, 'Do not worry, you have successfully dig well! Sandy soil can't be finished. I put down four live wood, you put it into a tic-tac tac, and then you come up and I come down to the bricks.' \\nIn danger of his life, Bao zhejun Zhejun heard that the well was successful, there was unspeakable pleasure, as if he had completed a great cause. Master bricks straight up, there is still a gap, the brick poured some charcoal, charcoal fill, a few days later, a new well suc"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "cessfully, well delivered to use, this well water tastes sweet, there are their sweat and hardships. It is indeed a devotion to the 'right', where there are just over a dozen dollars a month. But the whole Dongfeng farm turned out to be a wasteland, through them these people split up the fields, making it a grain barn, this well compared to the whole farm, how small it is! \\nBuy 'Mao Selection'\\nWhen he announced that he went to the Maitrek Dongfeng Farm, almost all his books were lost. Only volumes one, two or three of the Collection of Mao Zedong were not lost. The fourth volume of the Collection of Mao Zedong was published in 1960. Although in the position of being dictatorship, it was still yearning for the Party, the admirer Chairman Mao, eager to see the book. However, Xinhua bookstores do not buy them. They have even been disqualified to study Chairman Mao's writings. What should I do? \\nHis classmate Zhang Zhengen studied at the Moscow Gold Academy in the Soviet Union, and he wanted to sell something abroad, he wrote. The letter replied that the book was not sold there and was not released. His classmate Liu Kangzhu was at a cannon school in Nanjing, where he bought it, but did not buy it in Nanjing or Beijing. Bao zhejun Zhejun also worked for the old comrades in the Mengzi Xinhua Bookstore. The final hope was placed on him. Unfortunately, he replied that this was a planned release. \\nThe way to buy a book in the front and back doors are blocked, but Bao zhejun Che-jun still holds great hopes. He dreamed that one day books would buy hands. \\nCertainly, old student Zhang Zhengen returned from the Soviet Union to study abroad. He has not forgotten that Bao zhejun Che-jun asked him to choose four volumes. When he traveled to Chengdu, he bought a copy sent to the farm, wrote on the title page of the book: 'Give a small bag to a young friend who is suffering.' \\nOn the night of receiving the book, he was under the kerosene lamp, and he finished reading four volumes overnight. In particular, President Mao Zedong's instructions on the three major battles in the liberation war have led him to admire the five bodies. He saved it like a treasure, sometimes taken out in a look. It is more difficult for him to buy 'Mao Selection' in the novel 'Song of the Sea of Ouyang Sea'. \\nThere is marriage\\nWhen Bao zhejun Che-jun was classified as a 'right', he was not married, even the object of love. 1959 was the culmination of 'right-wing' divorce. Some young wives, in the name of visiting their husbands, handed their children on the farm to their husbands, and then draw the boundaries with their husbands-divorce! The courts at that time generally approved such divorce cases! Keling's 'right' father and son two, share 18 yuan a month's salary, talk to spend the day! He is a lucky man compared to these divorced elders. \\nHe was 'right' not even tired of others, less one thought pain. In four years on the farm, some comrades advised him to find a rural girl as a wife, and he did not go. This is not to look down on the rural girls. Honestly, in those years, the stomach is not enough, the labor intensity, long hours of work, heavy mental pressure, and simply reluctance to think about marriage. By the end of 1961, Comrade Yang Qun of Fate introduced him to his fate Comrade Jin Yunxia, who were team leaders of the same team and understood each other. He felt that Jin Yunxia was able and beautiful, and had a good impression of her, agreed immediately, but was afraid she disagreed. \\nAmong some boyfriends he met, Jin Yunxia felt that the packet was originally engaged in the work of public security. It was politically reliable and had feelings for the party and expressed his willingness to consider. \\nShe gave Bao zhejun Zhejun the first impression was in Dongfeng farm Huangjiazhuang work area at a night party, she and Yang Qunhe jumped a dance, both were wearing a light green sweater, dance beautiful looks very elegant. She was the group leader of the vegetable group, and it was all on them to eat on the farm. \\nI heard that she came from Kunming to Shanghai West to fight guerrilla from Kunming. She joined the party in 1950 and has been the secretary of Huxi County League Committee. More lively and able to work, often appointed by the county to key townships as the head of the working group. In 1957, when the 'Great Leap Forward' in 1958, Huxi County could not jump up. It was believed that the 'right' was doing destruction and engaged in a 'anti-right fill lesson'. He has no right-wing speech, he's not well drawn, what to do? Just turn her historical account. In 1956, Jin Yunxia attended the first party congress in Huxi County as an organ party representative. She disagreed with a comrade to serve as a county committee committee member, that is, was identified as an opposition party, is a 'right-wing element' in Yunnan's 'Zheng Wang opposition group' reaching out to Huxi County. That's why she was sent to Dongfeng Farm to supervise production. \\nShe lives as a group leader in vegetables, and as a girl, she can take the lead, especially she takes the lead in picking big buckets, allowing men to admire. During the busy season of planting and harvesting farmers, they raided to work in the field, and the work of their group was also engaged in. Bao zhejun Che-jun worked on statistics in Huangjiazhuang, and had some knowledge of them. \\nIn January 1962, the person who took off the right hat had her bag, they focused on learning, ready to be assigned back to the organ to work, everyone was happy for a while. \\nOne night during the study, they first met the road walk in the zone, it was acquaintances, if talking about labor, but also generous, a talk of love, each other's feelings are somewhat nervous. After a while, finally opened the deadlock, poured out love with each other, and made a preliminary statement. There was no modern move at that time. By February, the above policy changed. Only cadres who originally belonged to the Zhengxian department level or above, cadres below the district section are assigned individual personnel. She is one of the individuals. In mid-February she returned to work in the Agricultural and Water Section of Huxi County People's Government. Bao zhejun Zhejun is still working on the farm. They were in love on paper, and love letters were made one after another. \\n'The same is the end of the fall, why should we have met with acquaintance'. She, just at the foot of Mt. Gui, is only a few tens of kilometers apart, that is, can't be seen. This mountain is more than 2,500 meters above sea level and is the base of the revolutionary base of the Yunnan people. The guerrilla captain of Comrade Zhujiabi is active here. When the mountain is covered by clouds, the heaven will rain, it became the Meteorological Station in the two counties of Maitreh and Huxi, it also made Bao zhejun Che-jun to miss the distant intellectuals. Their love resembles the rocks on the Guishan, endure the wind and rain blows. \\nIn Huxi, there are some 'good intentions' comrades who advised her to cut off with Bao zhejun Che-jun. The reason is that it is not possible to transfer him to West China for work. But she was very firm and replied, 'I can't count, he is his worker, I am my cadre, what can't be?' \\nI did not expect that in early July 1962, according to the agreed time, Bao zhejun Zhejun from the farm returned to Huxi to marry. Farmers' friends Shen Heting, Jiang Yuyun and other comrades bought a mattress sheet to them. He led the savings of more than 100 yuan to Shanghai and West. Some old comrades in West China have heard that they want to get married, have difficulty with their money, take the initiative to help. Comrades such as Wang Wenkui and Zhao Yuxing handed over passbooks to Jin Yunxia, but they did not spend, they did not buy furniture, did not buy clothes, did not have a drink table, and only bought some candy and asked the old comrades to be lively. On July 8, married this evening, old comrades came to Teddo, candy bought again and again. Because Comrade Jin Yunxia was in West China at that time, young, beautiful and courageous work, pursuing her cadres a lot, she did not promise. The old comrades wanted to see what kind of husband she picked up. Some old comrades even said this in the presence of Choshi. There is also a reason why old comrades come more, that is, Li Fawen, County Governor of Huxi County, personally certifies them, and vice governor Yin Guangwei hosted the wedding. This is still a matter of desertion in West China. Comrade Li Fawen, the former deputy director of the Public Security Department of Honghe Prefecture. When Bao zhejun Zhejun went to the Public Security Department in 1951, Li was a child. Li was the deputy secretary section chief. They had been along for many years and understood each other. When Li went to Huxi, he said to him, 'You have problems, say you have no problem, you also do. There are no problems, for the past, do not mention, good work in the future is!' In the minds of the county chief, he is not an 'enemy.' Li was happy to marry their main marriage until late at night. \\nIn those years of criticism when greeting them, a prefecture governor, who married two 'hat-picking right-wing' men, was indeed prepared to take the risk. Anyway, the county governor is a rare good man! Bao zhejun Che-jun's two men were very grateful in the heart, but could not give his gratitude to him. \\nWhen the butcher\\nBao zhejun Che-jun returned to the farm after her marriage. Then wrote about his marriage and told Comrade Xu Yanzhen, the former chief of the Public Security Department. \\nThis enthusiastic old chief is the old Red Army who joined the army in 1936. Yuan is the head of the defense section of 38 division. In 1950, he also served as the head of the Public Security Department of the Mongolian since 1950. He has very strict requirements for the work of the subordinate, but he loves the subordinate. At this time, he was deputy secretary and secretary general of the State Committee. He and Dongfeng Farm Party Committee Secretary Ma Dinggui and Huxi County Committee Secretary Shi Kejian unified the idea, he assigned Bao zhejun Zhejun to the food company in Huxi County. It was set to administrative level 26, with a monthly salary of 30 yuan. Compared to the farm, it was into heaven. Dividing his work, for the vast 'right' of the farm, is only looking for Mei quenching thirst. \\nOn August 24, 1962, Bao zhejun Zhejun said goodbye to punishment, exercise their own Dongfeng farm came to West West, began 17 years of pig butcher life. \\nInitially was divided to kill pig farm, that is a hand kill pig factory, the original posts are enough people, just help, open the transfer order, who help who helps, it seems that this is due to people, there is no lot of him. He was originally engaged in public security work, and he didn't understand anything about commercial work, not even weighing scales. But she was not a person who had a casual meal, and always wanted to find something to do. He learned to scale, plan plate, learn to kill pig, turn the intestine and so on. Killing a pig or old master Lu Taian put his hand into the pig's neck, mainly a question of guts. Bold, once learned, but turn the pig intestine is not easy, dirty smelly is not terrible, will be used to it for a long time, afraid to accidentally break the intestine, get everywhere when urine is difficult to wash off. It is the master who turns the intestine, this living plan has learned, other processes are not difficult. Lead winter, kill pig plant to process ham, bacon (under the lack)\\nadversity knowledge\\nOn the day of April 1970, a family from an old delegation to Xiangyang commune spoon brigade Aikan village, passing through Xiangyang, there are eight nine horses carrying things, most of which are books, we feel rare, go to see the lively, Bao zhejun Che-jun also went to see, he guess that one of the family must be a big intellectuals. \\nLater, the family's eldest daughter was transferred to the commune as an announcer for the cable radio station. One day she came to Bao zhejun Chechun's lover's medicine department to buy medicine, pull up the family routine, according to her introduction:\\nHer name is Rao Yunzi, a Cantonese. His father is Rao Hua. He joined the Communist Party of China in 1935. He was the former director of the Political Department of the Guibian District of Yunnan Province, and after liberation he served as Minister of Propaganda Department of Yunnan Provincial Committee. Her mother is Cui Ming, who joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1946 as a heroine and worked around Ho Chi Minh. In 1958, Yuso's parents were beaten as 'right-wing' and 'key elements of the Arun opposition group.' Her parents have long refused to admit that they were the right, and the 'Cultural Revolution' neutrals criticized and warned her dad: 'Do not hold old qualifications, you are no longer a member of the Communist Party, you have been expelled from the party!' Her father replied, 'You fired me, I did not fire myself!' Her dad was such a hard bone, but worked diligently and diligently. In nominal terms, her father was the deputy director of the workshop. In fact, even the deputy director of the workshop was not relieved to let him do it. He was only asked to keep a few acres of the processing plant's production base. Although he was suffering from asthma, he still insisted on climbing up the mountain every day to guard the bag valley. Workers kindly joke with him: 'The old revolution, this point we take you, you don't have to climb this slope every day! No one dare to steal the valley!' But he said, my monthly salary in the collar factory does not give some work in the factory. I'm sorry for the factory, and I'm sorry for the workers! Workers are helpless to watch this loyal old revolution every day climb to the slopes and guard the valley against the scorching sun. Because he (she), did not confess guilt, the villains sent the mother of the brace to the countryside for rehabilitation, and devolved the brace and her younger brother and sister who had just gone to junior high school to the countryside to receive education from poor peasants. So they came to Aican, the highest colder village on the South Pan River, and became farmers. \\nWith the increase in contact, she became friends with Bao zhejun Che-jun family. Later, an old villain said to the commune: 'Her mother and dad are the big right, she can't be an announcer! The commune leader was afraid to wear the hat of 're-using the right children', and decided categorically not to let her be an announcer and called her to the Shama Brigade as a private teacher. Although she taught well, she couldn't turn right, and she went home on Sunday to return to Bao zhejun Che-jun's house. They saw her in front of her niece, and the children of his family called her 'big sister.' On one occasion, she was going to return to the real home of Aichan, and it was raining for days, 40 Huali mountain paths, and there were no villages on the road, and she was afraid to go back alone. At her house, her mother received him warmly and cooked ham for her, but because of natural disasters, there was no rice, but only thick noodles and taro like chopsticks. Originally, he was a rural man, he could eat any diet, that day for no reason, how could not eat noodles. They had to eat some taro. They felt guilty, and Bao zhejun Che-jun also felt sad. It was a lot of emotion: her mother, a county cadre, was sent to rural areas as alternate members, and four of the mother and child were tired all year round, and still suffered not enough basic rations, and also increased the burden on the production team. Bao zhejun Zhejun saw her cooking, his body lying on the ground, eyes with tears, I do not know whether it was smoked by the flame or sad to get out. Is this the heroine who was praised in the guerrilla area? Is this the internationalist fighter fighting around Ho Chi Minh? What sin do their mothers and children have? Why are deported and decentralized? What is this good for the country? Bao zhejun Che-jun recalls:\\nIn the next five years, the men of her family came and went to my house, and I found them in a van. For these reasons, the mother of Yizo is afraid to affect us politically, and I said, 'We have been struck into the bottom of society, and what else does not affect.' In 1974, the mother and younger siblings of the Brass were old, and the rest of the Rue was still a private teacher in the Shama brigade, and our home was truly the home of the Yizo. In 1975, she was enrolled in a cultural study by comrades as 'children who can be educated', and she was prepared to take the exam with confidence, but, one afternoon before the admissions, the head of the admissions office informed her: 'You don't go to the cultural expedition.' Yushi asked: why? The person in charge replied: 'Very simple, your mom and dad are the famous big right in the province!' A pot of cold water poured from the head to the foot, the rustan humiliated, angry, disappointed... she crying back to my house, wrote to tell her mother and dad, and her mom criticized her: no ambition! What sin did your mom and dad have? Who asks you to admit that you are a good child to educate? She cried again. We convince her not to be discouraged and find another way out. Soon, pulling the white coal mine to recruit coal workers, to recruit people from urban accounts, we advised her to go to apply for the examination, save to live here being discriminated against. At that time, there were few people who had gone to the coal mine, and she also took it Her parents were far from old, and I took her to a formal job from the old Dongshan in Huxi, instead of her parents. As she walked, she was still relentless, with the people of the alpine mountainous regions that had not yet been solved. \\nAfter going to the mine, she was initially assigned to coke, the raw coal into coke. She was weak, she was not moving the coal, crying several times over her nose, and after a while, she finally adapted. Just adapt, the mine again transferred her to mine primary school to teach, this time she was a veritable public teacher. \\nBao zhejun Zhejun said: 'Because we and Yizu have become friends, we and Comrades Rao Hua and Cui Ming have also become friends, and have contacts and know ourselves in misery. Without this misery, maybe I could not meet such an official. Once again, when I came to Comrade Rao Hua's home, talking about that many censorship at Yizhi University, I asked Comrade Rao Hua: Do you participate in the underground party review that year? He said, 'Of course, to review, this is very simple, and the party introducers know best. But the harshest censorship is still the KMT's slaughter, and only if he is not afraid of death, can this pass! '' He said four so easily, reminds me of the words of a martyr: 'Beheaded does not matter, as long as the doctrine is true!' Dying under the slaughter of the enemy, there is no regret, but by their own people wronged, and up to 20 years, no belief is difficult to adhere to! It is then that I understand why they don't admit themselves to being the right. \\nIn February 1979, Yizi's dad and mother settled. His father, Comrade Rao Ping, was the director of the Yunnan Academy of Social Sciences, and her mother Cui Ming served as the director of the political office of the institute. At this time, Bau Che-jun has transferred to the state procurator Once again, Comrade Cui Ming, the mother of Yizo at the Yizo family, told him: 'Uncle Bao zhejun, you and me, these people were pundled, in addition to unloading the burden to us and our children, they also removed the burden of intellectuals and restored the party's prestige among the intellectuals. One of our factory's chief engineer named Wang, after I and Yizu's father broke down, came to my house to congratulate him. He said to Yizu's dad, 'Director Rao, this is good, you are all right, we are liberated!' Yizu's dad did not understand what he said, and asked, 'Wang, how do you say that? The king always said, 'The right hat is wearing only on your heads, but weighs heavily on our hearts. Those of you, who took part in the revolution in the early years, were born to death for decades, and in the end, fell to a 'right' hat. We, intellectuals from old society, will they be wearing a hat, can they still have a chance to make a difference at work? You pacify, demonstrating that the Communist Party has truly restored its ideological line of truth and respect for knowledge and talent! We are really liberated! The country has hope! ' Uncle, you see how relevant this old engineer, outside the party said! What a touching heart!' Bao zhejun Che-jun replied, 'Yeah, I often think that our cadres of 'million gold oil' delay for 21 years, seem to have little loss to the country, but those big scientists and big intellectuals, they just don't have a burden on the right, they don't create inventions, we can't pull out the knowledge in their minds. The loss is invisible and huge. We've lost over 20 years, I think it's mainly at this point.' Comrade Cui Ming nodded and said, 'Hop! No production, technology does not go, the country of course has to be backward Hello!' \\nSoon, Yizu also transferred a unit to work in Kunming. She completed her free time in the Chinese Department of Yunnan University, obtained a college diploma, and then taught at the Zhuhai Municipal Public Security College, she achieved the teaching and research results of Chinese medicine in her work. Her younger brother and sister also earned a college diploma in self-study. They made up for the shortcomings of the 'congenital' with their efforts acquired, and they were all children of scrambling. Perhaps adversity is the driving force of their minds. \\nA funny story\\nI heard that in ancient times, some rebelliers declared themselves emperor, marshal, general. After the 'liberation', some anti-revolutionary elements also claimed to be commander-in-chief, commander in chief, etc., they did not hear of people claiming to be liu kou, thieves, and counter-revolutionary. But in the late 1950s, people in the 'anti-right' struggle claimed to be 'right-wing,' which was not a false statement but a true truth. Because right-wing indicators were not completed, individual good leaders volunteered to reach the figures. \\nThe thing is like this:\\nIn 1958, Huxi County people's Government assigned to a agricultural school graduate, named Qin Xingmin, Kunming city, only 19 years old. At that time, it was at the time of the Great Leap Forward in Shanghai and West. It was said that the right was engaged in sabotage and turned into a 'anti-right fill lesson' movement, and another nine 'leaking the net right' were all said to be the minions of the 'Zheng Wang opposition group' reaching out to the West West. All over the province are engaged in political movements, and the county government is also unable to arrange the professional work of this newly arrived secondary school student. He will arrange him to go to a rural village to guide and supervise the work of nine 'leaking the net right'. This is also a political task! \\nThis child who has just entered society, in front of this group of 'old guys' (said older than 20 and 30 years old), is not said to be guiding supervision, actually working together and living together, only playing a leading role. Three months have passed, the county committee winds office felt bad management and decided to send nine 'right' to Dongfeng farm. The office opened an introduction letter to send 10 'right-wing', asking Qin Xingmin to send nine right to Dongfeng Farm. To the farm, the receiving people read the introduction letter, the number of people, just 10 people, together, all have luggage, on the formation group, each also sent a 'registration form' for everyone to fill in. The nine 'right-wing' thought that Qin Xingmin was a cadre who had delegated labor and exercise, and had not done questioning cadres. Each person buried the table. As for Qin Xingmin himself inexplicably filled out the form with everyone, he did not realize the seriousness of the problem. The day to the nature (refers to fill in place, rich, anti, bad, right), a column, I don't know how to fill in. He went to see how a few old guys filled. 'Ah! The original court president, organization minister, secretary of the regiment... are all right, then I-I'm afraid it is also the right.' He thought that way, and he filled it like that. Then the collection table was sent up. Bao zhejun Zhejun's lover is also one of nine people. She kindly asked Qin Xingmin: 'Xiao Qin, the nature of that column how do you fill in?' \\n'You all fill the right, can I still not fill the right?!' \\n'We fill in the right because it was classified as the right, it was approved by the organization and declared by the General Assembly. Which unit are you going to the right? Where was it announced? How are you so confused? The right is the enemy, the object of dictatorship, but not good!' Xiao Qin only then understood the concept and weight of the right, and began to hurry, he asked:\\n'So what do you do?' \\n'What to do?! Don't go to the Political Office to change the miles!' \\nThis 'three-door' cadre who went out of his house and entered the door of the institution, had not yet seen the world without rain and rain. The next day, he came to the door of the Farm Political Office with a tremor and crept, and one cadre asked in vandness:\\n'What are you doing?' \\n'Yesterday my entry registration form was misplaced, I'll change it'. \\n'What is the wrong place?' \\n'The nature of that column was filled in the wrong way, I'm not the right party...', in the end, if the sound is small, or did not say at all, which cadre out of professional habits, he said loudly:\\n'Um! You still want to turn the case?!' \\nKeling's Xiao Qin, there is no longer lines to back, a whole mess in his mind, back in frustration, and without saying that the other 'right-wing' of course did not dare to ask, nor are they qualified to ask, so they have to endure, they have always been labor, under supervision, but still suffered a lot of criticism and beaten \\nTime, for life, said slow, 21 years of bitterness, day as difficult; said fast, 21 years fleeting, Xiao Qin became old Qin, is already 40 years old, but a widower stick. The Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a gospel to the 'right' on the farm. The Central Committee decided to reinstate the ideological line of truth, reverse all wrong cases, and correct the wrong right. At the beginning of 1979, the names of people who had been mistaken right from the right came back to their original unit or arranged another job. Qin Xingmin was happy with everyone for a while, but immediately became pessimistic. This 'small right' Huxi County, who drew himself with a water pen, did not recognize. The cadres of the County Committee's United Front Work Department replied: 'We do not have any unit in Huxi County crossed your right, and we are not responsible for arranging your work.' \\nHaving been confused as the right for 21 years, there is a young young man who has become a half-old man, and no one admits, who is this fault? Is it an organization? Is it personal? Or the rule? How are the rights of citizens protected? Oh my God! Who goes to tell this wrong!? \\nXiao Qin returned to Kunming's home in a mood of sorrow and went to visit the old mother who was not seen for 21 years. When entering the house, the mother is not there, there is only a big girl who has no acquaintance. Xiao Qin did not introduce himself, just said to find a certain (fuck name). The girl saw his dilapidated clothes, afraid he would steal something from her house, took a small stool and put him outside the door and said: 'You wait, I'll find you.' Then the girl locked the door out. After a while, the girl came back with Xiao Qin's mother. Mother and child meet, crying with pain, then the girl standing aside realized that he was not reassured that the dressed person she had not met her brother, but also cry together, a family of three crying side by saying this 21 years of parting bitterness. Xiao Qin told two days at home for two days. Finally it was agreed that the West would still find a way. \\nReturning to Shanghai-Xi, the United Front Front Department and the Organization Department are still not responsible for arranging Qin Xingmin's work. The reason is that: 'Huxi has not crossed your right.' He disagrees, he wants to complain! But a secondary school student did not know how to write a complaint. It's no wonder that the teacher in the school didn't think of what might happen later, and did not give him a lesson on how to appeal. He asked Su Qi, an old cadre of the department store, to help him write. Comrade Su Qi listened to Qin Xingmin's talk, moved, tears! She even doubted that she was listening to fairy tales. However, in front of the Xiao Qin is a living and real person. She sympathizes with him and believes: 'Under the leadership of the Communist Party, it would be too unfair to have something like this!' She not only helped Xiaoqin write complaints, but also traveled everywhere for him, looking for county committees and county governments to justify. \\nThe reason for this kind person is: 'No matter whoever's fault, Qin Xingmin is a cadre of the county government. The county government has not fired him. Why did he ask where this person went for so many years? Governments should have an unshirkable responsibility. Now that people are back, why not admit, no division of labor?' \\nFor a time, Qin Xingmin's incident was spread throughout the city of Huxi County, and the people all talked about it. All believed that Qin Xingmin was too wrong. In fact, why is Qin Xingmin alone? \\nFinally, the United Front War Department and the Organization Department agreed to division of labor, let him engage in the old bank and go to the agricultural technical station. After 21 years, Qin Xingmin has finally been professional counterpart. \\nO people! When you read this 'mythical' story, I don't know how to feel? \\nIn this matter, are our organs up and down a legal concept? The herdsmen have a sheep to look everywhere, and an organ is missing a cadre, and no one has ever asked for 21 years. Actually, there is still a word to cheer up there. Can this be called 'Extremely responsible for the people?' \\nGood people hope that such 'myths' will not be reproduced! \\nBack to political and law organs\\nThe light is like arrows, the sun and moon. The precious 21 years of human life, a blink of an eye has passed. From December 1967 t"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "o January 1979, Bao zhejun Che-jun complained about the absence of a message for 12 years. In February 1979, he was suddenly informed and 'anti-party leader' Sun Bao zhejunzhong went to the State Public Security Department to see the 'correction conclusions'. Bao zhejun Zechun said: 'This is the credit of the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee! The joy and excitement of our heart cannot be described.' \\nSun Bao zhejunzhong announced that he graduated from the Central Public Security School. May 1951 assigned to the Mengzi Public Security Department. Bao zhejun Che-jun was assigned to the Public Security Service on December 23, 1951, and they fell to work in the town counter office. In 1957 they were all fought as members of the 'anti-party group'. Sun Bao zhejunzhong was the coach, and Bao zhejun Zhejun was deputy handsome. In 1962 package was distributed to Huxi County food company, in 1963 Sun and distribution to Huxi County supply and marketing company, 1964 they were merged into the food company, it was really interesting, every time the package went to the company reconciliation, to Sun Bao zhejunzhong there to eat and live. \\nAfter receiving comrades back to the office, Bao zhejun Zhejun went to Sun Bao zhejun-zhongjia to discuss with his couple the night on what to do in the future. Sun's opinion mentioned that a small business was doing business. Sun's beloved Shao Cuixin's opinion is that, since the pacification, it means that you have no problems and should return to the political and legal organs to work. Bao zhejun Zechun agreed with Sun's lover Xiao Shao's opinion, and said: 'We are eligible to return to work in the political and law organs, and there are many old comrades, old and lower ranks, there are difficulties in coordinating their work; secondly, returning to work is good for the education of our children.' Bao zhejun Zhong said: 'Work hard for political and legal work! You want to live less for years?' 'Well, of course, it seems that our generation is destined to suffer.' They united their minds and demanded that they return to work on the political and legal front. At the door of the state government, he met the former Director of Public Security, comrade Li Zongkong, deputy secretary of the state committee in charge of political law. He was very passionate about 20 years, and he was happy to tell them: 'Your problems have been settled, inform the whole state, the documents I have issued.' They shake hands with Deputy Secretary Li and say hello. He is already nearly 60 years old, and looks like it is still as rich and youthful. \\nComrade Li Kongzong is the enlightenment teacher of package, he is 12 years older than the bag, family origin is poor farmers, the level of culture is not high, is the old eight road joined the army in 1938, after the enemy martial team, self-study culture, write a good word. He has been working for a long time in public security and has extensive practical experience. He has a strong, logical speech, very vivid and convincing. During his tenure as Chief of Public Security, Bao zhejun Che-jun favoured listening to him and making reports. In the Public Security Department, both her home and her private family are difficult. The Public Security Department pays hardship allowance every year, that is, only two of their families. The bag was promoted by him, and later in his hands in the bag, this is not his intention, nothing more than the execution of the instructions of the superior, the bag did not resent him, after he was in the bag and the bag passed the letter. After 1958, as well as in the Cultural Revolution, he was hit several times. In the days when they were along, Bao zhejun Zechun found that he was very firm in carrying out the instructions of his superior. Although at that time he and his children were treated extremely unfairly, the majority of police officers were unfair for him, but his tears flowed in his belly and remained diligent at work until he fell ill in his job. This invaluable spirit is the reason that Bao zhejun Zechun most admires him. \\nBao zhejun Che-jun says:\\n'State organs draw the right, first draw us, inform the whole state; today we will be the first to recriminalize the state. It coincidentally. We call statewide celebrities. I think: the state committee is learning from the Ministry of Public Security, informing the state about what we corrected, in order to push the right-wing corrective work across the state.' \\nAfter they looked at the corrective conclusions, they did not make any comments. Comrade Xie Guangmei of the Political Office asked them what difficulties were they needed to subsidize them? 'Indeed, in 21 years, we have encountered many unimaginable difficulties, some of which are not compensated by money. Being able to come back today means that the difficulties have been overcome, and I do not want to increase the burden on the organization anymore. But I ask to go to the political and legal front.' Deng Bingyao, deputy director of the Political Department, replied immediately, saying that Sun Bao zhejunzhong's notice was scheduled to work at the Mengzi County Public Security Bureau, and Bao zhejun was arranged to work in the state procuratorate. They imagined it wrong. At that time, the cadres above the deputy section chief were under state administration, and the Public Security Department could not make a decision. Then they went to the elder chief, united war minister, and the old Red Army Yang Enpu asked, Minister Yang told them: 'Your work is determined by the Standing Committee of the State Committee. It is still afraid that you are not willing to go back to the political and legal front, ready to do your mobilization work. Now you ask to come back, you will be too good. We don't have to move into an 'anti-party group' Sun Bao zhejunzhong is the coach, and Bao zhejun Zhejun is deputy handsome. \\nBao zhejun Zhejun said: 'I returned to Xiangyang in a few days, I received a notice of correction, restore my honor, membership and salary, and informed me to report to Honghe State Procuratorate. It was not too long, and the other three members of the 'anti-party group' also corrected, and the former deputy director of the internal security section Puxingyuan arranged by Mianyang City, Sichuan. Former Deputy Chief of Security Section Song Guojun arranged in Jinping County Public Security Bureau as deputy political committee; Li Xueshi, deputy director of the reform department, has passed away. His two daughters were raised by the Public Security Department until the age of 18, and then helped them find work. At this point, the rehabilitation work of 'anti-party groups' of the Public Security Department has been completed.' \\nIt took 21 years for them to rectify them for months. The tragedies of history, from the beginning of their whole, continued until the end of the 'Cultural Revolution'. Although the youth and lives of many people were sacrificed, the country was finally saved. After a long winter, they cherish the beautiful spring even more. A person does not feel valuable when he gets something, and when he is lost, he feels more valuable. He said: 'I have gained my life politically for the second time. I can have this opportunity to return to the political and legal front. Only double my work to serve the motherland and the people in order to recover the wasted youth!' \\nFriends Reunion\\nBao zhejun Zhejun never counted more personal grudge. His attitude is that past things have passed, abandon the former, and look forward. He said: 'Before we left Xiangyang and left the West, we had asked comrades to eat at home. Comrades also invited us to eat, as if there had never been any kind of criticism in the past. After returning to an old one, I was deputy director of the supervision section of the Inspectorate of the State Procurator's Office. I often went to detention centers and labor units in the whole state city and county. Old comrades from the former public security system had in all counties and cities. Anything I know, I had to visit them. My friends met very enthusiastically and recounted the feelings of parting for more than 20 years. But there is no mention of 1957. Of this, the only one person did not want to meet me. That was the internal service of the Security Department. In 1957, he first criticized me and proposed to classify me as the right. Now he is deputy director at a farm, and I often go to that farm, I would love to talk to him, but she saw me away from old sight. In 1981, after I reassigned to the vice-president of the Intermediate People's Court of Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, kindly notice reminded me: 'Old bag, you are deputy president now, and you want to take the initiative to find something. ' I said, must be! Unfortunately, every time I went to the farm, he was still away. I did not have much chance to go later, and I never met him. It may be that he looked too heavy at that time, he didn't want to see me, he felt guilty, and I just felt sorry.' \\nAnother time in Jianshui County, he heard that Comrade Yang Ze from the former Mengzi Public Security Bureau worked at the county family planning office. Bao zhejun Zhe took the initiative to visit him. Comrade Yang Ze was one year younger than him, but Yang Ze was a leader in the underground party. After liberation, he was deputy director of the Mengzi County Public Security Bureau. Bao zhejun Zhejun, while supporting the Mengzi County Public Security Bureau, worked under his leadership to reconnaissance and solve the case. Yang Ze is a comrade with both ability and courage. Therefore, in 1953 he was transferred to Lincang Public Security Department as deputy director. They were 27 years alone. 'I don't know anything about Comrade Yang Ze,' recalled Bao zhejun. I walked into his office, only him alone, he remembers me, and he greeted me warmly to sit. After I sat, I asked him: Lao Yang, where have you been for over 20 years, how can you hear a little message?' \\nHe replied, 'I heard your situation. As for my situation, you will not know, and you always thought I was in Lincang. It's hard to say. In 1953, I moved to the Cang Public Security Department, and soon became deputy director, and my work was also smooth. In 1957, rushed me to the right, and sent me back to build water to supervise the labor in rural areas. My wife did not want to go back to the countryside. I divorced me in Lincang. I led my eldest daughter back to build water. She was pregnant and she ran all things. Fortunately, hometown people are not harsh on me, for more than 20 years I have been in the countryside to make up the pot to survive. Later, I set up another home in the countryside. After the correction in 1979, I was reluctant to return to Lincang, Jianshui County Committee arranged for me to engage in family planning work. I am a layman, a little unfit, anyway by learning and doing it.' \\n'How many kids do you have now?' BAO Zhejun asked. \\n'The ex-wife gave birth to two, my eldest daughter I brought back, and now this wife has two more, there are three people around me, older daughters are working, and the little ones are still studying.' Yang Ze replied. \\n'What about the other child of your ex-wife?' Bau Che-jun asked again. \\n'The talk is long.' Yang Ze answered a sentence sadly, shaking his head, and then said:\\n'After the divorce of my ex-wife and I, soon returned to Monzi and gave birth to a daughter named Yang Lan, and she married her daughter again. My older daughter often writes to her because she is always the mother of her daughter. Daughter often writes to ask her sister how she looks like. Her mother also frequently wrote back and sent pictures of her sister. Jianshui is only 100 kilometers from Mengzi, this 20 years due to busy life, I have never been able to see Xiaolan. In 1979, my right was corrected, and I went back to work, and my eldest daughter asked me to pick up her sister back, and I embarked on the road to Monzi at the supervision of my eldest daughter. To Mengzi, I found my ex-wife by the address on the letter. The ex-wife came out and pulled me to the south lake to speak without letting me step into her house. We went on the way of fewer people and sat down next to a big tree. The South Lake of Kubetsu has changed and has become beautiful. However, I didn't think to see the scenery, but wanted to see my daughter, Little Lan. I opened the first sentence to ask:\\n'What about our daughter Little Lan? Where does she work?' \\nThe ex-wife cried at once, cried very sad. I asked her, 'What whole? Give is not there (meaning death)?' She replied, 'There is no death. Because 1958 life difficult, adults do not eat enough milk enough baby, I fear to starve her to death, sent to you, have not come to your home, I think about your life in the countryside is also difficult, did not give you, I am on the way back, passing a village next to the city, I do not recognize what village name, I want to hug back Go to death, it is better to throw in this big road, perhaps in the face of good people to pick up and escape. And I put Little Lan in the drylands by the roadside. Xiaolan cry, I also cry, I try to feed her last milk, she can not suck milk, more cry, I cry more. I took Xiaolan up and put it down, a few hold a few, in the end it was the flesh that fell on me, I would not have to do it!' \\nThe ex-wife said here cried for a while before continuing:\\n'In the end there is really no way, I'm fiercely finally put down Xiaolan, our mother and son cried apart, I was like a knife stranded. Say, she cried again, and I have been grieving and tears. After I calm down, I asked again: 'You didn't always write that Xiaolan was very good, and sent a picture of Xiaolan! How now... 'She said, 'The doll on the photo was born after I got married to the back. I'm afraid of your sadness, take the picture of this girl down with the pictures of Little Lan to coax you. I asked, 'Do you remember the place you lost? ' She said, 'Remember. ' I said, 'So let's go find it together, okay? ' She said, 'I found it, and now it's a big girl in her 20s, and may be married! ' Even though she said, she came with me to build water to find her daughter. We came to a small village near the city of Jianshui County and found an old village chief. We asked him, 'Daddy, did you find a little girl in the ground in 1958? ' And coincidentally, the old village chief answered, Yes. In 1958, a production captain in our village, he went to the water one morning, walking on the road as if he heard a little doll crying, he was strange, how could there be a little doll crying in the field? He went through the crying, and saw a small yellow ant in the roadside drylands wrapped in a baby baby face. Little doll crying is already very weak. He shouted out, 'Which little doll is it? Which little doll is it? No one answered, he looked at nobody around, and he understood that it was lost because of life difficulties. He thinks someone is still a life again, and he will hold the little doll back to me. Exactly, there was an old couple in our village with no children, and I took the little baby to find the old couple. After they saw the little doll, they were happy to take it down. At that time was the large cafeteria quantitative, this picked up little doll without rations, the old two in the cafeteria only played a meal back to eat together, another collar rice back to grind into rice flour, boiled rice milk to feed the little doll. The old two were so hungry to feed the little baby, later the big cafeteria scattered, life was a little better, this little girl was lively and lovely, people loved, later went to primary school, to the age of 9, her life was bad, sick, old two cry to die to live, good for a long time were dementia. The old village chief did not know that we were the parents of this girl, and finally said a sentence, 'This girl's dad is too hard. If not lost, it may still be alive. ' My ex-wife listened to another crying, and I fell tears too. The old village chief showed that we were the parents of the dead girl. And he said, 'Sorry, sorry! That kind of years, you also have your difficulties! Indeed, if the old village chief knew our truth, he would never grieve us again, so I broke up with my ex-wife again. My eldest daughter cried several times after listening to me and her mother's Thymile hunt. It took a long time to slowly fade. But my heart is always hidden, and never forget the daughter that never met, Little Lan!' \\nIn the process of listening to Comrade Yang Ze's narrative, I could not help but drop tears, and then said some consolation words from Yang Ze. Soon, Yang Ze Jianshui County Procuratorate was the Attorney General, and they met on a common front. However, they no longer dare to make their home routine. \\nIn the process of visiting the old comrades, one day, Bao zhejun Zhejun met a special old comrade in Mengzi County, he was in the early life of the farm with the same group is paved old friends. When he saw him, Bao zhejun Zhejun first was surprised, thought it was a ghost, but immediately calm down, half jokingly said:\\n'Lao Li, I hear you were hacked to death on the farm by two flat burdens, how come back again!' \\nLao Li said: 'The old bag, a hard word, you and I can still meet, it is also the life of all of us. I didn't eat enough on the farm, two people took some of the peanuts from the public, and two children went to see and criticize us, the activists shouted: 'Get out of the little right! Say hello blood splashes on the body! ' Then we cut the two of us with the flat burden, and a few flat burdens hacked us both. The team did not blame which one, but sent a few people dragged us out to dig the pit, buried another, then buried me. When I buried the other one and then came to bury me, one of the good guys covered my nose with his hand and found that I was still breathing, and I quickly brought me to the hospital to rescue, and I had to live back and was almost buried alive. This time, the restoration of my public office and party membership did not really think, I would be a second man again. The part I was hit, now it rains and hurts at any time...' said, his eyes were red. Bao zhejun Zhejun was busy comforting a few words and opened the topic, went to his residence to visit a bit and recalled some past events. Yes, the farm for so many years, labor closed, months used to it, but life off sad. Some comrades were hungry at night, boiling salt and drinking water, the hungry, the hungry to drink, and finally suffered from edema disease, and some died. There are hungry smoke, tobacco addictions, have no money to buy, how to do it? Specially pick up people's cigarette pot, people have not yet sucked on looking at, watching people throw cigarette butts, pick up a breath to suck cigarette butts, because there was no filter. Bao zhejun Zechun said: 'I look in the eyes, sad in my heart, I decidedly decided that this life will never learn to smoke! Later, I did, and so far, tobacco and alcohol did not stick.' \\nSpeak a fair word\\nComrade Li Xueshi, a Hebei province, his parents died prematurely, and his grandmother led him to beg for the day. At the end of 1937, only a 12-year-old poem was taken by the Eighth Route Army on his way to dinner, and since then he became the Little Eight Way. Learn poetry only to know the grandmother, who scolds his grandmother when he was young, he will fight. Later, his grandmother's whereabouts were unknown, and the Eighth Route Army became his family and his home. Although the poems were young, the war was very brave. In the anti-Japanese battlefield, a small poem had spelled bayonets with enemy soldiers. Later, the Eighth Route Army streamlined him down, but, learning poems homeless, still followed the troops, the troops marched him, the troops marched him, the troops played him out of the war, the troops fought him to fight, the troops opened meals, and he was unable to drive away, and the head of the regiment, Youtaizhong had to put him into the ranks. After that, in the anti-Japanese war and the war of liberation, he made more than 10 more battles and won more than 10 medals. \\nIn 1950 he was transferred to the Mengzi Public Security Department. In 1952, when a public security corps bustled bandits in five miles in Jianshui County, the poetry was sent by the Public Security Department to build water. One day, the army, organ cadres and militias surrounded more than 10 bandits on the top of a stone hilltop. The bandits resisted with mountain stones as a cover, and the public security fighters were injured on several occasions. When the head of the delegation was in a hurry, attending a poem surrounded by bandits asked the head of the team to fight. The head of the team saw him in a gray cadre uniform, a little distrust, and asked him, 'Have you ever fought a war?' Learn poetry Lizheng said: 'The head of the report, I'm the troops coming up and down.' The head said: 'The enemy is stubborn, are you sure?' 'I have seen the situation with my own eyes, I am sure!' The head said, 'Well, what weapons do you want?' Learn to know that the head of the delegation asked this kind of question, that is to agree to his call for war, he was very excited, he hasn't fought for a long time, immediately another upright, and replied loudly: 'The head of the report, no other weapons can be used, I will need more than 10 grenades!' Looking at this younger local cadre, the head of the team nodded his head and agreed. He called the soldiers around the grenade on the back of his body all pumped to learn poetry, learn poetry to put the grenade on the waist, one hand and mention another one, with mountain stone as cover, from behind a stone below a step jump to above Behind a stone, step by step close to the top, bandits shot after a shot of bullets are not able to hit the old sand field Learn poetry, finally learn poetry and bandits only one stone apart, only 5 meters away. \\nAt this time, learn to squat down, the grenade in his hands threw a breath, listen to the bandits nothing quietly, learn poetry to stand up command shouting: 'comrades, punch ah!' Public security fighters rushed up together, but none of the bandits saw. At the beginning, everyone also suspected whether the bandits run down the hill. Later, the head of the team asked the soldiers to search carefully. Originally, more than a dozen bandits were blown up by more than a dozen hand grenades that learned poetry, and they were all reimbursed. \\nIn this way, the entire civil-military withdrawal from the fighting. The head of the delegation thanked for learning poetry and praised poetry. In 1955, the poetry was deputy director of the reform department, but in 1957 was classified as the right by the Honghe State Public Security Department. Bao zhejun Che-jun was thinking: learning poetry is an orphan who wants to eat. It was the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army pulled him up. Where did his anti-party ideology come from? In 1962, after learning poetry from Wolong Valley Farm and went to Dongfeng Farm, there was a meeting, Bao zhejun Che-jun met him outside the Dongfeng Farm Auditorium. He said to the bag at that time, 'I never thought about the 1957 thing.' At that time, the bag could not let him know, but advised him: 'These things are only said later, you take care of your body, because you have stomach ulcers.' Whoever knows these words are their farewell words. If he was not a 'right-wing', an old revolution like this would definitely be saved on the farm before the 'Cultural Revolution'. I was very sad when I heard about poetry.' \\nIn March 1979, when implementing the policy, the Public Security Department promised to raise Li Xueshi's eldest daughter Li Yuping until the age of 18 before helping arrange work. Bao zhejun Zhejun went to the State Procuratorate for more than a year. Yuping was 18 years old, but the Public Security Department did not bear the word to help find a job. Jin Qiongmei, the original wife who learned poetry, was very anxious, she led Yuping to an old find Bao zhejun Zhejun. Although learning poetry is a '38 style old cadre, it is very good to get along with the 'liberation' card recruits. Now, the child who learns poetry does not have a job, and the new comrade, Che Jun is certainly obliged to run for it. Bao zhejun Zhejun led Jin Qiongmei and Yuping their mother and daughter to Deputy Secretary Li Kongzong and Deputy Director Wang of the Public Security Department. Bao zhejun said to them: Two old chiefs, learning poetry is your old comrades. Although the people's world cannot be said to learn poetry, he always attended. He was born to death, and he did not die on the battlefield, but died on the farm. Now his children do not ask for a high official, but for a bowl of rice. The poem is dead, he will not speak, only our living comrades speak for him... Bao zhejun Che-jun's throat seems to have something choked and can not go down, Jin Qiongmei, Yuping dried tears and whispered. Deputy Secretary Li and Deputy Director Wang were also very saddened. Deputy Secretary Li and Deputy Director Wang said, 'Pouch, no To say that, we must find a way to arrange a job for Yuping.' Later Yuping was recruited as workers from the farm in Jianshui Yang Street. A year later, with the help of good comrades, he moved to the Jianshui Department Store to work again. As comrades, Bao zhejun Che-jun can only do this meager to convince comrades to learn poetry in the spirit of heaven. [Yin Mu, A Rough Way of a Judge, German Publishing House, 1998]"}

It is the masses who are working hard and hard and full of rhetoric about Marxism; the black hands (the masses), work, and the white hands (party members), start their homes. He said that 'there is sectarianism throughout the country,' and that non-party cadres and the party are 'peaceful coexistence'. The Party 'does not have a sense of heart, but with each other's heart,' so 'non-party cadres do not dare to make friends with party members to say what they know'. 'Fear of saying something wrong, (party members), to write them on the general record... mention the political side to pack you up.' Now, 'non-party cadres also think to avoid when they meet party members on the road.' He divided the party members into three categories: 1. 'Trainee', 'When I hear a non-party comrade say a wrong word, he is criticizing him as a small radio'; 2. 'Monitor' the masses, 'give you a note, wait for the year-end appraisal... to give you a breach of the party's prestige'; 3. 'The whole person', 'Assembly point (masses), name, according to the typical criticism'. Non-party cadres close to Communist Party members have 'three characteristics': 'The first machinery executes the instructions of the superiors, the following dry; second look at the color face of the superiors to act, the superiors pointing east to the east; the third pair of the leader Ami is welcome...'\\n'Although the party members of the People's Bank of the People's Bank of China have not affixed the four big characters of 'Communist Party members', as long as you look, you will know that they are members of the Communist Party. 'Party members are not the same as ordinary people, they (they), walk like the old man on the stage, take a step, speak like officials, export trainees, the eye is the goldfish eye turned over...'\\nHe said that the Party 'sat alone' throughout the country and implemented 'paternalistic leadership', and that trade unions and administration were 'the tail of the party' and 'shouted' on behalf of the Party. In leading the work of the State organs, the Party commits the problem of 'business (doctrine)'. 'The Party Committee is a decision-making body, and should not be done on a matter matter.' 'Party members and cadres rely on the party to eat' 'old cadres don't understand business, low level of culture... do not understand and do not learn... Sitting on a comfortable chair all day long... sucking cigarettes, drinking strong tea looking at the ceiling' 'relying on stamped signatures, approving official documents, meeting reports and so on... issuing orders'. He said that the authority of leading cadres relied on 'three magic treasures (official shelves, big hats, hard sticks)' and 'a pair of embroidered shoes.' Cadres who say that today 'truly talented' are subject to (Party), repression, and everywhere are 'Vino Nuo' cadres, 'there is nothing... suitable to apply', instead 'according to the 'long' lover level, according to the 'long' love assigns the work', 'wife with expensive, living in four class' and 'first class is looking to heaven, that is, personnel protection work; second class is running the street, that is, the field; third class is the drawing that is, accounting; fourth class is smoke, i.e. 'The cashier's job' 'only the lover of section chief and governor' is entitled to do the 'first class' job.

Stigma attacks and attempts to bring down the Communist Party\\n(1), The defamation of the party has been degraded and cannot represent the interests of the people:\\nBao zhutao Zhutao said: 'After the Communist Party gained power, it has changed quality. Now it is using various means to rule to confuse the people. Therefore, the Communist Party has gone downhill, and one day will exaggerate itself,' he said to Zhang Zhan and Luo Shenyun: 'It is clear that the current reality (refers to the party), is like a broken water. Fruit, on the surface is still bright red, but just uncover its skin , it can be seen that inside it is corrupt, raw insects. I want to facilitate the process of peeling'. 'The Communist Party can represent the interests of the people in a certain period of history, and now the Communist Party can no longer represent the interests of the people.' Therefore, he declared at the June 6 'freedom and liberation' conference: 'Now our main task is not busy to sing the party and affirmation of the party's achievements, but to expose the party's shortcomings'. 'Over the years, because of the harm (three), harm has caused many losses to the people.' Is it possible that the people still retain their initial prestige over him? Is it appropriate to raise the slogan that represents the interests of the people while treating the party's disease for the party?' I just point out that at present the party's prestige among the people has apparently been deducted and, in some cases, has even lost the trust of the people. Therefore, it is clearly not humble to emphasize the role of the party in this trend'. \\n(2), Stigma the party is arbitrary rule:\\nBao zhutao Zhutao said to Zhang Zhan, Luo Shenyun and others before he said: 'The Communist Party is so arbitrary. I hit the world to ask me for my seat,' he also cited an example: 'A man saved a girl in a distress. After that, I said that I have the right to take possession of this girl, whether she wants or not, and does not give him freedom. Right.' He said, 'The Communist Party is so unique to the Party.' 'I think the people themselves will know how to solve them. The Chinese people know the truth. The Chinese people know how to do it, and the Chinese people know how to do it, and have infinite power is 600 million people, not the Communist Party.' 'It seems that only if the Party is well formed can the people be saved, and the nation will not be extinguished. This is not sectarianism. What is it? What is this not the only idea of the party?' He also openly told the masses: 'China is now the Communist Party in one hand.' \\n(3), ugly and attacking the party:\\nBefore the release, Bao zhutao Zhutao once said to Zhang Zhan and Luo Shenyun: 'As long as the Communist Party is flattering and flattering, as long as you shout a few more voices in your mouth to 'support' 'long live', it will be favoured. As for what you think in the bones, you don't have to 'The Communist Party is a hotbed for the cultivation of both factions,' added: 'Joining the party is for personal purposes, as long as there is money official position and party membership in love. This social style must be reformed.' He also stigmatized members of the party, saying: 'It is clear that Guilin landscape is good. You (refer to the party members), but said: How beautiful the rivers and mountains of the motherland,' I firmly oppose. He also said: 'The party criticizes some of the practices of asking for a retrial of whether Hu Feng is anti-revolutionaries for fear of exposing its sore scars.' \\n(4), Chairman Mao, who defamates the party leader:\\n'The people's support for Chairman Mao is completely blind worship of idols, and there is no difference from the previous worship of Chiang Kai-shek,' he said. \\nHe once said to Zhang Zhan and Luo Shenyun: Humanity has two major requirements, one is material requirements, the first is a spiritual requirement. The ordinary people just draw on the material requirements, like landlords and capitalists. Our leader, Chairman Mao, attaches great importance to political prestige and is not willing to easily admit his shortcomings. Therefore, the shortcomings are becoming more and more serious, to the point where it is 'difficult to ride a tiger.' \\n(5), attempt to overthrow the party:\\nBefore the release, Bao zhutao Zhutao said to his group Zhang Zhan and Luo Shenyun: 'Now the majority of the people across the country are dissatisfied with the Party, including workers, farmers, soldiers, and especially intellectuals are even more. If the Communist Party does not change its methods, the time is ripe, as long as someone 'cheers the arms' will be 'a lot of people' and said: In the midst of people in the midst of deep water, some people waged war to solve the problem. That would be better than living now. 'During the opening of our hospital, he said to Zhang Zhan and Luo Shenyun: 'The Communist Party should be close to the people, listen humbly and seriously repent. As for what method the people use to make clear, how should the people use? Naruto what? The Communist Party should not interfere'. And he said, 'I say I have a political platform, and that is, anarchism. In the poem he wrote on June 6, 'It's time', using the words 'except three harm', said: to dig their roots (referring to the Communist Party), to completely destroy the 'three harm', not exaggerate the 'three harm', and resolutely not to recruit soldiers. To step forward on the ruins of the 'three hazards'. He also said to Zhang Zhan and Luo Shenyun that if I want to behead, I would like the first to lose the head.' He also said: 'The Communist Party's proposal to rectify the issue is due to the seriousness of the Hungarian events. Now students are on fire, not by chance, it's a long time for the majority of students. We intellectuals are responsible for grievances for the people. 'Now the people across the country are openly opposed to the Communist Party, and the time has come for the Communist Party to exaggerate.' He also said: 'Let the people see the Communist Party's arbitrariness, prompting the people's dissatisfaction with the Communist Party, even if sacrificed.' \\nHe once said: 'The intellectuals don't have a political party, they want to have, then do everything well.' He encouraged opposition elements to rise to overthrow the party, saying, 'You eat you without eating people (referring to the party).' \\n(6), Attack on the party leadership of the people's armed:\\n'In order to consolidate its rule, the Communist Party has concentrated most of the material for military defense construction,' he said. He also said: 'Most of our country are recruits, who have insufficient experience in fighting, have not been trained in their fighting, and they are not satisfied with the life of the troops. Therefore, if China continues, there will be a riot.' \\nIn the past, he said in the army: 'Region-level cadres are mechanized, (meaning puppets), battalion-level cadres wives, and platoon company cadres speak strange words.' \\nHe also believes that 'the revolutionary forces are invisible locks, hidden flails, stifling the youth of people'. \\nII. Defamation of attacks and attempts to overthrow the socialist system\\n1, Bao zhutao zhu Tao to reform the socio-economic system, political measures, social style:\\nBefore releasing, Bao zhutao Zhutao said to his group Zhang Zhan and Luo Shenyun: 'If you want to pick up a gun rod to 'revolution', I'm afraid it will not be possible for the time being, or implement political reform.' At the 'Ming Fang Conference' on June 6, he said, 'while resolving the internal contradictions of the people, will inevitably affect their socio-economic system, political measures and social style reform,' he said to Zhang Zhan and Luo Shenyun: 'The overall purchase and sale is very bad, the supply of the market is also very bad,' he said, 'We Changsha,' he said 'There is a frozen meat factory, and the frozen meat produced is not sold at all. They are all to please the Soviet Union.' \\n2, slanting attacks on China's socialist political system is not democratic and free:\\nBao zhutao Zhutao is extremely dissatisfied with the fundamental system of our country-the people's congress system, and the people's democratic system. He fundamentally denied that: 'Now China is the Communist Party, and the electoral system is very undemocratic. If you elect people's representatives, I don't think I have been elected at all. 'I don't think I have been elected at all. Right'. He told the classmates: 'I advocate the Western bourgeois election method and, if necessary, we can also use 'campaign mode,' and 'run freely'. In front of Ming Fang, he said to his group Zhang Zhan and Luo Shenyun: 'What freedom of speech exists? Only according to the words of the people (referring to the party), cannot go beyond the 'thunder pool' step. If a different opinion is made, there is a danger of being tied to reactionary and counter-revolutionary caps. Even if you don't mean to propagate reactionary remarks, you will suffer the same.' Luo Shenyun once said with life and death: now there is no freedom to commit suicide. When he dies, he adds the charge of 'no need to have something to do', saying that 'fear of suicidal suicide' did not die, he said it was a threat to the leadership. 'Now not only does not have the right to life, but even the right to death has been denied,' Bao zhutao said. \\nBao zhutao Zhutao told Zhang Zhan and Luo Shenyun: 'Although the farmers of the Tang Dynasty are oppressed, there is freedom to say that now the Communist Party has given farmers land, there is no freedom to say two more words.' 'There is no freedom in this society, not only the press, profession, the army, but also freedom of the press. There is only the Xinhua family in the country, and a lot of news has been blocked at all.' He thinks: 'Tao Yuanming can Tian Yin, Bai Ju Yi can 'public hidden'. In this society there is no freedom of seclusion.' \\nIn the past, he said in the army: 'The world is dark and truly liberated unless another revolution is made.' And he said, 'I don't have freedom of speech at all right now. Human beings have a natural right to the person, to be absolutely free, democratic and not subject to organizational discipline.' \\nHe wrote a number of slogans during the resignation, such as 'Fighting for Democracy, Fighting for Conscience'! 'Fight for freedom!' 'Those who have resentment, do not silence'! 'Those who have conscience, do not silence'! 'No freedom, rather than die'! 'People are equal before nature.' 'The monarchs give you the crown of law, not nature, etc.' \\n3. Defame and attempt to completely eliminate our personnel file system, and slander the anti-movement:\\nBao zhutao Zhu Tao wrote many slogan big print during the opening, attacking our country's archives system. He said: 'Archives are books of life and death.' 'Archives are the tools used by the Tsar to monitor the people'. On June 5, we launched a signature in the class, asking for 'open files', he said, 'Hu Feng is all wronged, because Hu Feng will not brag.'\\n4. Bao zhutao Zhu Tao wants to establish a 'new society of communist economy and Western democracy'. Before the release, Bao zhutao said to Zhang Zhan and Luo Shenyun, 'There is no head in this society, capitalist countries have freedom of publishing, and there can be 'creation'. So we can go to a foreign country or Hong Kong. Now we should learn foreign languages (English), and make friends in Hong Kong.' 'Although the economic monopoly of capitalist countries is not good, the communist economy in the East plus the democratic politics of the West is fine.' \\nThird, oppose Marxism and spread reactionary philosophical and literary views. \\n1. Opposition against Marxinism:\\n'Marxism is too dogmatic, too monotonous,' he said. 'Marxinism works for the born minions.' \\nHis defamation of Marxist-Leninist teachers was a 'soundworm without study.' 'Political education is hollow, always a few words'. 'All people who eat on politics are liars, talk to me about politics. It is simply selling dog plaster.' \\nTrafficking in drugs of reactionary 'skepticism' 'humanism':\\n(1), 'Skepticism': He said that my view of things is 'affirmative on the basis of negative', that is, do not have any prejudices in advance, and do not be guided by any worldview. 'All the good things in this society propaganda are questionable,' he said: 'The general purchase and sale is very bad, the market supply is also very bad', and the distribution of goods by urban and rural superiors and subordinate organs is fundamentally unequal.' He doubted the current situation in the Soviet Union and said: I feel that looking at the Soviet Union from the film and some of its materials alone, I can not be sure, because I watched Chinese films such as 'when grapes are riving' and I feel that the situation reflected therein is not representative, and life in the countryside is not as good as he described.' \\n(2), 'Humanity': He said, 'What is truth? Man, that's the truth'. He also said: 'People stand before nature are equal', and wrote a slogan and said: class is drawn out by man, 'class theory' is not 'human nature'. He also said: 'Overcoming Berlin' and 'Upper Ganling' and other films are all propaganda killing. \\n3. Dissemination of reactionary literary views:\\nBao zhutao Zhutao told his group Zhang Zhan and Luo Shenyun and other people before opening, 'Literature and art do not necessarily serve politics, there should be no political standards, nor should there be any correct world view to guide.' He also said: 'Now the literary route is too dead. What is the direction of service for workers and farmers, so it has produced a serious formula and conceptualization'. His attitude to socialist realism is: 'I don't listen to this set at all,' he publicly declared: 'At present, there are many academic or theoretical things in China that are transported or copied from the Soviet Union, committing serious dogmatism.' Then to Zhang Zhan, Wang Suiyun, said: 'I accept the literary fiction and film of Western European capitalism'. He also said that literature and art should not serve politics, should not serve workers and farmers, and that art is above all. \\nIV. Attacks and denigration of the Soviet Union, distorting the events in Hungary. \\nAttacks on the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, undermining the unity of the socialist countries:\\nHe said to Zhang Zhan and Luo Shenyun two: 'The Soviet Union asked people not to use atomic weapons, but to manufacture their own atomic weapons. This is the arms race.' He also said: 'At the beginning and end of the events in Belia, the announcement was not exhaustive, and Molotov and so on could not even understand the simple truth.' He saw cooperation between the Soviet Union and other democracies as exploitative. He said: 'It is always unfair to trade between the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, and the Soviet Union replaced one kilogram of steel for two pounds of pork. Their lives are richer because they are cheaper in trade'. Also told Zhang Zhan and Luo Shenyun two people: 'The current regime in our country is dependent on the Soviet Union, otherwise the people will rise up to resist.' \\n2. Distortion of events in Hungary:\\nWhen the Hungarian incident occurred, he pleated to Zhang Zhan, Luo Shenyun and others: 'The Hungarian incident is good, it is the result of people's rise to demand the overthrow of the current regime and resist bureaucratic rule.' He also said: 'Soviet troops are not in accordance with international military formalities and are interfering in Hungary's internal affairs.' (1957.11.00)\\n"},

The backlash of the confrontation movement collapsed. \\nThe thing is like this:\\nSince the Party Central Committee proposed the whole party, for a month or two months, because of the great or the elders headed by President Liang's episode of 'three hurts', our hospital has been quiet and has been quietly. Recently, because of the situation and the solidarity of the brother's colleges, the classmates have spontaneously sounded up. At the request of the masses of indignation, the fake students who have been beaten properly have finally notified the formation of a 'Student Shining Committee' (hereinafter referred to as the 'Ming Committee'). Each class will elect a representative, together with the former Chairman of the Student Union (Lau Ta Yuen). The inaugural meeting began at 7:00pm on June 6. From the beginning until the election of the Standing Committee, Liu Dayuan presided over and recorded. After the election of the Standing Committee, these little guys who were usually stepped under their feet and had no experience of working experience because they were excessively excited to see that they were representative of the masses, they decided not to pass the masses: to issue a telegram to the provincial committee secretary to lead the movement. At this time, Liu Da-yuan did not mention Make any objections and also promise to come up with money to shoot telegrams. \\nAt the end of the meeting, Liu Dayuan stole the list of members of the 'Ming Committee'. An hour later, a few 'student union' cadres, numbering two and two, misappropriated the class name at the radio station on the pretext that the class was not represented (in fact, to give up the right to participate), denied this genuine student organization, and Call all students in the name of 'Student Union' at around 12 o'clock in the evening General Assembly is open in the auditorium At the same time, they also held the radio station and prevented the director of the 'Ming Committee' from revealing the truth of the problem to the students. \\nAt the conference, student union cadres still manipulated the venue, using such means as defaming the 'Naruto Committee' and not allowing its chairman to speak in order to confuse the hearing. As a small group of students shouted 'consent', they announced the withdrawal of the organization. \\nWhy would these students agree? It's just a look at their vicious means to know. \\nMembers of the Ming Committee were surrounded by them and could not attend the meeting. Only one chairman committee was present. They also said that they seized the microphone (microphone), and prevented him from telling the truth. After their classmates had stopped this kind of anti-democratic style more than once, he was allowed to speak. When speaking, they were loud and loud, making the classmates unclear. The two double (which cannot be written here), members (that is, the Ming Committee, and also a student union cadre), pretended to withdraw from the organization. \\nHow do they slander? \\nFirst, they distorted the leadership of the 'Ming Committee' not President Liang (Secretary of the Council Committee), and distorted to not lead the party. \\nSecond, the Ning Committee did not discuss the issue at all by the Ning Committee on the other day before the establishment of the Ning Committee as an instigating strike by the Ning Committee. (as evidenced by a record)\\nThird, the classmates asked (write slogans), to seize the party sticks suppressed by 'anti-revolutionary' hat,' Luo Yisheng, as 'Ming Committee' is going to seize Luo Yisheng. \\nQuestion: The Naruto Committee was set up less than four hours, and more than two o'clock of those meetings were in session, and immediately after the meeting were surrounded separately. Under such circumstances, is it possible for the members of the Ning Committee to do these two things? Is there a need for it? Moreover, the Naruto Committee could not reveal the true image of the problem. In addition, how can the student union cadres take the lead in shouting without a small group of students 'agreeing'? (Most students did not express their opinion)\\nIn addition to the telegram issue, Liu Dayuan did not give an opinion during the discussion. Later, he also offered money. Immediately after the meeting, use this matter as an excuse to oppose the people. Even if the procedure for this action is wrong, can Liu Dayuan not be responsible? What about the NOC does not have any experience in dealing with such problems at all? \\nJudging from the speed of the 'Student Union' to abolish the 'Naruto Committee', the sinister means and the secrecy of the action, this is a new conspiracy of sectarianism, a systematic and organized suppression of democracy, behind the scenes with a cunning and multi-pronged messenger. \\nFor this reason, as defender of justice, we will make the real situation publicly available to the world, appeal to the community, appeal to the Party Central Committee, ask you to give just referees, give vigorous support to help us clear the 'three hazards' of Guangxi Teachers College to completely resolve internal conflicts among the people and build a society under the leadership of the Party.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attachment 3]Bao zhutao Zhutao: 'Speech at the Ming Fang Conference' (1957.06.06)\\nWe are not only to make the party sound and consolidate (although the integrity and consolidation of the party are related to the people), but mainly to enable the social, economic and political system to move forward freely, democratically and soundly, and to ensure that the rights and interests of the people can be truly guaranteed. \\nThe purpose of President Liang's proposal in the plenary meeting on June 5 is to help the whole party without mentioning other issues. We believe that this formulation is not comprehensive enough to be clear enough and is questionable. \\nWe believe that it was right to propose the 'purpose of revelation in order to help the whole party' in the first place, and we believe that 'revelation' can also help the whole party, but from the current development of the 'nudge', from the point of view of the scope and content of the liberation, it is clear that the purpose of the liberation is limited only to helping the whole party. Comprehensive enough, because the ultimate aim of the revelation is not only to get the whole party movement. However, instead, we should completely resolve the internal contradictions of the people and, while resolving internal conflicts among the people, will inevitably affect certain economic systems, political measures, social style and other issues of innovation. This is what most people hope to achieve in the revelation. If they simply say it is for the whole party, can you explain the problem? Of course, we do not want some party organizations, but only for the sake of the whole party, but also want to solve practical problems. \\nWell, some people will say that the Party represents the interests of the people, has done well the work of the whole party, and the internal contradictions of the people will naturally resolve. Of course, we also acknowledge that the Chinese Communist Party has indeed done a lot of useful things for the people. In a certain period of history, he can represent the interests of the people, but we also know that now we The main task, is not busy with sing and affirming the party's achievements, but to expose The shortcomings of the Party have made it possible to improve. In fact, over the years due to the harm of the 'three harm', it has brought a lot of losses to the people. This is well known. Whether from the national level or from the problems revealed by the Court, the Party should be responsible, and the Party has shortcomings is certain, or the whole party can solve people. The internal contradictions of the people have been raised from this basis. Since this is the case, then the people want to maintain the original Party. Prestige, is not possible yet! Is it appropriate to raise the slogan that represents the interests of the people while treating the party's disease for the party? Of course, I am not a word to deny the role of the party, I am sure the role of the party, but it will be in the future! Then we need to look at the results of the whole party. We hope that the party will be loved by the people in the future. That is the aftermath. Here I just want to point out that the current party's prestige among the people has obviously been compromised, and on some issues it has even lost the trust of the people. Therefore, in this trend, it is clear that the role of the Party is emphasized. Not humbly. \\nSome people may say that internal contradictions among the people and other problems need to be resolved, but first of all, the party should be reorganized, and other issues later resolved. I think this argument is also inappropriate. I think that the people of the people themselves will know to solve them. The Chinese people understand the truth. The Chinese people understand the truth. It knows how to do it. It is 600 million people with endless power, not the party, and the party can play a leading role and advanced role. But it does not play a decisive role. So, why can't we resolve internal contradictions within the people at the same time with the whole party? And to put the main aim on the whole party, it seems that only the people of the Party can be saved and won't forget the country's extinction. This is not what sectarianism is? What is this not the idea of only party esteem? \\nNot to say that the purpose of 'sweeping' is for the whole party. I think the word 'help' is not appropriate. Of course, the people's liberation is to help the whole party. Wouldn't the people stand in the guest seat? We are the master of the country. Since the Party is a representative of the people, the Party's good or bad is related to the fate of the whole country, then the people should never help the whole party, but monitor the Party's winds. \\nDetermining that the purpose of 'liberation' is only for the whole party, and it is stipulated that the target is only three harm (President Liang pointed out that issues other than the three harm can also be mentioned. I feel still restrictive), this seems to be saying, OK! Our party is ready for the wind! Naruto! Let you all sing for me! Is this a humble attitude? Since the Party has the determination to correct its mistakes, it should be close to the people, listen sincerely and repent seriously, as to the way the people use to sound and sing something! That is the matter of the people. After the settlement of the contradictions has been mentioned on the agenda, there are limits between the critics and the critics. The wisdom of the people is endless. The Party can rest assured that the people will never have nothing to do, and the Party's task is only to adopt opinions and should not interfere in less than a small amount. In the report, three times stressed that the aim of 'revelation' was for the whole party, and did not mention anything else, It is not as true as above, it is difficult to understand.

Large print newspapers on campus are flooded, and the debate on the 'Democratic Forum' takes place day and night. Some deviations had been revealed at that time, such as physical attacks in the big print; the 'democratic forum' was in poor order. \\nOn this, Ziyan and I have views. The party committee secretary and secretary of the party committee asked Qiao Youmei (currently vice president of Shandong University. At that time, he was the chairman of the whole school student union, a member of the Communist Party, the secretary of the team branch), and buns Yan, and asked him (her), to reverse the chaos. To control the radio station, make the big debate order normal. At the same time, it was suggested that an organization could be formed, if necessary, under the direct direction of the Committee, and the necessary supplies were also supplied by the Committee. \\nOne night, Xiao Qiao and Ziyan came to my bedroom to discuss how to implement the instructions of the Party Committee and the League Committee. Finally, seven people, including Qiao Youmei, Buzi Yan and I initiated the establishment of 'Ming Fang Society'. \\nAt that time, we only knew that my class had been running ahead in sports and activities, but this time it was behind. Since the party committee and the regiment committee want us to actively invest, we should catch up with it.

The vast majority of the members of the society are party and team members, and have also done some good things for the Party and the people in order to help the Party rectify. \\nBut in the fight against the right in the next June, some people in my class insisted that 'Ming Fangsha' was a right-wing organization. Qiao Yumei, Bun Yan, and key backbone were all right-wing elements. (Commemorative Collection of Bun Zi Yan 1993 Edition)"}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached]Guo Muyue: 'Mourning My Friend Ba hong'\\nOn the evening of August 23, 2006, suddenly received a call from a very rusty little girl: 'I am Ba hong's grandson daughter. My grandfather Ba hong died yesterday (August 22), at 8 a.m.' I was stunned. \\nPrior through Li Luling (Mrs. Ba hong), it was known that Ba hong had Alzheimer's disease and did not recognize people. Both lymphoma and gastric cancer. An 85-year-old man, is about to be wood, inevitably, but did not think, came so fast! My mood is extremely heavy, recalling our 42 years of friendship, wind and rain, together, walked through the second half of my life together. \\nIn 1964, I worked as an accountant in a prison in Beijing (outside Deshengmen), Xindu Warmer Machinery Factory. This position is enviable among plant-wide employment workers, sometimes posing as half a public security cadre. \\nAt the turn of the spring and summer of 1964, I received a dispatch order, to transfer a person into our factory, which reads:\\nName: Ba Hung. \\nOriginal unit: Beijing Film Studio (Director Ren)\\nProblem: Right and counter-revolution. \\nThis name and profession went deep into my mind, and I always wanted to hunt for wonders. So, taking a night shift, I went to the furnace workshop. Indoor fog misty, dust and sand just settled, big plant empty one. But when I turned to the core-making workshop, a medium head, slightly fat, a pair of people with big eyes, sat on a small stool, speechless, as if deliberately shy away from me. He wore a blue overalls and covered with socks. But in such an environment, then handsome 'handsome', also have to reduce the color eight points. My power at the time could question any employed person. Ba hong is no exception. \\n'Are you Ba hong?' \\n'Yes.' \\nI spoke very graceful, and he saw me without malice, and his face relaxed a lot. \\nAnd I said, 'Where did you get it from?' \\n'Mission River Farm.' \\n'How much do you pay?' \\n'41 yuan 5 corner.' \\n...\\nOur conversations are 'official languages' and are within the scope of my position. Actually I was knowingly asked. These content, long ago on the dispatch order. At this time, I took off the 'fake mask' and revealed the true meaning. First of all, I said, 'Old bus, I am also a right-wing, employed person, we are the same, I just want to talk to you... 'I made these confessions, in prison, but made Ba hong very moved. He also does not shy away from speaking. And I asked another question: 'Are you not just a right-wing issue, or a counter-revolution?' \\nThis question, on the contrary, makes Ba hong seem easy. I wonder, and asked, 'What kind of counter-revolution are you?' 'I participated in the Sino-U.S. Cooperation Institute.' Oh yo my mom! The monk of Zangji could not touch his head. But Ba hong said easily: 'I am not afraid, I was appointed by the party, and the appointed person is Du Xuan in Shanghai, only to participate in the Sino-US Cooperation Institute. One group of 12 people, I am the team leader, 11 others are underground parties.' After this conversation, we became friends from strangers, and I was satisfied with my activities. We became friends and later became good friends. \\nIn the early 1940s, Ba hong participated in the new Chinese theatre house under the leadership of the Communist Party. At that time, the conditions were difficult, in order to play, the legs were broken, so far the walk was not very neat. He squats all the prisons in Beijing, but he has never done any work. Because of his past status, he was taken care of by the prison authorities. For example, he spent a long time at the Tuanhe farm, has been braided baskets with right-wing elements Tan Tianrong, baskets are technical work, only Tan Tianrong, baskets help who will, but only choose Ba hong. How many people died of starvation in prisons during that horrible so-called 'three-year disaster' period? Nobody statistics,Ba hong and Tan Tianrong were not starved to death,It is related to their lower labor volume。 \\nAfter years, Ba hong and I lived a 'employmentalist' for five years from 1964 to 1969. The so-called 'employmentals' is an unknown social group. It is a person who has completed their sentence, the persons who have completed their sentences, and those who have completed their re-education through labour, remain in prison and pay some meager wages (e.g. Ba hong is 41.50 yuan, I am 33 yuan for a long time, then 45 yuan). Home can go home, no family concentrated in the prison dormitory, when the wind calm waves nothing, once the wind blows and grass, will be all imprisoned, forbidden to go out. When the whole factory assembly is held, meeting with incarcerated persons and retreats in a machine-gun environment. There are alternative situations: If Japanese come to China, Japanese language is not allowed to go out, English and beautiful people will not be allowed to go out in English. If you run away from oppression, even if you can escape to the corner of the world, you can finally take you to jail. \\nIn the exception of Bahon, he is cared for elsewhere, and according to customary practice, he should live in a prison dormitory where he may be allowed to rent a house. He rented a small room in Xinjiekou small chair circle alley, which also makes it easier for us to move privately. Ba hong is a culinary master and does everything delicious, and I am a guest of his cabin every Sunday. From our long-term interaction, I know that Ba hong is an anhui shouxian people, is the battle of water, bagong mountain, grass and trees are soldiers place. Although Ba hong did not say, I found that he and Li Hongzhang had a guangge. He might not be Li Hongzhang's family, but he was also a sideline. Ba Hong is the stage name. He formerly known as Li Kong Chang, has two sisters, a sister, a brother. Both sisters are married to a wealthy businessman in Southeast Asia. The big sister is wealthier than two sisters. The big sister is a pro-Communist Party sent, and every time he enters Kyoto, it is a reception \\nOne year, she asked Liao Chengzhi to return her huge property in Nanjing. Liao Err did not say, and ordered a trespass. But when she asked for pardon on behalf of her brother's right-wing activist Ba hong, she was refused. In China, mention that the president of Jincheng Bank, financial giant Zhou Youmin, is nobody knows that Ba hong's sister married Zhou's son to his wife. I wonder that Lee's three sisters resemble Song's three sisters, and all married people resonated. \\nBa hong and his wife, Li Luling, gave birth to a man and a woman, and because her sister was not born, Ba hong gave her daughter to her sister. That being said, it seems that their relationship is not very good, and Ba hong rarely mentions when we chatted. Only once, he said with emotion: 'Before liberation I followed the Communist Party's revolution and was born to death, he (referring to his brother-in-law, son of Zhou's people), was eating and drinking in the United States. After liberation he entered the party, I went to jail.' His brother in Wuhan never mentioned it, as if this person did not exist. Because of my age, I do not know about the struggle of the two parties in the former country's liberation on the literary front, but from Ba hongkou, I also know a little bit. The top leadership of the Communist Party is Zhou Enlai. At this level, Ba hong is not enough, but Xia Yan, Tian Han, Pan Hannian, Qu Baiyin, Zhong Yuanqu, Wu Zuguang and so on have exchanges. He was one of the youngest members of this age, and one of the youngest. This is not Ba hong's confession, but from my contacts and talks with him. \\nOnce we talked about Tian Han from Ane, Ba Hongshun took out the 'Tian Han Collection', one of which is 'Tian Han Giving Comrade Ba hong'. So I know that Ba hong and Tian Han have exchanges, how deep they are, I do not know. Ba hong and Xia Yan have a deep relationship. In 1948, Ba hong was appointed by Xia Yan to complete a major event in the history of Chinese Communist Party films. Ba hong was published in the press. The name of the article has been forgotten, but before it was published, I read Ba hong's original manuscript, called 'Upward North and South Sea', which is to describe the matter before and after. Ba hong is not a party member, but he is always enthusiastic and discouraged for the cause of the Communist Party. \\nFirst liberation, he was transferred to the Beijing Film Studio at the Pearl River Film Studio, as Chief of the Performance Section, and director and head of the film actors' troupe. He was an actor and wanted to exercise, he was dissatisfied with these administrative positions, so some complaints. It's not easy until 1956, with him as the director, ready to shoot the military blockbuster 'Leap Sky Risk'. After the fact, Ba hong bragging with me, said that the army had given him the strength of a division at that time. Unfortunately, the doom of 1957 came, and the film was not shot, but it was divided into the right. According to Ba hong, he was an actor for the actors' troupe fate and treatment, and was classified as far right. In the early 1980s, a chance I discovered an old painting newspaper of 1957 North Shadow, which reported that North Shadow pulled out a group of right-wing elements: Li Jingbo, Ba hong, etc., so I happily ran to the North Film and gave the pictorial to Ba hong. Old bus sentiments. After he returned to the North, he knew that one of the most serious people who exposed him was one of his best friends, he was angry and asked to see the file. Personnel authorities exhorted: 'You don't look, look angry, and the files on the right have been destroyed and you can't see it.' Ba hong fussed. \\nAfter the day of killing in the Cultural Revolution on August 18, 1966, I escaped from the whip of the Red Guard. One Saturday night, I became a guest in the 'Little Chair Circle' in Pahon House. At this time, a new member was added to the hut, is the son of Ba hong from the northeast, Xiao Hung (Li Daoming). He is a high school student, beautiful than his dad, graceful and flourishing. Ba hong saw me here, very happy to say: 'I went to Xinjiekou to buy some food, we wish a little bit!' After that, it went out. I talked to Xiaohong and knew that Xiaohong was holding the radio to learn English, had reached a very high level, and asked me to give him the abbreviation 'Song of Youth', he wanted to translate. I laughed and answered, 'I don't have this skill.' \\nHe was familiar with Xiaohong, he stare two big eyes, mysteriously told me one thing. Yesterday he read a book in Wangfujing outside the instrument store, came in a foreigner, looking for a book, waiters up and down to ask is not found, buyers and sellers are very anxious. At this time, Xiao Hongshun hand found the book on the bookshelf and handed it to foreigners. Foreigners were delighted, talking in English and Xiaohong, talking very speculative. Foreigners had a private car, asked Xiaohong on the car. Xiaohong was young, I didn't know the depth (at the time this was Litong foreign ah), or got on the car. Foreigners introduce themselves: He is Sri Lanka's former ambassador to China. He then rose to Foreign Minister and now leaves his post. He travels around the world and is now a Chinese station and asked about Xiaohong. Xiaohong said his parents were artists, but did not say that his father was in prison, that he was a secondary school student, nor told him that he was waiting for classes at home. The former foreign minister praised Xiaohong's foreign-language proficiency and said that he must write Xiaohong when writing books. At this time, the car drove to the door of a large hotel, and the restaurant closes from six o'clock at that time, but foreigners reported themselves, the restaurant opened the door and welcomed guests outside one of China and one. When eating, this foreigner will not use chopsticks and grab food by hand, so that Xiao Hong is not twisted, after eating, foreigners pulled Xiao Hong to the Telegraph building, at this time, there were reception staff who asked Xiaohong what it was doing, scared Xiaohong and ran away. \\n'Don't tell my dad!' Xiaohong said. \\n'This is so dangerous, isn't you looking for your dad's cemetery...' I warned him. \\nAt this time, Ba hong came back, carrying two pounds of chicken legs, seemed very excited, said: 'I met Xie Tian at the Xinjiekou. He blushes and swells, he is fighting at the Institute of Socialism. Ba hong said to Xie Tim with pleasure, 'I live nearby, please you eat chicken legs?' Xie Tian walked with a smile. At this time, Ba hong appeared to mourn again. Say a sentence: 'Hide the first one, can not hide 15 ah!' \\nI and Ba hong father and son ate a delicious chicken leg, but they were not interested, because the future of the three people are lost, no way to go, the face is inexhaustible, bottomless darkness of the abyss. Ba hong's hut, the lights are not too bright. Then he stood up slowly and pulled out a small book from his pocket. I don't know what it is, much less what he wants to do. Suddenly Ba hong tear it into a strip, finally torn crushed, thrown on the ground. 'Old bus, what did you tear?' I asked. 'Theatre Association membership card.' Because of the old bus road encounter Tim, which caused his skin pain, he was 'Lin Dai jade manuscript broken love' ah! Everything is desperate. \\nI was with Ba hong for five years in Xindu, and he never talked about politics and current situations. In the autumn of 1969, Lin Biao issued Decree No. 1. The first manifestation of the prison was that all foreign employed persons from all provinces and municipalities were repatriated to their places of origin, Ba hong for a period of 12 years and repatriated to Changsha, Hunan province. Ba hong was homeless in Shouxian County, Anhui and repatriated to Tongling Prison in Anhui Province. Ba hong left Beijing, sold three guys four, only one casserole left, gave me. At this time I have felt that the myth of Lin Biao Mao Zedong has reached a strange level. I think I all felt that the savvy as Mao Zedong would not be unaware. When I sent Ba hong away from Beijing to Anhui, on the train, I revealed my mind to Ba hong, and said in his ear: 'The last fight for the Cultural Revolution was not Mao, Liu, but Mao and Lin.' When I looked at Ba hong, one of his smiley eyes did not smile and frightened his face. This was worth a bullet at that time, let alone from the mouth of a right-wing element. I used this to send Ba hong to the south train. \\nAt the end of November of that year, the Xindu labour camp sent us to the Hebei rural squad, the first load was nine years. Since then, I and Ba hong have since separated the two places, each suffering the years. Recall that in the late spring of 1975, I met with Ba hong and I met at Gulou Street in Beijing for six years, but it seems that neither side has changed much. I told him he might want to get married, and he didn't take care of me. We walked 20 meters, and he turned around and asked me, 'I'm getting divorced, you get married, huh!' 'It seems to be God's arrangement.' I answer. He always remained silent. \\nAlthough Ba hong is paid 20 yuan a month, he is always endless because he has a wide sister. He asked me, 'What do you want to eat?' 'I want to eat lamb shabu.' Coincidentally we went to Shicha beach, not far from the 'roast season', we went into this shop hall. Ba hong is an Anhui and is not interested in shabu-shabu lamb. The shop hall sits scattered diners, all face obscure, no angry. This is the ninth year of the Cultural Revolution, where death is dead and alive without much energy. At this time, the waiter we want to two pounds shabu meat end, fuchsia, very ugly, it is not fresh at all. I asked the waiter, the waiter is an old comrade, cried and said: 'Comrade, you forgive! Your two pounds of meat is the meat of a whole sheep. I am vices that do not change the following words: 'This sheep is tired of the Cultural Revolution, not even the meat is long.' The waiter laughed, Ba Hung stare at me. I drank two or two liquors. Even though the lamb was poor, it was good to eat meat in that year. \\nBa hong was not home in Beijing, although he had relatives, it was not appropriate to stay in his capacity, so he went back to my eight-square-meter cottage and slept together. Ba hong is ready to stay in Beijing for ten days, then go to Shenyang to visit his family. My eldest sister and my same hospital, two nephew daughters, were glad not to go up to the mountains and the countryside, and they both stayed at the Beijing factory. They were just fancy, and they met Ba hong all kind called 'Babber', and Ba Hung happily took two Hong Kong shirts to them. Hong Kong has a new style of clothing, and the two children are very happy. \\nThe next day, Tongbahong went to the 'Senlong Hotel' at the North Gate of Dongan Market and had lunch. This shop was originally my classmate Zhang Lida father, Tao Xiangchun old store Zhang Senlong open, is a Huaiyang Pavilion, sweet taste, suitable for Ba hong taste, but not for my taste. It was so hard for me to swallow for seven days. I made an answer to Ba hong, man, spare me! I can't stand it, can't we change the place?' Ba hong asked: 'What do you want to eat?' 'Let's go to Dongsi tomorrow to eat fried pimples.' Ba hong laughed. The next day, we ate fried pimples, I was swallowed, Ba hong ate half a plate left half a plate. \\nAfter Beijing, we are running to tomorrow. After correction, Ba hong returned to the North Shadow, I returned to the bank. He has been 60 years old and has been away from his director for twenty years, but he and Wang Wang guided the powerful drama 'Sunrise', and Xie Tie-li and Chen Huaikai led the film 'Insights', and also self-directed the film 'Under the Poplar Tree'. After that, due to the age of age, he retreated on the film scene. Back in Beijing, I met Mrs. Li Luling, Mrs. Li Luling, who had been suffering with Ba hong for 20 years, and met with adults, their beloved son Xiaohong (Li Daoming), and we felt great emotions for the rest of my life. \\nAfter the right, an incident that shakes the intellectual world-the death of the famous singer Mo Guixin, makes people of conscience dim grief. He was imprisoned in February 1958, died in August, and was sadly appointed to Huangquan in just half a year, under the age of 40. When people did not know how he died, that is, his beloved woman singer Zhang Quan and his children did not know, and became a mystery. \\nMy friend Yan Gong talked to me about this, reminding me of Ba hong. He knew the mystery of this matter. Yan Gong was happy. He ordered me to take a recorder, and about the death of Mo Guixin, please talk about the whole process, and record it. I said there is no need, I can call Ba hong to write it down directly. So, talking to Ba hong on the phone, he was happy and said: 'My little brother, Wang Hongtao, who knows more detail than me, we can write it together.' Therefore, the article 'The Death of Mo Guixin Two' was published in the 9th issue of the Chinese Cultural World in 1997. The article is extremely heavy, though short. It tells the world, told Mo Guixin's children (at this time Ms. Zhang Quan died), how singer Mo Guixin was devastated and killed. After death, it smells off the intestine. A cultural insidor said to me, 'This article is very good to reveal what people don't know about.' \\nHere I tell a legend, is also the brightest highlight of his life. \\nA year, month and day after the 80s, Ba hong and Li Luling visited their friends, comrades and senior senior Mr. Xia Yan's apartment together. They haven't seen for nearly 50 years, but both sides were impressed, so they met with great excitement. When shaking hands, remember 50 years of wind and rain warehouse emperor, Xia Gong hot tears, Ba Hong sadly sadly, when talking about the story of 'North and South Sea upward', Ba hong asked: 'I am a party person, why do you trust me so much?' Xia Gong said: 'I understand you, people do not doubt, no doubt.' And firmly said: 'At the same time, I don't have to be wrong!' The two sides were very happy to talk. Finally Ba hong asked for a group photo with Xia Gong, Xia Gong happily said: 'Let's go to the living room to photograph.' When Xia Yan stood up and walked, he had become a disabled person. Ba hong did not understand, wanted to open his mouth and asked, Li Luling ruthlessly tampered with Ba Hong. After knowledge Xia Yan in the 'Cultural Revolution', he was injured and disabled by the Red Guard, and the treatment was not timely, only to achieve such a result. Their group photo I saw in Ba hong's house, Ba hong told me: 'After Xia Yan died, firmly not into the Baoshan Revolution Cemetery, Xia Yan learned.' \\nRegarding the 'North and South Sea Upward', I look at the original Ba hong manuscript. Newspaper publication is not the name, the old memory is not clear, and the general summary is Ba hong's oral narrative. \\nThe Battle of Liao Shen in 1948 has completely ended, and the Northeast has been completely liberated. As Xia Yan, who is responsible for propaganda work in Hong Kong, how to fight and how to win the Northeast war, there is no information in his hands, how to spread the influence to Southeast Asian countries has become a problem that must be solved, but difficult to solve. Go inland, the battle of Huaihai has not yet been completely over. Pingjin is still in the hands of the KMT, and it is extremely difficult to obtain information. At that time, Ba hong's brother-in-law and older sister, were already Southeast Asian capitalists (but Ba hong never told me their names), and had trade with the Communist Party more than once. After the liberation of the Northeast, the Northeast can only produce white five blobs, but there is no dye, and all Northeastern people wear white. That's not a piety? What kind of whole! At that time, the Communist Party and Ba hong brother-in-law reached an agreement to provide dyes by Ba hong's brother-in-law and walked the waterway, and shipped by Hong Kong to \\nXia Yan has fully grasped the situation, believing that the time has not come and that the use of cargo ships to transport promotional materials is the best option. The only candidate for this task is Ba hong. But Ba hong is not a member of the Party. Can you give it a heavy duty? Xia Yan immediately went to Ba hong to talk to Ba hong, put the situation out and affirm his intention: 'This is the task that the Party has given you, can you complete it?' At this time, Ba hong heart also has the bottom, the boat is his brother-in-law, complete the task is very confident, he felt heavy burden, but no glory. Xia Yan was given the heavy duty, Ba Hung was pleased to be appointed. Xia Yan then sent information to the Northeast Liberation Zone through relevant parties. I only remember that there are Liu Lanbo, secretary of the Dandong Provincial Committee, Yuan Muzhi and Chen Boer, head of Northeast literature and art circles. \\nThe situation at that time was that the Kuomintang had all defeated in mainland China, and the Communist Party victory was in sight, but the KMT still had a navy at sea, although centrifuged from Germany, control remained in his hands. The boat in Ba hong was not insured and was not safe. The big capitalist was willing to take risks for high profits. \\nBa hong took on the letter of introduction, boarded the ship and began to go north. The ship did not dare sail during the day, afraid of KMT intercepting and searching. It can only secretly go north at night. The itinerary is very slow, having encountered a typhoon and also met KMT inspection. The Kuomintang is not an arms, but dye, and the regime is in danger, and it will not ask in detail. With a single eye and a close eye, Ba hong's brother-in-law, only knowing that Ba hong was the Communist Party, he was bombed to the bottom of the ship with a little movement. After many nights, it had gone through a lot of hard work, and the boat finally arrived in Dandong. Ba hong hand contact map, found the first secretary of Dandong Liu Lanbo, Liu clenched Ba hong's hand, the first sentence is: 'How did you arrive at this time?' Ba hong said: 'The things encountered on the road are difficult to estimate, this is no longer slow.' Both sides were very pleased that Liu She feast entertained Ba hong. Strangely enough, there is only one person accompanying the guest, is Liu Lanbo's lady. What makes Ba hong unimagined: according to the standard, Liu Lanbo eats a small stove, and the lady eats the stove, therefore, two kinds of meals on a table. Of course, guests Ba hong are eaten small stoves. At that time, Ba hong told me about this little thing, and I came up with an idea: first, the Communist Party was really honest and honest and admirable. Second, such a hierarchy, Liu Lanbo, with his wife, could not enter the door of heaven. This marks my heart. \\nAfter Liu Lanbo's guidance, Ba hong met Yuan Muzhi and Chen Boer, met with great joy. At that time, Ba hong was only 26 years old, Shi disciples, self-occupied with their younger generations. At that time, Yuan and Chen were senior leaders of film and literary circles, and they could afford it. They build a good relationship. When liberated, Ba hong was in the Pearl River Film Studio, Chen Boer moved Ba hong and his wife to the North Film themselves. \\nBa hong Fengxia Yan ordered to liberate film materials mainly to Yuan and Chen Yao Northeast. This is the Party's task. Yuan and Chen are actively organizing, with a large number of five or six boxes. Yuan said with emotion: 'The PLA, the Communist Party is preferential to prisoners, but the Kuomintang is too many prisoners, and the Communist Party can't afford it.' In short, complete the task, ready to go. \\nEverything is ready, only owe the Dongfeng, but the ship can not set sail, Ba hong anxious. Originally, both supply and demand could not settle in currency, but only barter, and the supply side offered to pay the big smoke, which could hardly hurt the Communist Party authorities of the Northeast. It cannot take the lead, but can only ask the Party Central Committee of Xipo. This has delayed the time. Finally, the Party Central Committee instructed that only soybeans can be used as an exchange condition, and the two sides reach an agreement. After sailing, Ba hong put the film box on the ship. He was an empty pedestrian in the north, and he took so many things south, and it was a prohibited item of the KMT. Finally arrived in Hong Kong. These films, which cannot be docked, moved off from the ship and hired small boats to disembark before arriving at the Hong Kong port. Xia Yan received the film, that night, it started editing. \\nThis is Ba hong's biggest contribution to the Communist Party and the greatest highlight of his life, just by memory, record as above, to accuse my friend's spirit of heaven. \\nPAGE 7"}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached]Fujian Provincial Public Security Department: 'Report on the Circulation of Wind Movement (No. 5), 1957.6.29'\\nAfter a telephone conference was held by the Central Committee, our hall held an emergency party group expansion meeting on the evening of June 21, attended by party group members, directors and deputy directors, and full-time staff drawn in the wind, conveying the spirit of the provincial committee's instructions, and also appointed more than 300 party members to listen to the reports of the mobilization of Secretary Ye and Jiang respectively. We also mobilized the members of the Communist Youth League, and the party members unanimously recognized the current Class struggles are still raging, and it is necessary to strengthen unity, stand firm and demarcate the line between right-wing elements and resolutely defeating the rampant attacks by right-wing elements. This has led to a massive mass anti-right struggle movement, which has been extremely active over the days, such as large print newspapers, cartoons, rebuttal articles, wall papers, etc., and held a whole hall 'meeting against the right' on the evening of the 25th, resulting in a powerful public opinion offensive, forcing the right forces to become increasingly polarized and isolated. Ground, making the right inside the constant uprising. Further reports revealed their insider information, and several key cases are reported as follows:\\nFirst, by queuing reactionary rhetoric and illegal acts, to determine the focus of the attack and the target. According to the reactionary remarks revealed by the whole hall, (summed up into six categories: (1), negating the need for internal rebellion; (2), overthrowing the party leadership, digging three roots, demanding the withdrawal of the party member's support committee within the Communist Youth League, even saying that the Party member's branch was sent agents; (3), defamation under the socialist system did not Freedom, democracy, public security office terror, cruelty and ruthless; (4), distort the party's intellectual-policy, saying that the logic of leadership is : Intellectual+often give opinions to leaders = suspicion of counter-revolutionary; (5), attacking political organs, distorting cadre policy, saying that the Political Ministry has sectarianism, and that the conditions for the promotion of cadres are to see that 'they will be met, willing to be slaves, have a relationship', and call for the restructuring or abolition of the Political Ministry; (6), Negation of being within the Church The Ministry is engaged in anti-struggle, etc.), and illegal activities, together with specific people, in full queues. According to their existence of serious bourgeoisie ideology, with consistent dissatisfaction or even opposition to the organization, reactionary words and deeds in the movement, linked to the history of origin, initially classified as the right, 28 people (including the middle right), took separate treatment in order to achieve the goal of struggle and polarization. Determine:\\n1, a wide range of names including leaders named 6 people, including: (omitted)\\n2, the whole hall by the masses named 10 people, including: (omitted)\\n3, the whole hall does not name, but must reveal its reactionary words and deeds, or by the unit nomination criticism of 12 people, including: (omitted)\\nWhen we announced at the anti-counter colloquium that the first group of six were asked to account further, others believed that the leadership had not yet treated me as a right-wing. Therefore, some such as Belshengkai and Tang Tengji said after the meeting, they must draw the line with right-wing elements, actively and resolutely fight against the right, thus playing a polarization role. \\nSecond, to fight for the middle and intifada. The middle molecules were also queued up in the backbone, with the middle right (slightly), and 11 others. Exchanging views on individual conversations and interpreting their opinions, educating ambiguities in order to communicate ideas and focus on further situational education to inspire awareness; some particularly right-wing elements of the second or third categories of right-wing groups will come through party groups To educate, properly criticize incorrect ideas and give direction; also use anti-counter symposia with the purpose of targeting certain Rightists named the masses to provoke, giving appropriate pressure. After all aspects of work, so some quickly realized, such as high heart, Chen Li middle, after education, revealed a lot of insider material in the anti-counter colloquium, causing the right to shake inside. The centrist Guan Chunsheng and others have also changed significantly, actively writing rebuttal articles, writing large print newspapers, and participated in the struggle. \\nThird, still taking anti-counter symposia as the main battlefield, adopt internal and external clamping, using the method of picking, grabbing and fighting further problems, and cracking down heavily on right-wing elements. Originally, we have very little knowledge of the specific materials of Luyi, the right-wing member. He also thinks there is no reactionary rhetoric, there is no handle on the leadership, and someone said to him that you should also review it. He said, 'I review a fart!' The flame is high. As a result of their internal uprising, they exposed a series of reactionary ideas about leading elements such as Lu Yi, and organizing activities before and after the symposium, as well as materials that had links with Peking University and provincial medical schools, forcing them to bow down and admit some facts. He also seized Zhao Min, who gave an account of the Peking University's attempt to ignition and participate in Lu Yi activities at the Public Security Department. In order to cooperate with the fight within the conference and set off the mass movement of anti-right struggle, in addition to the Party and the regiment mobilization education, continued to publish the minutes of the meeting speeches in a timely manner in the wall press, organized comrades participating in the meeting and communicating separately to the cadres of the conference, highlighting their reactionary words and deeds, and led organizations to talk to them, thus inspiring them. Fighting spirit, all writing walls refuted those reactionary fallacies, and posted cartoons, all sorts of large print newspapers, indicating that The resolutely struggles of right-wing elements and calling for the convening of a 'meeting against the right' have created strong momentum. In particular, more than 20 comrades spoke at the conference and expressed their determination, demonstrating the power of the masses, not only educating the right, but also educating the masses, and more conducive to fighting for the middle and dividing the right. As a result, some who had links with the right, such as Lin Zhangfu, automatically revealed some of Lu Yi's activities, generally expressed the intention to draw the line with the right-wing elements. At present, the market for right-wing activities has narrowed and increasingly isolated, and some are preparing to account for further problems. However, Lu Yi, Tanping, and Zhuang Biren from the far right have also shared some problems, but they are not honest. They have called some activities as 'coincidences'. They are generally not malice and so on. Tan Ping even attempted to divert the goal of the struggle, claiming that some problems, Zhao Min and so on, they know that they still pretend to pursue some issues, as a way to divert sight. \\nIn the light of current developments, we believe that the extreme right has not surrendered and that it remains an arduous process of struggle for complete victory. On the basis of the existing victory, further work for disintegration, and further launch the masses, continue to use the colloquium as the battlefield, win the pursuit, and initially dig out their roots, that is, to move into the whole hall and conduct a comprehensive and systematic rebuttal and criticism, until they completely disarm, completely stink, and the right. All isolated so far."}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached]Yang Ning: 'Pei Ni-ming Masters Family Members Suffering' (2017.6.18)\\nWhen it comes to Pei, many people think of the glass pyramid in front of the Louvre Museum in France, which is the designer of this famous modernist architecture. In addition, China Bank Building in Hong Kong, MIHU Art Museum of Japan, Dallas City Hall, Dongxiang Museum in Washington, and the church of Donghai University in Taiwan are also representative works of Pei Yiming. As a result, he won numerous awards. And this year's 100-year-old Pei Yiming can do so in his life, stemmed from a decision of that year. \\nBorn famous people\\nIn 2001, Pei wrote to Xu Kuangdi, the then mayor of Shanghai, asking for the retention of the old house that his family lived for many years, but was not valued, and the old house was quickly demolished. This 'mansion' was bought in 1911 by Beilun, known as the 'Shanghai pigment king'. \\nSpeaking of the Bei family, it was a famous surname in Suzhou, but he was known. According to the biography of Pei Yumin, the Bei clan came to Suzhou in the midst of the war at the end of the Yuan Yuan. They started by selling medicine, and in the years of Qianlong, Beth had become one of the four rich in Suzhou. Baccarat is also famous. 300 meters from the Suzhou Museum, is Suzhou's most famous garden lion forest, is also the old residence of Bei's family. It is said that the Qing dynasty likes to play Emperor Qianlong every time under Jiangnan, must live in the lion forest. \\nPei's grandfather, Bei Zaian, was the 13th grandson of Bejia and was a former student in Suzhou Province. After the sudden death of his father, he turned to the father's business. In 1915, Bai Zaian participated in the founding of the Bank of Shanghai. He also helped create China Travel Agency, the first new travel agency in China, and later set up a branch in Suzhou as manager. Bezaian gave birth to five sons, all working in the banking industry, and his three son Bezuye, was Pei's father. \\nAfter graduating from Dongwu University, Beizu Yee married Zhuang's daughter, the last of the Qing Dynasty, the daughter of the Qing Dynasty, gave birth to three men and three women, and the eldest son was Pei Pei Yiming died at the age of 13, and Beizu married Jiang Shiyun, a 21-year-old Jiangnan celebrity who met in Europe. Two love to the old. \\nIn addition to Bei Zaian this thriving development, there are also Pei Yi Ming Zubeirun this one also developed very well. Bei Zaian is known as the 'financial family', and Berunsheng is called the 'pigment king' because he is a man who sells pigments. \\nBeilun Sheng's biggest contribution is to buy Suzhou's lion forest, and has invested 800,000 Yuan, which took 7 years to repair it. The television documentary 'Chinese in the World' has an episode dedicated to Pei Yuming, and a large part of the film is his own garden memories of that year: 'The lion forest was our bailhouse. So when I was a kid, I always went back to Suzhou in the lion forest in the summer. At that time there were not many people, very few people went in, was a private park, our home courtyard is famous for stone, these stone shapes are very peculiar, there are many holes with lots of blemishes, and it seems half of life is a stone.' \\nThese stones with life turned out to be beilun shen first to craftsmen in accordance with the stone form, chisel the hole, and then put into the water, with the flowing water washed, so infiltrated the last year and a half load of the stone, it became round and angry. \\nAfter studying in the United States, prevented by his father and not returning home\\nBorn in 1917, Pei Zouyi moved to Hong Kong in 1918 to escape the war and set up the Hong Kong branch of Bank of China and served as general manager. Pei spent his childhood in Hong Kong. In 1927, Bezouyi became the manager of the Shanghai branch of Bank of China, and a family moved to Shanghai, where Pei Yiming studied secondary school. He returns to Suzhou's Lion Forest every summer, and this experience has influenced Pai's design philosophy: 'Man and Nature', 'The True Meaning of Family: Cohesion and History.' \\nIn 1935, 18-year-old Pei went to the United States to study architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, and then transferred to MIT for a bachelor's degree in architecture. Master of Architecture from Harvard University in 1946. At that time, his father, Bezouyi, was trusted by Song Zi-wen to President of the Central Bank of Nanjing National Government. In February 1947, he was instructed to open up the foreign exchange and gold market, which triggered a gold wave and resigned, accused of impeachment by the Inspectorate. Managing Director of Bank of China in August 1947. \\nAfter the Communist Party of China was established in 1949, Pei Yiming wanted to return to work, but Bezouyi stopped him. Perhaps Bezoo's heart is clear what the CCP is. He also moved overseas and served as vice chairman of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Commercial Bank in 1959. \\nThis wise decision of Bezoum has escaped the Chinese Communist Party persecution and laid the foundation for Pei's eventual masters, while none of the other members of the mainland survived bad luck. \\nPei, who stayed in the United States, became a citizen of the United States in 1954 and worked in the company after graduating from Harvard and began his career in architectural design until he became a master. \\nThe doom of other members of the beihouse\\nAccording to the network's signature 'Sea Side', 'The only family in China over 15 generations, rely on what heritage?' An article introduces that after the Chinese Communist Party of China, the Bei family who stayed in the mainland has 'knowledge of the current affairs' handed over most of the property, such as the management rights of banks, electricity, fuel and dyes. Two houses have also handed over, one is the beijia garden house at 170 Nanyang Road, Shanghai French Concession, and one is the lion forest \\nNevertheless, the family has not escaped doom. Pei Yuming's brother, Bei Zhongwei, was sentenced to 22 years for the right, and assigned to Heilongjiang labour education. Sister Pei Lynn managed to get some sugar to send him. Later, he told everyone that he would have committed suicide without this sugar. \\nPey's banker's husband is a 'historical counter-revolution' despite falling his salary, and every time he participates in the fight, Pei said to her husband, a demand not to die. His son-in-law Leung Chengjin recalled that once he came home from the critics, the children saw him hanging a big sign, and they took him off, and the wire on the plate pulled him out of the dark purple mark. Everyone is very sad, for a moment I don't know what to say, he himself 'bent over from the basket of dishes picked a few cabbage with a yellow flower core, and smoothly pick a bottle from the ground, plug it up to the table a swing', he said: flowers have spring, flowers will have hope! \\nPei Yiming's Gu Beijuan Lin married Wu Tongwen, who was also a pigment tycoon. The couple's subsequent encounters were also astonishing. At that time, Bei Juanlin's dowry was a piece of land in Shanghai, where Wu Tongwen asked people to build a mansion, a 'green house' later known as the 'first mansion in the Far East'. During the Cultural Revolution, after Wu Tongwen was criticized, together with her aunt, took his hands in the green house poison, Bei Juanlin was also sweeped out. After the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese Communist Party government intended to return the green house to Bei Juanlin, but she refused: 'No, even if it comes back, you can't get back the style of that year.' \\nEye-Ming's Happiness\\nAfter studying in the United States in 1974, Pei came home in Suzhou for the first time. He was confronted with 'more than 100 relatives dressed in dilapidated blue and black clothes', and could not speak for a time. Later Pei said to colleagues, 'I don't have a slightest sense of superiority in front of them. Any one of them can be me, I can be any one of them, everything is an accident of history.' \\nHowever, there is inevitable in this accident. Because Pei Yuming's father, Bezouyi, has a certain understanding of the CCP, so not only did he have a good end, but also let his son escape the suffering, and made the next generation of Bejia have a good development: three of Pei's four children graduated from Harvard University and worked in architecture, daughters Studying law at Columbia University is excellent. And the next generation of Bei's family, if leaving the mainland, may also have a brilliant life."}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached]Honraku Master: 'My Study Experience at Wuchang Buddhist College (Excerpt)'\\nHuang Pei is the first student after the restoration of Wuchang Buddhist College after the war of resistance. He reviewed in detail his experience at Wuchang Buddha College and revealed some lesser known past events about Wuchang Buddha College after the war of resistance:\\nI was born in June 1918, a fraudster and farmer's family in Liu Village, Gantang Township, Huangpi County, Hubei Province. After the death of my parents, three of our brothers were very lonely, I was still studying elementary school, influenced by the monks in the temple, came to Houn Temple to go home. I was taken up as an apprentice, and gave me peace of mind. That was 1933, I was 15 years old. In 1936, I was in Guiyuan Zen Temple by the three big ring, after the period was complete, lived in Baotong Zen Temple, practicing Zen Law for 4 years. Wuhan fell during the War of Anti-Japanese War. When the KMT retreated, I originally wanted to follow to Chongqing, but my master called me back to Enji Temple. Because I stayed in Guiyuan Temple and Baotong Temple for a few years, the Dharma of Buddhism has basically learned very well, master thinks I can be home. So in 1941, at the request of Master and Baoen Temple Master Wan Xiajin (Chairman of Hubei Provincial Government Wan Yao-huang), and the ten parties, I was honored as the Abbot of Baoen Temple. In the winter of 1944, under the support of Wan Tai Au, I asked Guiyuan Temple, Baotong Temple, Putu Temple, the large jungle of more than 50 high monks, on the one hand held the interests of the kingdom of water and land law, facilities flames, wide practices, ultra fighters, on the one hand, open the altar, under the ring of more than 270 disciples. The whole law lasted 49 days, outside the temple shells rumble, bullet rain, the temple clean and solemn, orderly, a time Baun Temple reputation magnified. \\nToo virtual master (1899-1947), is a modern monk, Zhejiang Chongde, at the age of 16 into Suzhou Xiaojiuhua Temple shaved monk, after home to Ningbo Tiantong Temple in Zen monk with foot ring. In 1922, too virtual master founded Wuchang Buddhist College, cultivated a group of virtues and sangha talents. At that time, Buddhist College used the villa of Uncle Li Yuanhong, the house was very good, was a mansion. Now Wuchang Buddha College site is in Wuchang Qianjia Street 701 Design Institute living district, where there is also too virtual master Shelita and his former residence 'chocky'. \\nAfter the fall of Wuhan, Wuchang Buddha College was occupied by the Japanese and converted into stables. After the victory in 1945, too virtual master sent disciples reed master to restore Wuchang Buddha College. He saw me in Hankou Buddhist Zhengxin Association. I felt that I was very young and a little cultural. I wanted to receive my study at Wuchang Buddhist College. Because I am a rural child, although I was a family in Houn Temple for several years, I still felt that the cultural level was too low. When a monk was poor, I also hoped to learn more about Dharma, so I handed over to a division and uncle. This division was a farmer's origin. Later when the land reform ran, the Baoen Temple was inhabited by Xinzhou County Food Control Station. From then on, Hoon-ji Temple disappeared in Kurabu. \\nIn April 1946, Wuchang Buddhist College opened. I read ordinary Buddhist classes, teacher from Inshun Mage. In 1947, I was sent to Chongqing Beibei Han Tibetan Teaching Institute to study intermediate Buddhist classes. I wanted to learn Tibetan language and go to Tibet in the future. In January 1949, it was heard that Wuhan was going to liberate, the leading mages of the Wuchang Buddhist College had all run, the master of Inshun went to Hong Kong, and some teachers from the Han Tibetan Academy went to Putuo Mountain and some went to Singapore. The students who did not leave until the Spring Festival in 1949 had only 21 people left, and the 21 people had no one to support their lives. \\nWhen Wuchang Buddhist College was founded there are three institutions: Wuchang Buddhist College, World Buddhist College Library, Nobita Elementary School. By 1949, when the Buddhist Church invited me back, Buddhist school was suspended, the library was closed, there were only Nobita Elementary School, there were 19 classes, 3 night classes, all surrounding farmers The children are attending, and they ask not to suspend classes. What about this? The 21 students we stayed in Nobita Elementary School were barely maintained. On May 16, on the day of the liberation of Wuhan, I also welcomed the PLA into the city with 5,600 students in Wuchang Gulou Cave. After liberation, Wuchang District set up cultural and education and education. The chief of section was Shandong, called Li Weiren. He found our school and asked how many more people? I told him there were 19 classes, 3 night classes, but there were no teachers. He said that you can't stop classes. You have so many mages and culture. You all go to teach, each one takes a class, and what you can teach, and send 30 yuan per person per month, including living expenses and office expenses. \\nBecause I had a good relationship with the Buddhist Association at that time, I knew many people, my students recommended me as the principal of Nobita Elementary School, saying that I was the principal and they had meals. In 1950, I became the Acting Principal of Nobita Elementary School, leaving the students who stayed in charge of one class. Then the government authorized us to recruit staff and slowly enter some new teachers, so we continued Nobita Elementary School. By April 1952, the Government requested private primary schools throughout the city, including religious institutions, to be converted into public primary schools. \\nIn 1953, the school site was expropriated for the establishment of artillery school, and the government moved Nobita Elementary School to a new school building and changed its name to Shouyi Road Primary School. By 1954, after having been a principal there for more than a year, I came to a youth group to pick me up, and I changed to the first teaching director. On the right, I was beaten as the right, and after three years of transformation in Dongxi Lake, I went to Minglun Street Primary School in Wuchang District. After reinstating religious policies throughout the country, I moved to Sandaojie Primary School in Wuchang District and resumed my position as teaching director until retirement. \\nIn 1993, Changmingda monk invited me back to Baotong Temple to participate in the restoration of Wuchang Buddhist College, funded by Baotong Temple, Guiyuan Temple and City Buddhist Association each year, a total of 150,000. On April 1, 1994, Buddhist College officially opened its school and held a regular class in Picchu, where young monks from Guiyuan Temple and Baotong Temple studied. After some time, another class was opened at Lianxi Temple. \\nIn 1998, I was invited by Zhang Yuanfa, Cangbu Town, Xinzhou County, the United War cadre, to return to the warehouse to restore, rebuild the ancestor Baoen Temple, and I was the He left Wuchang Buddhist College."}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached]'Jiangxi Daily': 'Nanchang Division's Constant Criticism and Overcome the Right Affiliation of the Humanist Party' (1957.9.21), (1957.9.21)\\n[This news] After constantly criticizing and overcoming the sympathy and pushing the anti-right struggle into depth, Nanchang Teachers College recently revealed a party right-wing activist, head of the office of the principal, Ben Xiangyu. This bourgeois political ambition is a mentor of the bourgeois right in the party. It is a handful of instructors and supporters of the school's right-wing offensive against the party, and an active 'fighter'. \\nDuring the Daming magnification, Ben Xiangyu often discussed with the right elements of the teachers: 'This release will be concluded by Zhang Bojun in the future, because he is the head of the democratic party.' He strongly agreed that some right-wing elements appearing in Wen Wei Po and the Guangming Daily criticized that 'outside the party have no authority', saying 'the party is somewhat organized'; what to say, 'Long live two, in fact, is to sing against the platform, and it is not good for the Communist Party to sing solo feet'. Even rumors said that 'the abolition of the party committee system in higher education was proposed by Chairman Mao'. \\nBen Tianyu is committed to supporting and sponsoring the establishment of a 'whole school committee to create chaos'. When the right-wing elements of the students sweeted the opportunity, they tried to kick off the school party committee and the original student union and class cadre organization leadership, demanded suspension of classes, and set up a school-wide sweeping committee. 'Although a different school is not established, we can also set up, if we can solve the problem quickly. And it is also creating experience.' He immediately turned to positive support for this instruction by right-wing elements Wan Defoo at the student representative meeting, saying, 'I can make this opinion on the school board in the name of the school commissioner.' In order to achieve this goal, he used to intimidate at the extended meeting of the school party committee, saying: 'It is actually two mistakes. Simply stop classes for a few days to make them sing. I think it is a good phenomenon for students to ask for leadership and seek leadership. It should be 'driven by snob'. It is not possible to allow establishment.' Party committee secretary pointed out that this is not a blessing, but the right-wing students are in trouble and can't agree to this request. He is very dissatisfied with the students, and said, 'Everyone is so excited, and I'm afraid it will not be possible to solve the problem without setting up a nudge committee.' Then, with his agreement, the former Student Union Executive Board was expanded by disguised means, proposing two 'representatives' (all leading), to participate in each class, in order to capture the leadership and call on students to trouble. \\nBen Yang gave the right the direction of the attack when the right-wing activists lifted up to the party. He praised Zhu Anping's 'bold' among more than 30 right-wing students, encouraging them to attack the provincial committee. He said: 'Zhu Anping proposed accounting to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou, and also let the old monk taste taste.' 'I tasted enough of the smell of you, but also called the old monk to taste.' At the meeting of representatives convened by students, some people litigated the teacher as a 'product of the subjectivity of the provincial committee'. At the meeting, the right-wing member Liao Guozhen cried to put the big print newspaper to the provincial committee and the Department of Education. 'You focus on the main problems, some big problems can be solved by the Provincial Committee.' 'You look for the little monk to account, and open fire on the old monk.' And introduced the school leadership system 'There are three heads, the Central Ministry of Education, to write to the central government can be sent directly to it. The Ministry of Culture and Education of the Provincial Committee is responsible for personnel and political ideas; the provincial education department is responsible for funds and related business'. Under his instigation, right-wing students Zeng Xiaoya and Wan Defu asked the secretary of the provincial committee to answer questions. If the answer was not satisfied, they put the slogans and large print newspapers on the car of the provincial committee secretary. \\nBenxiao Yu also famed fire among teachers and encouraged to attack the party. He gave the idea to several teachers, 'You should seize two points: one is the relationship between the party (that is, the relationship between the party and the non-party), and the relationship between leadership and leadership. These are the main points, and the others are chickens and garlic skin.' And he said to Zong Yuanya, the right-wing, 'What did you sing? 'If not, I tell you what contradictions are caught'; in addition, I take the initiative to find teachers who have an opinion on their salaries and are close to them to ask them, 'Why not?' \\nAfter the anti-right struggle began, the Party Committee convened an expanded meeting to study the object and strategy of the struggle. After the meeting, Ben Xianyu said to the right-wing activists: 'I have suggested that the Party Committee's struggle is mainly Xu Gaohui. The rest of the people are not focused on it. Don't hurt feelings, and take care of future work.' Defending the rightists among the masses, who defame the party's democratic centralization, he said it was 'ideological clutter'. Benxiao Yu also planned the way forward for the right-wing, and said to the right-wing, 'You say 'there is sectarianism in the party. 'This statement should be reviewed. Only one can say that individual comrades within the party are ununited.' On the matter of launching a whole school signature to the right-wing party committee and provincial committee to attack the party committee and provincial committee, after the anti-right struggle has deepened, he said: 'Your signature is too much pressure on the leadership, and the impact is not good. You are smart people, quickly admit mistakes, lest you be criticized by classmates, and then review is not good.' Under the aegis of Ben Effectiveness, one, two and three classes of anti-right struggle in Chinese language subjects, which he divided his duties, was extremely weak. Several of the most crazy right-wing students Wan Defu, Wang Siyi, Liao Guozhen and Li Shaoming are waiting for a mixed pass. \\nIn order to divert the attention of the masses, after the fight against the right has been deepened, Cardia is still spreading myths among the masses, saying what 'anti-right struggle should not be reversed into the party', saying that the activists in the anti-right struggle in schools are 'emotional impulse, too impatient.' \\nFrom the material revealed, it is not accidental to attack the Party. He has consistently confronted his leadership, ununited, promoted and treated. Since the establishment of the teacher college was not a deputy principal and did not participate in the school party committee, he has been more dissatisfied with the Party, and has been neglected to work and resist the leadership. Usually arrogant, emptiness, blow others, elevate yourself. In the masses often show off that they have skills, often make fallacies about the leading cadres contacted, saying that it doesn't work, this is very poor, saying, 'I don't know how the Party knows how to understand people.' According to the public's revelations, when he worked in Jiujiang and Duchang, he cracked down on the leadership, and attacked his superiors and his peers all party members he knew, and even slandered. The lecturer was built on the basis of the secondary teacher training schools he had led in the past, and now 'made a mess.' He often carried out pulling and pulling, the officials made a wish to establish personal prestige. When the Ministry of Culture and Education of the Provincial Committee decided to mobilize his work, he carried out activities among teachers and students, slandered that school party committee secretary 'listen to bias, have eyes unaware, deliberately slander him'. When students argue and rectify the fierce, he encouraged the masses to keep him, and when he heard that the movement was suspended, he also proclaimed: Many students retained me at the petition to Governor Shao, and the governor decided that I was not tuned.' He said to Jiujiang Normal Zhou, 'Come to me, this is a higher school.' To Mr Ho Su-mei, the head of the Faculty and Academic Affairs Office, said: 'You will be the director of the further education department The results are not achieved, making weeks, any peace of mind. He wanted to become a teacher college supervisor and said, 'The masses all have this view. I think I will be vice-president, but my qualifications are not enough!' Even fabricated that the leadership thought he was the head of the office was a 'mantra'. He also provoked discord and movings. If Li Xin, director of the rotating training department, has always had exclusive opinions on the teacher, he said to Li Qiao that President Hu was engaged in, and so on. Benxiao Yu, when vice-chancellor of secondary teacher training school, actually openly incited opposition leaders at the whole school conference, saying what: 'Our classmates are not cheerful, their destiny is from, dare not daring to doubt the country's major events, do not dare to dare to make negative opinions.' On several occasions, pedagogical conferences called for independent thinking and bold opposition to leadership. He also seriously leaked party secrets. He usually told outsiders of the party's organization of life meetings, the party committee's expansion meeting, and his superior leadership, and even took the party documents to the party comrades. He openly resisted the party's countervailing policy, saying that it was inappropriate to search for a person in question during rebellion; it was not appropriate for the opponents to pull and pull, eat and drink and play, causing extremely bad effects among the masses. He publicly admired that 'Chiang Kai-shek is a historical figure and has a set in military, political and diplomatic terms', saying Ge Pui Qi 'used to be a lecturer and can now be famous.' He said, 'Although Zeng Guofan has a reactionary set, he has a set,' and he 'envy the power of the Japanese pseudo-police.' The Soviet Union was also blatantly defamated. \\nThis fact shows that right-wing elements in the party have some capital more than ordinary right-wing elements and can easily confuse the masses. Therefore, the deep excavation must be carried out with determination. (Jiangxi Daily, September 21, 1957)\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"}

By the family, hanging Peking Opera little voice from an early age, will sing Peking Opera Tsing Yi. In August 1919, Bian yulin Yulin junior high school, admitted to Baoding Army Officer School Infantry Section 9, four years graduated in August 1923, as deputy officer in Fu Zuoyi, in charge of propaganda and entertainment work. Later, the troops set up the Peking Opera Company, because Fu Zuoyi was also a student of the fifth infantry of the Baoding Army Officer School, and Bian yulin Yulin is an alumni, so arranged Bian yulin Yulin as the Captain of the Peking Opera Company Bian yulin Yulin love play, he led all the actors, rehearsed a lot of peking operas. After the performance was praised by the audience, people praised Fu Zuoyi troops for their recreational activities. \\nIn January 1949, Bian yulin Yulin with Fu Zuoyi troops in Beijing uprising. After learning training, the organization considered that he was the leader of the theatre company, was born from Peking Opera family, and used only, arranged him to Hebei Province Xuanhua Theatre Company as manager, all day to deal with the actors of various theatre troupes, this work is very suitable for Bian yulin Yulin. \\nThe theater has a secretary, an old cadre of the Eighth Route Army, and the theater was formed by him. In the past, he was a manager and secretary, and he had nothing to say about anything. Now he arranged a Kuomintang officer to sit and split his power in his hands. He could not think about it, nor would he be willing to hand over his power to others. \\nBian yulin Yulin as manager, division responsible for the management of theatrical administrative affairs, can not do the main thing. Usually buy office supplies have to be approved by the secretary, employees have to take leave and find secretary, Bian yulin Yulin is purely an empty shelf with no authority. This is also very worried for Bian yulin Yulin. More than 100 yuan monthly wages are paid on time, more than twice as high as the salary of the secretary 76 yuan per month. The secretary often said strange in the back, 'I'm not as good as the counter-revolution, Bian yulin Yulin has opposed a lifetime revolution, higher than our treatment!' \\nAt that time, the four big names of Peking Opera travelled to various parts of the country. Three performances were performed at the Xuanhua Theatre. The theater retail tickets were not many. Some fans wanted to see the famous corner performances and could not buy tickets at all. At this time, there were several officers who turned to work together with Bian yulin Yulin, who bought a few theater tickets, touching the nails. Someone said in person: 'The old side, you, this theater manager, should be really a cavity, even a few tickets can't buy!' Bian yulin Yulin dry angry there is no place to say. \\nIn 1957, the whole wind movement began, Bian yulin Yulin said at the time of the great Ming enlarged: 'I am this theater manager, an empty shelf with no power, not even the right to sell a few tickets. The big and small things in the factory are told by a secretary. What do I want this manager to do?' \\nAt the end of the anti-right movement, Bian yulin Yulin was identified as a right-wing element. Its criminal acts were: Bian yulin Yulin, a reactionary bourgeois family was born to the enemy of the people after junior high school, relying on Chiang Kai-shek to study at the Army Officer School in Baoding, joining the Kuomintang team after graduation, suppressing the People's Revolutionary Movement and officials to the rank of Colonel. It is an executioner with his hands stained with the blood of the people. After the peaceful liberation of Beijing in 1949, after the peaceful liberation of Beijing, the people's government arranged him to be theatre manager, and he was nurtured by senior officials Houlu. His reactionary nature does not change, and still gives power to the people. In particular, during the big magnification, he thinks that the time is ripe to attack the party rampant and stigmatize the Party's cadre policy. When he was a theatre manager, he said he had no authority. Can the proletarian regime be in the hands of your reactionary officer? He also often spread the corrupt life of Kuomintang officers among the masses, advocating how the American equipment of Kuomintang troops is advanced...\\nBian yulin Yulin was sentenced to six years' imprisonment and sent to the labor force for reforming labor on the basis of historical counter-revolutionaries plus the current counter-revolutionary crime (rampant attack against the party when counterright). \\nHe was a man in his 50s in 1957. After going to the reform team, he was old and weak, and put him into the literary group to prepare a 'tabloid of labour reform'. Praise the good people among the prisoners, criticize backward elements who do not confess guilt, not to work in the group, and when a special prisoner is unfortunate. \\nIn 1959, 'National Day', the labor reform team pardoned several prisoners who were actively working, undergoing rehabilitation and performing well in all aspects. After the amnesty congress, the leadership arranged several shows to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the National Day. Everyone knows that Bian yulin Yulin will sing Peking Opera, so arrange for him a section of Peking Opera Oratorio. Bian yulin Yulin sang a piece of 'June Snow', which is a song play in Tsing Yi to show the singing skills of the horn actor. Bian yulin Yulin, this half a hundred old man, sang with a small voice of Tsing Yi, the drama that Dou E told grievances, won a burst of applause from the audience under stage. \\nAmong the inmates in the labour force, there are also people who understand the play. After the incident, activists reported, 'June Snow', also called 'Dou E Injury', is a drama that Dou E complained about grievances. Edge Yulin issue play, for their own grievances. Correctional officers looked at the report material, and this was still necessary. Bian yulin Yulin openly filmed grievances in the labour reform team, using the platform of the tenth anniversary of the National Day to incite prisoners to discontent with the government. So called Bian yulin Yulin for questioning, and Bian yulin Yulin denies. But no matter how he explains, because the 'wrong' word is the most repudiated in the labor force, if the prisoners are all grievances and grievances, will the proletarian dictatorial regime not turn the sky up! \\nNo matter how Bian yulin Yulin pleaded, because he sang a period of 'June Snow', and was added three years in prison at the labor force. The two were combined with nine years' imprisonment. After nine years of imprisonment, Bian yulin Yulin was already an old man in his 60s. He left the world without catching up with the day that the right was picked up. \\nAlthough he has now been cleared, what is the use of that? People are dead!"}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attachment 2] Bian zhaoxiang: 'Sealing sin to the whole hospital, and from the people' (1957.7.25)\\nMy motivation to participate in the wind movement this time is unintentional. At the beginning, he said to people: 'This time the brink is very good, it is up to them (the Party Committee)', 'in the past they (the Party Committee), whole people, this time, the others (the masses), whole them.' That is to stand in a hostile position, hold the attitude of the blessing, take the opportunity of the wind, want to retaliate, in order to vent the grievances of the party for a long time. Assault against the party rampant under the guise of helping the party rectify. At the first colloquium between professors and professors Fu, they used the words 'put a needle now, not afraid to take a cone in the future' to close the mouth of the Party Committee and not allow the Party Committee to speak. Then a series of disinformation and slander were taken to consciously collect all aspects of the party's shortcomings, as well as all possible distortions, distorted and fabricated, and reached to slander the leadership, stigmatize the party committee, incite the masses, disrupt party relations, and rampant attacks against the party. During the winds, the tactics of two factions have been consistently used to carry out conspiracy activities, and rarely speak at the meeting, and will vigorously incite the masses to discontent with the party, provoking everyone to come up to attack the party, and pretend people behind them. My anti-party anti-socialist conspiracy against the people has been purposeful, strategic, organized and planned from the outset. \\nI have always been dissatisfied with the party. Apart from putting guns at meetings, I often use sectarianism to attack the party in vicious ways. Since I stand in the position of the bourgeois, I have a strong decadent bourgeoisie thought, everything starts from personal interests, and when the party cannot fully satisfy its personal interests, I slander the Party. has deteriorated, turned into private fraud, sectarianist groups sheltering each other, in personnel Appointment is entirely a 'nepotism' style.' Therefore, in the first stage of the wind movement, it was said, 'Our hospital mainly reflects sectarianism'. I use sectarianism to stigmatize the party, with the aim of stigmatizing dissociating party relations, diverging unity within and outside the party, in order to break the party and abolish the party's leadership in schools, and then to put our schools on the path of capitalism that conforms to my decadent bourgeois ideology, which is to revive the bourgeois education. \\nAnother issue for attacking the party is the 'welfare fee issue', using the fact that others fabricated, provoke the right and wrong here, push the waves, but fear the world is not messy, saying, 'The publication of the list of welfare fees is a conspiracy, confusing it.' This provoked a lot of people's dissatisfaction with the personnel department, rallied up to attack the party, provoking the first big wave since the whole wind. Intentionally stigmatize the party committee, stigmatize the party committee, crack down on the authority of the party committee and shake the confidence of the masses as a step towards defeating the party leadership in school. The reason why I took advantage of this issue and rampant attack against the party is because I have a strong bourgeoisie decaying idea for profit, and I have not been taken care of, I am extremely dissatisfied. Since the whole wind, I have played on the issue and attacked the party. \\nI have also systematically attacked the party by taking advantage of the anti-counter problem. Once there was a purpose to strategically organize a special meeting to chase Chen Huahui, and aimed at fighting the Party Committee's 'peace and recuperation' by means of spicy and insidious practices. The aim is to (i), reject the achievements of rebellion and the need for rebellion; and then negate the achievements and necessity of past major movements, which is to oppose the democratic dictatorship of the people and against socialism. (2), take advantage of the sentiments of everyone in the 'rehabilitation meeting' to fight against the Party Committee and carry out revenge, (3), pull together people who have been criticized for fighting against their mistakes, and engage in sectarianism activities and actively attack the party. \\nIn addition, all techniques have been used: to distort facts, fabricate rumors, exaggerate shortcomings, emphasize mistakes, and also go everywhere to find 'materials', visit former President Yin Fu, visit Professor Wang Jiayin, provoke Wen Changyun incident, and so on, with the aim of provoking the world as much as possible, to provoke the right and wrong, and crack down on the leadership. In order to achieve the goal of breaking down and defeating the Party Committee, the Party Committee was slandered into three factions: Chen Zigu, Xiao Ying, and Yin Fengxiang. Thinking that Chen Zigu is a faction of origin representing intellectuals, understands the situation of intellectuals, and is also most respectful to the intellectuals. Xiao Yingyi is a centrist, he can still be approached to the intellectuals and can cooperate, but he still has to rely on Yin Fengxiang. Swing around; Yin Fengxiang's faction is a group of rural cadres, who have taken the general power of the personnel office since 1952. Controlling a large number of cadres by means of personnel information, salary increases and promotions. The most powerful thing is Song x Zhang. This party intellectuals do not really understand, only listen to reports, do not contact the masses. They are standard bureaucracy, and they protect each other, officials are also standard sectarianist groups. The purpose of this kind of polarization is to use a one-and-a-a-dozen method to break through each party committee. Why should I pull together Chen Zigu and Xiao Ying factions, and focus on fighting Yin Pai? Mainly because it is not satisfied with the current personnel system and opposes a cadre policy with both merit and talent. \\nIn carrying out anti-party anti-socialist activities, the main way is to engage in sectarianism activities, which is to pull together some people who are not satisfied with the party, echo each other, support each other and attack the party together. Ma Wanjun, Wang Hao, Jiang Yinchang, Zhou Darong, Wang Yiping, Du Guan, etc. Here Ma Wanjun has the highest discontent with the party, and attacks against the party is the most intense. He distorted the theory of the party to attack the party. I think he is better than me and most tasted him. Therefore, he often contacted him, with no big or small, and always exchange information, exchange views, reach a unified pace, and unequivocally attack the party. \\nWang Hao and Du Guanzhong are mainly engaged in the Volcano newspaper, as the main force of foreign propaganda, especially Wang Hao, is very active, very active, and can independently drill into and attack the party. Wang Yiping mainly contacted the administration to provide some information and help write big print newspapers. Jiang Yin Chang, Zhou Tai Rong, mainly linked with the rock, through their close cooperation with Shade, and Jiang Yin Cheong was also a member of the conference. Our union is based on a common offensive target-party leadership, who stand on the bourgeois position and is an anti-socialist temporary United Front. \\nMy anti-socialist activity has historical roots. I am an intellectuals from old society, from birth to education, are the bourgeois set, with a strong bourgeois decay. After several major movements after liberation, not only did not receive education, change their position and give up the bourgeois decadent ideology, but on the contrary, because of the land reform, reactionary father was struggled and swept out, adding hatred to the party, and the reformation of ideas and the anti-rebellion movement did not play much role in educating itself. Deepened disgust. So since the whole wind movement, thought that the opportunity came, held a kind of revenge thought and participated in the whole wind movement. \\nBecause I stand on the Bourgeois position and have a strong bourgeois decay idea, in this rectification movement, distorted the facts, fabricated rumors, provoked the right and wrong, fought the party leadership, caused confusion in the mind of the whole hospital, thus affecting our learning and work, so the class had to stop Come down, start the fight against the right-wing elements, the loss is huge and serious And the responsibility for causing such damage is primarily me, so in addition to the detailed account and in-depth examination in the classroom, please allow me first of all to appeal to the comrades of the house and to the people of the whole country.

Also said: Our school personnel use completely nepotism, our main contradiction is sectarianism. \\nBian zhaoxiang said: Welfare fees are only care for the Party Committee and Party member cadres. They do not take care of teachers. Welfare fees are collective fertilizers and are moral corruption. \\nBian zhaoxiang said: I have a personal responsibility, neither a job nor a right. I did not enjoy this name, and I did not enjoy this name. All things are led by Ma Xingyuan. There is something to discuss with comrades Chen Huahui and other comrades. No power, no duty, only responsibility, this seems to be being exploited. So when I don't think about my mind, I think about the question of whether to trust me. Although I am the director, I also have Ye Junlin (Party Branch Book), especially many problems I can't speak to solve. Let Comrade Chen Huahui solve it. \\nBian zhaoxiang said: Our hospital is a collective of intellectuals, unlike factories, rural areas, and the military, and the way leaders often use in factories, rural areas, and the army to treat this collective is not feasible. (Original note: Bian zhaoxiang, while talking about the above paragraph, Ma Wanjun said: 'There is also the method of the Public Security Bureau.'), \\nThe Party has no trust in intellectuals, and relations between intellectuals and the party committee are cold, as if they were in a big enemy. \\nBian thinks Chu Anping is very interesting: dared to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou to propose 'little monk, big monk'. He said, 'What the dean's office actually works is Zhang Lansun, one head is Li Gengyao. The actual work of the Education Office is Wang Shufang, one head is see autumn, and the equipment department actually works is Zhou Yi, and one head is Wang Kechang.' 'Party world' is based on facts. For example, large and small units have a party member who does not work for dinner. \\nBian zhaoxiang said: 'The party committee of our hospital is divided into three factions, one is represented by Xiao Ying. One is represented by Chen Zigu as a representative of intellectuals, and one is Yin Fengxiang (including Liu Yi, Wang Qinghua, etc.), the most bastard, driving this faction out of school. \\nBian zhaoxiang said: The Party is like the KMT training the army as educating members of the Party. Party members are puppets, they don't have to brainstorm. What happens to party members, otherwise party members don't know how to act well, they will become people who can't think independently, do not dare to argue. \\nPAGE 5"}

When discussing Chairman Mao's report on 'correctly handling the problems of internal contradictions among the people', she said: 'Will there be a political party in the future that can prove it better than the Communist Party?' Who can't be sure why the Communist Party can't step down if there is one? He also said: 'Party leaders can be discussed, and now they do not seem to be allowed to discuss. As soon as they discuss, they will hold the hats of right-wing elements.' \\n2. When Zhu Anping's 'Party World' fallacy was countered, she said in a panel discussion: 'Party world' is a fact! ... There is no reason to criticize some people now, just saying that the word 'Party world' is not good. After the meeting, she also spread: 'Party world' is very reasonable. It is indeed a party member in the big and small organs. This is indeed the 'Party world'! And saying 'Party world', that's how it happened, just speaking differently. \\n3. At a panel meeting, she said: 'Marxinism can criticize the debate, why can't the party leadership debate'? 'It seems that no debate is allowed now (according to the party leadership)'. \\nSecond, on the attitude towards the movements led by the Party\\n1, she had spread: 'The ideological transformation movement does not make people garment. After the transformation of the mind, people are worse, first, there are words not dare to say, say bad to fight, second, learn to speak false words. \\n2. Her vicious stigmatization campaign led by the Party is: 'The Party wants to divide the whole people', and said: 'Every movement is not the same, it is all set set up by the party. What to do, Tsinghua is like this.' \\n3, she never talked about the view of counteraction, but she gave some examples to illustrate the 'fight wrong'. She said: 'Such as the electromechanical counteraction situation, the fight wrong is not dealt with even, to know how much it is to fight the wrong person!' \\n4, she said: 'Every sport is these tricks,-criticize, check, so after every sport, I still do not change.' And said, 'After so many sports, I'm still me.' She felt that in sports, just some honest people were unlucky, she was a smart man, and she was not afraid of these tricks. \\n5. On one occasion, after Mr. Yang (researcher Yang Jiachi), welcomed the Soviet experts meeting, she litigated the Party's policy of intellectuals transformation, saying that the Party had no achievements in the intellectuals, and was brutal in some attitudes. \\n6, she said, 'When some people talk about the problem seems to be forced out, otherwise it can't be done.' \\n7, 'She said that when those who were fighting against me, I see nothing, but living them into a counter-revolution'. And he said, 'What if you want to add sin?' \\nIII. ON THE LIFE OF PEOPLE\\n1. When Ge Pei Qi's remarks were published in the People's Daily, everyone hated very much. Some people raised objections to Ge's remarks, but she said: 'Let him say good, why should you oppose?' She was asked, Ge Peiqi, and said, 'People's lives are lowered, is it right? 'This is a part of the intellectuals,' she said. At the same time, she thinks Ge Pei Qi can say such words, very courageous. \\n2. She said: 'People's lives have not improved after liberation. After liberation, the population has increased, not because the lives of working people have improved, but because the state subsidies are too much. So workers farmers desperately have children.' \\n3, she often spread: 'now good things can not eat, and can not buy, good things are not exported, or not come in.' \\n4, she said: 'Farmers bad, pay rent (refers to public grain), always pay bad rice.' \\nFourth, on personnel work and cadre policy issues\\n1, she said, 'People in the Personnel Section eat, do not work, we have less than 100 people, personnel section to four or five people, one day to night or not know people.' \\n2, 'Personnel Section is an individual system! The personnel section of the organs is almost all the same, to try some party members. You are optimistic that the lover of the old cadre has a seat in the Personnel Section or the General Affairs Group. \\n3. She said, 'Ouyang Jiang makes good sense. Indeed, the Party has given credit too much to think about the sweat. In fact, for such cadres as long as they give him some high salaries, he should not be given leadership status.' \\n4, she is in favor of Ouyang Jiang's 'bureaucratic travel' fallacy, and often preach. \\n5, she said, 'There is sectarianism in sending international students, Bai Rong did not go to Rusu because he is not a party member...'\\n6, after criticizing Ouyang Jiang raised about the issue of 'open files', she said: 'I do not see what bad file disclosure.' \\nFifth, the views of the party members\\n1. She often says that cadres of the Party Corps are 'officials' and 'officials' have 'bureaucratic'. And often says, 'Party members have privileges.' \\n2, she often spread: 'Party members, team members are not terrific, joining the party is for personal interests, is to promote faster. Who knows they say a set in their mouth, think about one.' 'Progress is not yet to say in the mouth, obedience distribution is for others.' \\n3, she was very unsatisfied with the team cadres in Tsinghua to talk to her, she said: 'They are people who manage people, I hate Tsinghua, pipe head pins, that is, tube is not good.' \\n4, she said, 'The party is a dogma, did the party members of course promoted quickly. In Changchun Personnel Section party members upgraded quickly. Political insurance is taking the lead, party members are also for individuals.' \\n5, she said: 'Party members must be a very dogmatic person, one accompany all over the party group is good party members.' \\n6, 'Don't look at some people Marxism-Leninist dogma back much better, in fact is another matter.' \\n7, 'Party members are also divided into several levels, as Ouyang Jiang dares to say that party members are classified as third class party members.' He also said, 'Lang Shijun is still not much learning. If Lang Shijun and Qian Weichang have the same learning, he would be worse than Qian Weichang.' \\nVI. Issues relating to the fight against the right\\n1, 'What I hate is that Qian Weichang does not engage in science, bias politics, who let him go to this, when that, honestly as a professor, nothing is gone.' \\nHe also said, 'Qian Weichang, he deserves it, who let him go to politics, and engage in politics will always fall.' \\n2, 'Ma Shixiong (Professor of Tsinghua University), said a few words, he had no experience, don't see him return early, but he did not participate in sports, no experience. If the people who participate in the campaign will not mess up, said at most review, what's amazing, afraid of?' \\n3, she said, 'Tsinghua engaged in money Weichang, must have been arranged by the Party Committee. Jiang Nanxiang and Qian Weichang have private feud. Everyone knows that Qian Weichang is the highest in Tsinghua.' \\n4, 'Qian Weichang should refuse to review, remove these positions, as a professor.' \\n5, 'so long money can not do it.' \\n6, 'senior intellectuals are bone', have their own opinions, otherwise how to call senior intellectuals? \\n7, 'Money is so good, so good, now nothing is good.' 'The critical review, after which people are not big scientists, must not use them.' \\n8, 'Some old professors in Tsinghua, meetings are not invited, sports do not attend, do not speak, you have no way to him, want to criticize or criticize. These people have no other way, but they have an old idea.' \\n9, she said: 'Qian Weichang has been very progress, money's speech is very right, he dare to say, he dare to speak, he is courageous, there are many generations who dare not to speak, he is not afraid to speak, more words will lose, this can be obscure, to his head.' And said: 'Ma × × why always take the greatest malice to measure people, every sentence should always be extended and extended.' \\n'Qian Weichang is a Polish academician who has international prestige. If you make a mistake, the consequences are very serious, and the Party Committee will be responsible.' \\n10. She thinks that the reason for becoming right-wing elements is because of their high knowledge and the current politics cannot meet their demands. \\n11, 'People's Daily' is ridiculous, the domestic affairs are published.' (refers to the statement of the beard baby critique chapter.), \\n12, she thinks the masses rise up anti-right is blindly hit 'falling dog'. \\n13, she said: 'Sick in the movement is a good way, if Fu Zuoyi is not sick, also has to be a right.' \\n14, after reading the Peking University Wall, excitedly said: 'Peking University has always had a democratic tradition, students have freedom of thought, dare to say.' \\n15, she often said: 'I used to speak because I like to speak, caused a lot of trouble, so now learn good, not much speech.' \\n16, now dig the old base whether a stick to death (refers to the right), killing Zhang Bojun beat others. \\n17. We do not know whether the People's Daily is taken out of context, because there is no full text published in the full text of the statement of the Chuu Anping, it is necessary to put the 'party world' clear and then talk about it and ask the government to publish the materials. \\n18, when she saw the newspaper published workers, peasants up to counter the right speech, she said: 'Workers, farmers only know to eat, eat, and intellectuals demand freedom, democracy, and now turn out most of the right are intellectuals...' so she concludes that 'knowledge is Sin'. \\nVII. Other\\n1, she usually often stay out of the mood of the previous life, said before eating comfortable, wear attention, now good things can not eat and can not buy, good things are not going abroad or come in. Usually she often talked about how much good the material imported before...\\nShe also enjoyed jazzz music, and on one occasion she wanted to borrow these records for an admiration session. \\nShe said: 'I think Afei music is very good. It is not necessary to talk about anything thinking.' \\n2. She thinks: 'There is no good literary works because it emphasizes the political nature of literature and art, and also makes the same evaluation of the film.' 'Movies are for pastime, you must think about thinking that you can't make a good movie,' she said. She also cited examples of literaries from the period of Emperor Russia, arguing that they did not emphasize politics, so they could write excellent works. \\n3, Mayakovsky's death 54 anniversary, she said: 'Ma is only known to charge people, brave, and they are cowards, suicide.' \\n4, Tsinghua has no academic air, are the upper hand of officials. \\n5, to have achievements not to go abroad (refers to the United Kingdom and the United States). \\n6, she often said: 'Some organs have people love to give advice, so can not upgrade, obedient can quickly upgrade.' \\n7, after a panel discussion, said: 'The People's Daily is indeed the good news.' \\n8, she said: 'The PLA is good for everything, because people are the army!'

At this point, Bi can be in it. On 18 December of the same year, Bi ke died. According to the document 'Conclusion on Bi ke's Cleanup' issued on September 10, 1963 by the leadership group of Dunhuang County Committee of the Communist Party of China (CCP), the day, month and day of death was December 18, 1960. For the day of death of Bi ke, the author is suspicious. According to the book 'Experience-My 1957' written by Fengming, the central government found that the far-left error of the Gansu Provincial Committee led to a large number of deaths of right-wing elements in the gutter in December 1960, whether they had taken 'hats' or did not remove the 'hat'. Return to the original unit recuperation, save lives. According to this order, why did Bi ke not return to the original unit and die in Mingshui Village in Gaotai County? I have a variety of assumptions about this issue: one is that at this time can have been tortured by starvation for three years, unable to go to the road and die in the excitement of the 'amnesty'; second, at this time, he can wait for the leadership of the Dunhuang Cultural Heritage Institute to pick him back, but long and short, looking to wear. Dying in sight; three is that at this time, the 'hat' of the 'bad elements' is worn, not the right elements returning to the original unit Column, he died in despair. Of course, it may also have died before December 18, 1960. \\nThree years after Bi ke's death, that is, on December 30, 1963, the CCP Jiuquan Committee issued (63), 574 Red Head Document No. 574, 'The Approval of the Conclusion of Re-education through Labour Officers'. This approval said: 'Dunhuang County Committee: reported the clean-up conclusions of pensioners on the farm, and reviewed the situation by the Standing Committee on November 18, 1963 by the Standing Committee of the Land Commission on November 18, 1963, and agreed that your county should restore honor and restore nationality to Bi can be unstable, not dismissed from public office or re-education through labour. But it should be pointed out about Beyker's misstatement that criticism is given education. Jiuquan Land Commission, 30 December 1963 (official seal). In the Liquidation Conclusions on Bi ke attached to this approval, it is stated that Bi ker 'died of illness on 18 December 1960'. But the approval also said 'education of criticism'. Criticism of education who? Criticism of education already bizarre? Is anyone dead yet not allowing him to rest quietly and quietly in another world where there is no troubles and no hunger? 'Whip the ashes' is the boring behavior of China's feudal society rulers. After all, we are communists who believe in materialism! \\n2\\nWhat kind of 'bad molecule' is Bi ke? In Dunhuang City Archives, I did not find a single line of material he was identified as bad. All you can see now is the 'Conclusion on the Liquidation of Bi ke' written by the anti-right leadership group of Dunhuang County Committee of the Communist Party of China on September 10, 1963. \\nThe conclusion said that at Shenyang Lu Xun Art College and the Central Academy of Drama, he complained about the failure to raise the study to help blonde, aroused individualism, and saw the reactionary slogans do not report. On the performance of Bi ke's visit to the Dunhuang Cultural Heritage Institute, the conclusion alleges that 'the Institute of Cultural Relics is a research institution and the Dunhuang County Committee cannot lead at all.' The county committee secretary called him to go, and he said, 'I'm not interested in this kind of person at all.' To the wage system, he said: 'A thousand years of daughter-in-law boil into a mother-in-law, the avenue of thousands of years In a quarrel with the director × × ×, Bicko said: 'To be honest, when I did the revolution, you still ran with the KMT! But it was eating foreign rice for a few years.' Bi ke once said: 'Some people say that my party group has a sectarian, in fact, do not have to be afraid, in fact we are a sectarian.' \\nAt this point, I think of 'The Emperor's New Cloth,' in that parable that the emperor's undressed people were accused of stupid by liars. And in front of the Dunhuang Cultural Relics Institute and the Dunhuang County Committee, he said that some people would have to be expelled from their registrations, expelled from public office, designated as bad elements, and sent to the earth's hell-the ditch went to 're-education through labour', and finally put their lives there! \\nEverything shows that in the era when the unit leader is the incarnation of the party, the criticism of the party's leadership is the anti-party's mindset is seen by some people as a god, even if it is cheaper to put on you the 'hat' of the right, and the 'bad elements' of BIKE have the same end as the right. \\nSome say, 'Lessons are to be exchanged with blood.' After three years of hunger, displacement and death, the Dunhuang County Committee said in the 'Conclusion of the Cleanup on Bi ke': 'In contrast to the spirit of the relevant provisions of the policy boundaries, on 5 October 1963, the 71st meeting of the County Standing Committee considered that the original qualitative treatment was inadequate, and that its mistakes were of the nature of internal contradictions within the people. It shall be dealt with in a manner that deals with the internal contradictions of the people, and no dictatorship should be used.' \\n3\\nIn September 2002, when I worked in provincial cities, the author acquired the original 'Gansu Daily' reporter and Fengming's 'experience-my 1957\\ book. This book contains a paragraph about the painful scenes of Bi ke in Jiuquan edging and Gaotai Mingshui River after reading. It is now reproduced in Hereafter to comfort the faithful soul:\\nWang Zhi (formerly directed by the Northwest Military Region Combat Literature Corps), met the painter of Dunhuang Heritage Institute during the Mingshui Station. He graduated from the Northeast Lu Xun Institute of Literature and Arts, and his love for painting art is more than his love for life. Before they relocated from the sandwich groove farm to the Mingshui River, the leadership arranged, we want everyone to streamline the outfit. Only cover and carry items that are worn with them, all others are not allowed to take away. Bi can violate the rules. It was hard to bring a few of the world's famous paintings to the Mingshui River, hard to find a place for his beloved paintings in a narrow cellar. Despite the empty stomach, in the time of the time, Bi ke still turned out the big album, God tour in the art hall of famous paintings, enjoy a spirit dinner, until forget everything. Bi Ke told Wang Zhi that he was the right, because he was proud of himself, despised the director of the Dunhuang Cultural Relics Institute at the time □ □ □ (author note: '□ □ □' is the original original, under the same; Editor's Note: Refers to Chang Book Hong). □ □ □ In 1957 already joined the party, Bi can hit the top of the □ □ □ □, say not inferior, say what: 'When I participated in the revolution, you don't know what to do!' When fighting against the right, Bi can be sent early on to Jiuquan Sandwich Farm for re-education through labor on charges of leadership of opposition party members. Of course, he disobedience, but nothing. On the day of a large increase in the number of dead people, one night, Wang Zhi went to the office, and saw several cadres boiled in a pot on the stove, and saw several people constantly tearing off paintings from several thick paintings and stuffed into the hearth as fuel. Wang Zhi recognized at a glance that the tear was precisely Bi ke's beloved album. He immediately concluded that Bi ke was no longer in the world. Listen to the crisp 'hissing' sound of their tearing pages, Wang Zhi's heart was trembled. He felt that the 'hissing' sound was such a sharp and sharp ear, so that he saw the cadres indifferent and ruthlessly continue to tear off the drawing pages, and suddenly developed a whim that should cut those hands off. Bi ke is a very respectable friend in his heart, experienced various unimaginable tribulations in his hard labor re-education career, in the last days of his life, still dedicated to his love of painting art. The power of this personality is extraordinary, but his flesh and flesh cannot exceed the limits of human life, and he is still able to eat and hate to leave. It was regarded as a treasure of art more precious than life, and after losing the guardian of his life, it became fuel for correctional officers when they cooked soup. \\nMore than twenty years later, Wang Zhi visited the Dunhuang Heritage Institute with freedom and met Duan Wenjie, director at this time. During this period, over 99,98 per cent of the country's original rightists have been 'corrected' to rectify the rebellion. Wang Zhi could not forget a distant friend who had long died, and asked Duan Wenjie about his situation. Duan Wenjie's answer surprised him. Duan Wenjie said critically: 'Bi ke is not right at all. We held a solemn memorial conference for him. ' Originally, after the Dunhuang Institute of Cultural Relics designated Bi ke as a right-wing element and after criticism, it immediately announced his dismissal from public office, sent him to Jiuquan Biangou Farm for re-education through labour as an extreme right and sent his materials to the relevant provincial authorities for approval. After some days, the materials sent to the province were returned. The approval documents believed that Bi ke had serious dissatisfaction with the individual, and that his remarks did not reach the anti-party anti-socialist nature, and therefore could not be classified as right-wing elements. When the approval arrived in the place, the decision to dispose of Bi ke in the house had long been announced, and Bi ke had long been re-education through labor at the sandwich groove farm for many days. In order to maintain the face of the director □ □ □, the place will be wrong, the approval will be pressed down, can not be recalled, until Bi can pass through misery and death, he himself does not know that the approval of the province has long given him a pacification. □ □ □ As the founder of the Dunhuang Institute of Cultural Relics, it has long been a celebrity of world culture. But when he ascended the throne of power, he would not allow a descendant who spoke uninferior to him-in terms of age and artistic seniority. The anti-right struggle in 1957 gave him a chance of full venting and revenge, who had inflated his lust. As director, he was the incarnation of the party leadership. According to the thinking pattern at that time, the leader of the opposition party was anti-socialism. With a little guidance, he sees himself as a pinnacle to turn over the ground, making the revolutionary seniority earlier than him can become a class enemy. Even if he did not receive the approval of his superiors later, he was still going to kill Bi ke who had landed on the Jiuquan Sandwich Farm. If it were not 20 years later that China had undergone a radical change, and the screening and correction of more than 550,000 wronged right-wing elements, the material that had not been approved by the province for the right would still be sleeping in the file bag. After a few personnel changes, the general person does not know that there is a paper on the approval document lying in the archive bag. At this time, the director changed to Duan Wenjie. He was persecuted in the 'Cultural Revolution', and was particularly serious in reviewing the right-wing grievances in 1957, so only a blatant grievance emerged. \\nExcerpt here, the author thought of an ancient Chinese saying: 'A will succeed in all the bones'. Duan Wenjie old man said that Beiche was not a right-wing. So far, I did not find the documents of Dunhuang County Committee and Zhangye Land Committee, which are sure to be right-wing elements in Dunhuang City Archives. However, on June 20, 1958, by Dunhuang County Committee study identified as 'bad molecules', and on October 8 of the same year the Zhangye Administration approved dismissal from public office and re-education through labour, sending Jiuquan sandwich gutter farm to implement the decision is unclear. \\nWhether the trajectory of history is taking such an obscure path: when the Dunhuang Cultural Heritage Institute reported to the provincial culture bureau report on the right has not been approved, the Dunhuang Heritage Institute has sent Bi ke on the path of no return. From the administrative point of view, Dunhuang County and Zhangye special offices have the right to fix bad elements and give them the right to re-education through labour. Now what I see is that Dunhuang County appointed Bi can be bad elements and approved by the Zhangye Office, and at the same time, it will be expelled from public office, re-education through labor, and send Jiuquan to carry out documents. Doing so preserves x x x x's face and helps him remove nails from his eyes. All this can be done by the Dunhuang County Committee, the Zhangye Administration and the Dunhuang Cultural Relics Research Institute, in fact, gave Bi ke an additional death sentence. If history is true, then some of the people at the Dunhuang Institute of Antiquities were at the time. \\nA revolutionary struggle tested, seeing art as his own life so the new star fell. \\nAt the end of October 2004, the author and the elderly hand of Dunhuang Cultural Relics Research Institute, in 1957, the team secretary Guan Youhui the elderly to speak on the phone. He said that in the fall of 1978, the daughter of Bi ke came to Dunhuang Mogao Cave and asked the Dunhuang Heritage Institute to have a statement about sending his father to the gutter, and asked for his father's pacification. Bi ke's daughter lived in Mogao Cave for more than forty days, and the leader refused to receive it. At this time, it is late autumn and early winter, Mogao cave weather is a bit cold. One day, Bi ke's daughter took advantage of × × × in the house to meet guests, broke into the house, and with its big noisy, and also overturned the table. \\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached 2] Li Changyu: 'Dunhuang soul' and 'Dunhuang patron god' Chang Shu Hong\\nDunhuang has a thousand Buddha cave, thousand Buddha cave has a thousand year treasures of the Chinese nation-a huge number of mural paintings and color sculptures, especially in 1900 found a large number of 'Tibetan Jing Cave' which has been stored in thousands of ancient books, but due to unmanaged, a large number of rare treasures, were tested by the English, French, Russian, American, Japanese and other countries The ancient scholar' from an ignorant and ignorant king priest, so history Scholar Chen Yinke said: 'Dunhuang, the sad history of my country's academic history is also.' In 1943, in the most difficult time of the anti-Japanese war, the National Government's Supreme National Defense Council adopted a resolution, established the National Institute of Arts in Dunhuang in 1944, to carry out research and management on the thousands of Buddha cave in Dunhuang, after the change of the common book, the director said. The 1957 political typhoon that swept across the country also swept into this millennium cave in the desert. Not far from the Emperor Tian high, Dunhuang Qianfo cave, staged a big tragedy that devastated intellectuals. We can use Chen Yinke's words: 'Dunhuang, the sad history of scholars of my country is also.' \\nDunhuang since 1944 the National Government established the National Dunhuang Art Institute, people put forward two symbolic representatives, one is the director of the two dynasties Chang Shuhong, known as 'Dunhuang patron God', a painter who worked for a short time in the early 1950s of the last century, known as 'Dunhuang soul'. \\nHere, I want to recall the horrific tragedy of BIKE in the anti-right movement, known as the 'Soul of Dunhuang'. He was beaten as the right in his place and immediately sent to the famous re-education farm in Gansu province, but 20 years later, it was discovered that the Provincial Committee did not approve the 'Right Party's Approval Report'. As head of his right wing, Chang Shuhong and party branch secretary Li Chengxian and wife, concealed the fact that the Provincial Committee refused to approve, did not bring Bi back to par back, so Bi can starve to death in the sandwich ditch. Of course, it is impossible to know the black file in the red file cabinet. For the beike encounter, people are not sympathetic, also separate outrage, so called 'Dunhuang soul'. \\nSuch tragedies are not none among the 550,000 right-wing, but, after all, relatively few. \\nIn the process of writing, the author met a very accidental opportunity to interview the leaders, comrades, colleagues Gao Mang and Shi Ke from 1948 to 1952, and also telephone interview Bi Ke in the sandwich 'nest friend' and buried Bi ke's Ningli. Let me describe this tragedy, reveal it, reflect on it, and reflect on it, in order to sacrifice the grievances near Yumen Guan in the distant desert! My friends, Gao Mang, Shi Ko, and Ningli, and I, as the right-wing elements of common destiny, extend deep condolences to Beicheng's grievances! We will report to the world your thousands of goodies, so that the world can see the ugly, evil and evil nature of the anti-right movement and the authoritarian system! \\nRest in peace, Bi ke! \\n(A), the first time I know Bi can\\nMore than a year ago, I had a few words from Bi ker online, saying that he was born in 1930 and died in 1960. 'Lu Yi' graduated, in 1957 was beaten as the 'right', distributed to Jiuquan sandwich groove farm, died there. Fan Hua said: 'In fact, others are good, there is no intellectuals shelf.' That's it. Fan Hua is a clerk, old employee. [1] I speculate that from the birth of Bi ke in 1930, it may be a man of the liberation forge. \\n(2), the second time I know Bi ke\\nRecently, I found out from online Gansu writer Wang Jiada written 'Blood and tears cast Dunhuang', and had a more understanding of Bi ke. Wang Jiada recounts as follows:\\nBi ke, graduated from the Central Academy of Drama (to be precise, the Northeast Lu Xun College of Literature and Arts in Shenyang), took the initiative to work in Dunhuang. In the years of desperately looking back, the artist of the red devil was beaten as a 'class enemy' and sent to the sandwich groove farm to transform. A year later, he and a large number of cultural people starved there. The corpses could not be found, the companions took a pack of loess from the sandwich groove, buried on the sand slope under the Three Danger Mountains. Fenghua is mao, unremunerated, early broke up with his carved love of Dunhuang art. In order to comfort his spirit, his loved ones, his students, picked up a red stone from the mountain of Mingsha, inlaid on the tomb brick, made up of three characters: Dunhuang Soul. [2]\\nFrom this to know, Bi can have the reputation of 'Dunhuang soul'. This reputation was sealed by his loved ones and students. \\n(3), Bi ke in 1948 in Jiaodong Cultural Association colleague Gao Mong said\\nOn May 16, friends Ms. Gao Mang and her husband Liu Yuxuan went to Beijing to visit relatives and friends to return, visit the cold house, talk about things. Originally, they were all going to say, inadvertently, I talked about Dunhuang, speaking of Chang Shu Hong, talking about Dunhuang's anti-right movement, and brought up new topics. So Gao Mang sat down and continued to say: She was in Beijing for a meal, and met with the author of 'Experience-My 1957' and Fengming, because the book wrote the story of the right-wing re-education farm, asked her, there was a man named Bi ke, you know? Because Gao Mang once worked with Bi ke, later only heard that he had come to Dunhuang, hit the right, and died in the sandwich ditch. And Fengming said, I wrote it in the book, you didn't read it? Gao Mang said that I borrowed a book from a friend and just started watching. So, and Fengming introduced the situation of Bi ke. \\nNow, I write high memories first. \\nGao Mang is a writer of Qingdao. She was trapped in deep memories and introduced me to Bi ke: Beiche is at the tip of Jiaodong Peninsula, a child from the countryside, may be a little elementary school culture, will draw a few posters. Since 1948, they worked in Jiaodong Cultural Association. The main staff of the Cultural Association is the Cultural Corps, a collection of music and art singing and dancing such a large group of people, these people live a collective life, but because of the characteristics of the work, the life style of hanging lang when free and scattered, but is more famous. He has a lice on his clothes, he does not wash it, nest, stuffed into the snowdrift to freeze, after freezing, and then soaking urine to kill, Bi Ke said that it killed the lice, the extreme unscruffy look, that is, at that time, the crew also belongs to the heterogeneity. \\nLater in Qingdao, Bi Ke worked at the Workers' Culture Palace, but Gao Mang is still in the cultural system and there is a chance to meet. It was later known that he was married to a textile woman. However, after entering the city, the art talent is very much, the skill of Bi ke is far worse. This is probably too exciting to him. He went to Shenyang Northeast Lu Xun Literary Institute to attend school. According to the level of culture, I'm afraid it is difficult to go to college, but he was professionally, after all, confused for a few years, and was definitely ahead of those high school students. At that time, college examinations, art colleges, of course, were different from the current dozens of admissions, so he was given the opportunity to pursue further studies. \\nThis is the image of Gao Mans. How could such people hit the right? Really confused. \\n(4), and Fengming in the book 'experience, my 1957' book recounted by Bi ke\\nExperience-My 1957 is online. With regard to Bi ke, I have reproduced the narrative of Hefengming in 'Experience-My 1957', the original text is reproduced below:\\nWang Zhi met a painter from the Dunhuang Heritage Institute while at the Ming Water Station. This person graduated from the Northeast Lu Xun Institute of Literature and Arts, his love for painting art is better than his love for life. Before they moved from the sandwich groove farm to Mingshui River, leaders arranged, we want to streamline the outfit, only allow to bring covered and carry-on items, the others are not allowed to take away. Bi can violate the regulations, it was hard to bring several of the world's books to the mingshui river, and found a place for his beloved paintings in a narrow nest. Despite the empty stomach, in the time of the time, Bi ke still turned out the big album, God tour in the art hall of famous paintings, enjoy a spirit dinner, until forget everything. \\nBi ke told Wang Zhi that he was the right because he was proud of himself and looked down on Chang Shuhong, director of the Dunhuang Institute of Cultural Relics at that time . Chang Shu Hong already joined the party before 1957, Bi can hit the top of the Chang book, saying not bad, saying what: 'When I participated in the revolution, you didn't know what it was doing!' At the time of the anti-right struggle, Bi could be charged with 'the leader of the opposition party member, Chang Shu Hong, that is, the anti-party leader', and was sent early to Jiuquan Biangou Farm for re-education through labor. Of course, he disobedience, but nothing. On the day of a large increase in the number of dead people, one night, Wang Zhi went to his office, and saw several cadres boiling in a pot on the stove to eat, and only saw several people constantly tearing off paintings from a few thick picture books and stuffed into the hearth as fuel. Wang Zhi recognized at a glance that the ripping was precisely the one that Bi ke loved. He immediately concluded that Bi ke was no longer in the world. Wang Zhi's heart was trembled by hearing the crisp 'hissing' sound from their tearing pages. He felt that the 'hissing' sound was such a sharp and piercing, that he saw the movement of those cadres indiscriminately continue to tear the hands of the drawing pages, suddenly provoked a whim that should cut those hands off. Bi ke is a very respectable friend in his heart. Bi can experience all sorts of unimaginable tribulations in his hard re-education through labor, in the last days of his life, still persist in his love of painting, his great personality force is extraordinary, but his flesh and flesh cannot exceed the limits of human life, he can still only drink and hate away. When he saw as a treasure of art more precious than his life, he lost his life's guardian, he became a fuel for correctional officers to cook soups. \\nMore than 20 years later, Wang Zhi visited Dunhuang Heritage Institute with freedom and met Duan Wenjie, director at this time. During this period, more than 99.98 per cent of the country's original rightists have 'corrected' the rebellion. Wang Zhi could not forget a distant friend, who had long passed away, asked Duan Wenjie about his situation. Duan Wenjie's answer made him greatly surprised him. Duan Wenjie said critically: 'Bi ke is not right at all. We held a solemn memorial conference for him.' Originally, in that year, the Dunhuang Institute of Cultural Relics designated Bi ke as a right-wing element. After a critical struggle, he was urgently and irresistibly declared his dismissal from public office. He was sent to Jiuquan Biangou Farm for re-education through labour as an extreme right. At the same time, it also sent his materials to the relevant authorities of the province for approval. After a few days, the materials sent to the province were returned. The approval documents believed that Bi ke had only serious dissatisfaction with Chang Shu Hong individuals. Its remarks did not yet reach the anti-party anti-socialist nature, and therefore could not be classified as right-wing elements. When the approval arrived in the place, the decision to dispose of Bi ke in the house had long been announced, and Bi ke had long been re-education through labor at the sandwich groove farm for many days. In order to preserve the face of Director Chang Shu Hong, it will be wrong, the approval will be pressed down, and can not be recalled, until Bi can pass through misery and death. He himself does not know that the approval of the province has long given him a pacification. Chang Shuhong as the founder and founder of Dunhuang Heritage Institute, he has long become a world cultural celebrity. But when he ascended the throne of power, he could not tolerate a descendant who spoke uninferior to him-in terms of age and on artistic qualifications, than him. The anti-right struggle in 1957 gave him the opportunity to fully vent and revenge. As director, he was the incarnation of the party's leadership. According to the thinking pattern at that time, the opposition leader, that is, anti-socialism, he gave a little guidance, and he saw himself as a bearer of his eyes, so that a revolutionary seniority earlier than he could become a class enemy, even if he did not get a superior leader. The approval of the guide, he still does not do two endless, will be landed in Jiuquan edge groove farm Bi ke nailed there, so that in 3 Put it to death years later. If it were not 20 years later China had undergone a radical change, the screening and correction of more than 550,000 wronged right-wing elements, the material that was not approved for the right was still sleeping in the file bag. After a few personnel changes, the general population did not know that there was a copy of a copy of the document that could be left in the archive bag. At this time, the director has changed to Duan Wenjie. He was persecuted in the Cultural Revolution, and was particularly serious in reviewing the right-wing grievances of 1957. [3]\\nAnd Fengming's line of '□ □ □' is who, as long as a little know a little bit of Dunhuang's reader, it is not difficult to understand, but, perhaps, I estimate that the author follows the ancient teachings of the Honourable Chun, because this person, now became a world cultural celebrity, won the 'Dunhuang patron god' laurel, debunked him For the country, for Dunhuang, it is not a good thing. \\nHe is Chang Shu Hong. \\n(5), the reason to speculate that Bi ke go to Dunhuang\\nThe question is, after graduating from Shenyang, why should I go to Dunhuang? Now, the author, I, provides a speculation: between 1944-1945, there were three Northeastern people among the painters at the Dunhuang Art Institute. They are Li Bath and Zhou Shaomiao and Umifeng couple. After the victory of the resistance, they returned to Shenyang and taught at Lu Xun Academy of Fine Arts. On July 5, 2001, I went to Shenyang Lu Xun Academy of Fine Arts to visit Li Yu and Mr. Wu Mifeng (Zhou Shaomiao died). I went to interview Chinese American artist Shao Fang who wrote a painting in Dunhuang in 1944. About Chang Shu Hong, the only topic they talked about is that Zhejiang female writer Ye Wenling wrote a literary biography, 'The Patron God of Dunhuang', and did not visit the founders who had participated in Dunhuang's research. It was entirely done by Li Chengxian, who went to Dunhuang in 1946, because This, although Li Chengxian sent a book to them, they all felt that it was not necessary to read. \\nNow to contact Bi ke, I think, the biggest possibility is that Bi ke listened to the introduction of these teachers who had been to Dunhuang at the Luxun Academy of Fine Arts in Shenyang, creating a longing for Dunhuang art. Li Yu studied the history of Dunhuang art. Zhou Shaomiao and Umifeng couple were mural paintings. Their time in Dunhuang was about a year and a half to two years, so talking about Dunhuang, it was not as many Jane, rattle, and moved Beiche to the mysterious cave of Oriental art, creating longing, decided to dedicate. If Bi ke was enrolled in 1952, it should graduate in 1956. If you were enrolled in a college or refresher class, the time would be shorter. Therefore, it was not too long to assign to Dunhuang, and a bucket was planted into the sandwich. \\n(6), Bi ke 1950 leadership, Qingdao Wenlian art group leader Shi Ke said\\nGao Mang said, yes, Bi can know more clearly to count stones. Just don't know whether Shi can now be in Jinan or Qingdao. The next day, she asked that Shi Ke was hospitalized in Jinan, so she went to the hospital to visit the bed-bed stone ke, and contacted me to interview. \\nAbout Shi can, Internet query, learned as follows: Shi Ke (1924-), the word is no, no public, Shandong Zhucheng people. Mandarin College of Library Science is a career. Calligraphy, seal engraving, gold stone, version, according to the study, from archaeologist Wang Xiantang, has joined the China Woodcut Research Association, China Artists Association, and Chinese Calligraphers Association. Large carved mural painting 'Confucius deeds' is long on display in Qufu Confucius Temple Poetry Hall. In 1991, he was awarded the 'China Emerging Printmaking Contribution Award' by China Artists Association and China Printmakers Association, and has published individual prints 'The New Age of the People', 'Lithograph Collection', 'Lu Yan Preliminary Exploration', 'On Language Printing', etc. Vice Chairman of Shandong American Association, director of Shandong Institute of Arts and Crafts. \\nIn short, Shi is a famous artist in the art industry in Shandong. \\nOn the afternoon of May 19, I went to the Shandong Provincial Hospital Ward to interview Mr. Shi Ke. \\nStone can be hospitalized because of pneumosis, long-term bed rest treatment. The disease is mainly dyspnea, which needs to be absorbed oxygen day and night. \\nStone, 78 years old, is troubled by such a disease, is very painful for the body. But when I mentioned this little colleague more than fifty years ago, he was thrilled. This is very taboo for his disease. The doctor and his daughter, constantly persuaded me, after some words slowly say that the conversation should not be too long, cloud cloud. \\nHere is the stone can recall the beike. \\nQingdao was liberated in June 1949. Bi can enter Qingdao from rural areas, assigned to the Wenlian Art Group. The team leader is Shi Ke-after 1952, he was the vice-chairman of the JJV. Without any professional training, from the countryside for the first time into the big city, met such professional skills as stone can be such a deep artist, admired five bodies, so changed its original name to Bi can, in order to show admiration. He sincerely worshiped the stone for the master, and learned from him humbly. Shi Ke is not tired of teaching him, not a teacher, better than a teacher. \\nShi can think that, after learning well, legs and tongue are very diligent, can be flattering, but after all, the culture base is too poor, not widely known, so it is not a spiritual person in art. Art lies in creation, not gourd. \\nAlthough art can be general, but it is from the old liberated area, root miao red, and those from exploitative class, such as stone, he has a sense of hidden inner superiority. Once, stone can bring Jingtao, Bi ke two people, to Cangkou national cotton six factory painting. At that time, the country cotton six factory made a famous female laomo Hao Jianxiu, but it was necessary, the artist went to the factory to paint, was to serve the working class, was combined with workers and reformed ideas. Of course, the factory would not treat them as a guest. They draw until the middle of the night and need rest. The textile factory is full of dust flocks, workers are sloppy, anywhere can sit. Always pay attention to clean stone, find a newspaper, mat sitting on a stool. But wait until you lift the ass for a look, just sitting like Mao Zedong. Bi ke believes that this is an extraordinary issue of political principles that must be reported upwards immediately. Stone, they thought it was late at night and returned to the city with 30 huali, and could wait until the next day to report. The young Bi ke himself returned to the city late at night to report. Fortunately, there were more than a dozen years away from the Cultural Revolution, and the personal worship of Mao Zedong had not developed to the point where he had gone into the magic as it did later. So I listened to the leadership of the report and persuaded Bi ke, there was no need to fuss about this inadvertent error. This thing is finally small, small things, but in the heart of the stone can not erase the memory. \\nLater, Bi can be adjusted to the Palace of Culture, also engaged in fine arts. Wu Jie, director of the Palace of Culture, felt that Bi can learn well, diligent, and he liked it, just met the opportunity to send him to Shenyang Northeast Lu Xun Art Institute. As for a two-year refresher course, or a four-year undergraduate course, I don't know or forget. \\nBi ke was married in Qingdao. The wife is a technician who graduated in spinning. He later went to Dunhuang to work, separated from his wife, thousands of miles apart. The wife went to impossible to arrange a job, probably he could not return to Qingdao. This is probably a key to the conflict with Director Chang Shuhong. \\nBefore liberation, the movement of people was free. The first personnel of the Dunhuang Art Institute, after the victory of the resistance, would also go away, all walked away. But after liberation everything is decided by the organization, it is not easy to transfer into a person. Of course, Chang Shu Hong will not easily let go away. Contradictions are inevitable. Shi can estimate that this is probably the focus of his conflict with Chang Shu Hong. Although the age, qualifications and so on are all under Chang Shu Hong, but there is also a relatively superior 'old revolution' capital. It is entirely possible to say not inferior to the problem of his wife's mobility, the contradictions intensify, and hurt the Changshu Hong. \\nAlthough Chang Shuhong had joined the Party before 1957, holding up the red umbrella, but after all, it was a person from the Kuomintang era, and psychology was very sensitive and fragile. At this time, Chang Shuhong sat in the position of director of Dunhuang for more than a decade. Behind the Communist Party as a backdrop, his wife Li Chengxian is the Party branch secretary. The bureaucratic shelf has been developed. It is absolutely not the humble and peaceful Chang Book Hong in Shao Fangxin in 1944. In contrast, art is not necessarily strong, but in politics a sense of superiority, where will buy the account of Chang Shu Hong, I do not know how to touch which nerve of Chang Shu Hong, and point the death point of Chang Shu Hong, so Chang book hung must be put to death. The anti-right movement coincides with the time. \\n(7), Bi can be in the sandwich groove of the memory of the nest\\nShi Ke, now living in Penglai, the artist Ningli used to live in a ditch and Bi ke in a nest. He is best qualified to testify. \\nNingli is a self-taught artist, famous in Yantai. At the time, when he was the leader of the Eighth Route Army, he went to northeastern Shenyang, where he saw the Soviet Red Army raped women, was angry and fired warning shots, so he was expelled from his party nationality. Later, Tibet was allotted, wanted to turn the case back into the right, and sent to the gutter for re-education through labour. The re-education through labour farm was changed from a labour farm. The sandwich groove re-education farm is just a general term, it includes a number of locations, distributed in a large geographical area. There was a sudden influx of 3,000 right-wing re-education workers, making it difficult to allocate even the simplest houses, many of whom had to live in the nest. The so-called nest is a relatively large underground rock hole, can live two or three people ranging from two to three. Ninli and Bi ke lived in a nest for a year. Then Beko died of starvation, which was buried by Ninli. \\nNingli is 81 years old this year. On the phone, he said repeatedly, it was very bad, and the past was blurred. He wrote a memoirs that he handed over to a friend in Beijing 20 years ago, after which the message was gone, and he didn't even know the whereabouts. \\nThe only thing he remembered was that a starved right-wing was taken to buried by three hard friends. They looked at the deceased's flesh, so the three people negotiated and kneeled together in front of the deceased, flowing tears and said, 'Old man, I'm sorry.' We do not report this world, and the afterworld will give your grace! Three people knocked three heads, and then moved to fire, endure their hearts, ate the only flesh left on this companion, but in the end three of them did not escape the demon of death. \\nIn short, with Ning Li testified, it is more possible to confirm that Bi can be hungry, plus the introduction of Gao Mang, and Fengming, Shi Ke, we can outline a fairly specific outline of Beiche's encounter. According to the case of hitting the right in 1957, as long as the party member leaders who 'attack' or 'oppose' specific units are 'anti-party', they can hit the right. However, the Gansu Provincial Committee 'thinks that Bi ke has serious dissatisfaction with the □ □ □ individuals. Its remarks do not yet reach the anti-socialist nature of anti-party anti-socialism. quality, so can not be defined as 'Rightists', finally showed considerable reason and tolerance. This originally left a living path for Bi ke, but this path was broken in the hands of Chang Shu Hong. \\n(8), Tian high emperor not far\\nI have experienced every political typhoon after liberation, the only fact that, under the leadership of the Communist Party, China cannot find a dead corner, a shelter, or a safe haven. Typhoon always withered, swept over the mighty of thousands of troops, put every gallop to rush. Although Mogao Cave is far from Beijing, but the Emperor Tengao is not far away, can he escape? The problem is that the anti-right movement was a nine-grade earthquake for Mogao Cave, a 12-level typhoon, a massive tsunami. \\nWhen I learned from the lines of the Mogao Cave anti-right movement in some books and publications, it was a surprise. \\n(1), Right Sun Ruqian and Li Qiqiong\\nSun Ruqi, who came to Dunhuang in 1947, and Li Qiqiong, who arrived five years later, were an artist couple. The anti-right movement came in 1957, when the couple were beaten as 'right-wing elements' to control their use. But even with such spiritual burdens, they cannot hold back their passion for art. Li Qiqiong was supervised by labor during the day, and at night she secretly drilled into the cave to study murals, and I forgot two things. After the right hat was removed, Li Qiqiong of the art group continued to put into the mural painting, while Sun Ruqian of the Grotto Protection Group was an active participant in the large-scale maintenance and reinforcement project from 1963-1966. However, at this time, a larger 'Cultural Revolution' storm rolled them into their old hometown of Sichuan. [4]\\n(2), the right history of the encounter of reixiang\\nShi Weixiang and Ouyang Lin are an artist couple who have the same encounter. In 1948 came to Mogao Cave Shi Weixiang, familiar with every murals, every statue, grotto and Buddhist content all in his brain, and was hailed as 'living data', 'living dictionary'. However, it was this 'living dictionary', when the anti-right movement became a 'right-wing,' and after the arrival of the 'Cultural Revolution', he was rushed to the country and put the sheep. [5]\\nWhen the 50th anniversary of the construction of the Dunhuang Research Institute, Shi Weixiang wrote a fervent reminder of the scene of 'Beginning to Mogao Cave': That was September 25, 1948:\\nAt that time, the Dunhuang Art Institute managed the cave area, a total of more than 20 staff. Drift sands floated on a dangerous cliff, like a waterfall, dunes in front of the cave, a bunch of camels and red willows, the lower cave was mostly buried by sand, and the stacks of dangerous rock residues were prematurely ruined, most of the upper cave was to be cleared from Qing Doomarist hired a man to pass through a buried cave, and the strange thing is that despite these broken holes The walls are so ragged, the mural and color sculpture are everywhere, with the alluring charm of art, tempting me to eagerly see the world of art that has been forgotten by human history. \\nWhen Duan Wenjie, Fan Wenzao, Sun Ruqu, Huang Wenfu and Ou Ganglin led me into the grotto for the first time, I was frightened by these ancient mural paintings and color sculptures. If there had been any 'deterrent force' in my life full of three and eight disasters, I had not once When I first saw Mogao Cave, the psychic shock and impulse can be compared. At that time, I quickly recalled how the large copies of mural paintings I saw in Chengdu in 1943 when he served Mr. Zhang Daqian's 'Fulindunhuang murals' exhibition, made me heart. When Mr. Daqian explained Dunhuang mural paintings for me: 'To be a Chinese painter, you must go to Dunhuang', five years later, in the fall of 1948, I finally entered Mogao Cave. I found that what I saw at the exhibition was only one thousandth-one in 10,000, and those superb propositions. It is the art that Mr. Zhang Dagan understood and studied with his deep, wise art. The original appearance of the ocean is in front of my eyes, land mottled, colorful, everywhere the traces of human history, there are also human dreams...\\nAt that time, I just graduated from the art college, and I learned the basic techniques of painting and some preliminary decorative painting principles in five years, as well as a little knowledge of Western art history and aesthetics, was to exchange for 'tickets' to enter the Dunhuang Art Hall. \\nBut as a pilgrim, I finally reached the threshold of this temple. [6]\\nThese young people of Dunhuang art, for Dunhuang art, also for the cause and ideals of Chang Shu Hong, dedicated all the elves that might be dedicated, but they fell into the right abyss in Changshu Hong's couple shop. \\n(3), Duan Wenjie's encounter\\nDuan Wenjie, this man, is too dramatic to Chang Shu Hong. He is the second president of Dunhuang Art Research Institute after Chang Shuhong. \\nIn June 1946, Chang Shuhong sat Fu Sinian looking for Chen Cheng allocated ten wheel big truck, leaving Chongqing. Chang Shuhong wrote in his autobiography: 'The car opened and stopped on the road, and arrived in Lanzhou a month later. At this time, a young man called Duan Wenjie, who helped set up the exhibition when I opened the 'Father and Daughters' Exhibition in Lanzhou. He wants to travel with me to work in Dunhuang. He said he was a graduate of the Chongqing National Arts College and is currently the head of the career introduction unit at Lanzhou Social Service Department. I accepted his request to work in Dunhuang. In Lanzhou, w"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "e reached Dunhuang on the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival in 1946 after a short break and continued to the west. According to my arrangement, Guo Shiqing is in charge of general affairs, his wife Liu Manyun is an accountant, and Duan Wenjie is the head of the art team. [7]\\nThis is the record of Chang Shu Hong for Duan Wenjie, and that's all, but he does not have a word. \\nI really blush for the usual book. Mr. Chang, ah, go here, how can you not express a little, even if only a little apology to Duan Wenjie?! \\nPlease read the narrative of 'Dunhuang Centennial': 'Duan Wenjie and Dunhuang art have been a lifelong relationship with Dunhuang Art since 1944, after seeing Zhang Daqian's mural exhibition in Chongqing. He said goodbye to his hometown's wife, all the way to Dunhuang in 1946. Years later, Duan Wenjie remembers his first arrival at Mogao Cave, still remembers: 'On the eve of Mid-Autumn Festival, the long-awaited Dunhuang was reached. When the car drove into Mogao Cave, the excitement could not be restrained, I jumped off the car and went into the cave, looking greedily, like a hungry cow into the vegetable garden and a full meal.' \\nTen years later, in order to support her husband's cause, the wife of the primary school teacher, came to Mogao Cave with her son from the Tianfu Land of Shanshimizu to teach the children of the Institute staff to study. However, what awaits her is not just a poor life, the ensuing anti-right movement, Duan Wenjie's greater doom is still behind. Together with the Cultural Revolution storm, Duan Wenjie became the first target to be hit. Ten years of separation, 10 years of pain, facing another round of political storms, Longshei-British can no longer support, she suffered from schizophrenia. \\nDuan Wenjie, who was expelled from the Institute, walked to the countryside with his sick wife. Duan Wenjie donated the essence of his own books to the Institute's data room, pulled another part of the books to the scrap purchase point, then rushed to the cattle car, left the road, twists and twists towards the pier bay brigade far on the edge of the Gobi edge. In the next two years, the expert who studied Dunhuang art began his career as a farmer: pulling soil, gasket, pig feeding, making soil fertilizers, haircuts to folks, writing letters, writing slogans in the commune...' [8]\\n'Blood and tears cast Dunhuang' (Wang Jiada), on Duan Wenjie's 'doom' narrative in the anti-right is more detailed: 'The anti-right movement began! His material was quickly reported, and he was about to be pushed forward by the political strong of career men of the 'right'. However, it was not signed on his material. Apart from his opinion on Dunhuang's art, there was little political rhetoric-because his heart was only dressed in Dunhuang. The 'right-wing activities' will not come down, and the incapable children seek other good ideas. He happened to be exposed to a gimmick 'privacy': a chef's wife found a gold ring from his pocket while washing Duan Wenjie. It was paid to him on the eve of liberation and had been dressed in his pocket. He bounced on art and forgot about the existence of this ring. In that particular era, there was a pair of vigilant eyes around. This' anomalous' phenomenon is immediately fed back to the campaign leadership group. Too timely! It cannot be argued that the crime of 'seducing women in the family' has been established. A ready-made 'bad molecule' was worn on Duan Wenjie's head. Disqualified the associate researcher, the salary was reduced to $40, internal control use, and was not allowed to publish articles in his personal name. [9]\\nDuan Wenjie's issue is the key to reverse the right. Duan Wenjie is the 'reception' of talents on the half-way of Chang Shuhong, and he has always loved Dunhuang. He has been working under Chang Shu Hong for 11 years. You often don't know about him yet? In particular, if the right-wing material reported has been rejected, it is too unjustifiable to weave the charges to be 'bad elements'. Who should bear this responsibility? Chang Shu Hong? Li Chengxian? 'The political strong men in the career' and 'low-power children' are clearly implicit in Chang's couple. \\nWhen I first read the story of Galtai: 'That day at the Chungji compound criticized Chang Shu Hong Li Chengxian, I was fighting. Bend your head down and hold your hands back. She (referring to his wife Li Zlin), first came home, and no one was open. Put down the package and see the fight will. I met the art team leader Duan Wenjie pulled Li Chengxian white hair, asked a slapped light. Her name was also mentioned in a list of questions: Why did I pull Lee Zlin, the daughter of the anti-revolutionary, into the house? There is a little doubt about Duan Wenjie's murderous state. Now I know the causes and consequences, it is inevitable to feel sad! For Duan Wenjie, also for Li Chengxian, Chang Shu Hong...' [10]\\nSomeone who has not experienced the Cultural Revolution is no matter how difficult to understand. This is when Duan Wenjie was the second director, Chang Shuhong went to Beijing background. \\nHowever, I think Duan Wenjie's heart and mind is more open. On the 50th anniversary of the Dunhuang Research Institute, he wrote 'Tribute to Mr. Chang Shuhong, the founder of Dunhuang cultural relics,' published in Dunhuang Research, 1994, No. 4, while Chang Book Hong said nothing in the autobiography. Does this also have to be 'left to later people to write'? \\n(IX), the revolution, who revolutionized whose life? \\nAccording to Galtai, during the Cultural Revolution period, there were only 49 people at the Dunhuang Institute of Cultural Relics. Well, there were much fewer people in the anti-right period, including workers. According to policy, workers do not hit the right. Moreover, according to Duan Wenjie, the former staff of the Dunhuang Art Institute insisted on liberation of only 14 people, including only 7 professionals. \\nSo, what are the fate of these seven professionals in the anti-right movement? There can be named names to the right, Sun Ru-Ling, Shi Weixiang and Duan Wenjie three. Li Qiqiong and Bi ke are 'liberation', they are young young people who actively voted for Chang Shu Hong, the veteran of the Institute, the backbone, the key, and the permanent book of Hongfeng, are meritorious leaders. Duan Wenjie did not hit the right, but was beaten as bad elements. Therefore, seven professionals of the 'liberation' advance institute, except for Chang Li couple probably only two did not hit the right. Such right-wing proportions have not been heard of across China. Chang Shu Hong, you actually got this hard heart. \\nThis small unit located in the deserted mountains of Saiwai, it hit the number of right-wing people, its proportion, definitely belongs to the 'upstream' level. You Chang Shu Hong 'participated in' the revolution from the KMT Central Propaganda Minister Zhang Daofan. They are all graduates of art colleges. Who in the end is 'more' the revolution 'more' innocent? It's amazing! \\nThere is almost an iron law for political movements: some leadership with some sort of problem, in order to demonstrate their innocence and revolution, the onset is simply bold and cold! On the contrary, some old and rough, but rather kindness to intellectuals, lighter hands. \\nAbout anti-right, Chang Shu Hong has no words in the autobiography. Not a word, do the best. Falling a piece of white earth is really clean! \\nAlso for this reason, in the autobiography, Chang Shu Hong, for the staff before the victory of the confrontation, there is also the pen involved. However, the main account is that they want to 'hit their homes', rarely recounts their work performance, and the staff situation after the victory of the confrontation is almost unaccounted. It seems that from the establishment of the New Year's Day in 1944, to 'liberation' in 1949, the whole work of the Dunhuang Art Institute was done by Chang Shuhong alone. Chang Shu Hong in the autobiography rarely give credit to his subordinates. In fact, most of the works are the hard work of his subordinates, Chang Shu Hong is learning oil painting, he is not in the line. \\nA director, so greedy, has been dark enough to beat everyone else into the right, so Wang Jiada's article calls him 'a political strong man in his career.' \\nMr. Chang Shuhong tried to show in an autobiography that he was always correct. \\nTo tell the truth, I doubt about Chang Shu Hong's faction for several years. Once on the phone several times asked Mrs. Shao Fang on the side of the ocean. She said that at that time she was busy getting into holes every day, painting, and her colleagues were also very harmonious, beside aspects, there was no understanding. I believe this, because there is faith as proof. \\nPeople are going to keep pace with the times. Chang Shu Hong in 'because of the association, with the wind to get red', really able. \\n(10), Couple and wife, party and government union of the couple shop\\nWe can compare the characteristics of the Dunhuang Art Institute before and after liberation. \\nBefore the 'liberation', there was no party branch here, there was no political movement. People could move freely, two-way choice, come and go freely, so the director seemed 'weak' and was a 'limited' company, so relationships were loose and harmonious. \\nAfter the 'liberation', there have gradually been party members and party branches here, and political movements take place after another, while personnel and units form dependencies, and there is no freedom to escape. Together with this couple, party and government union, the couple shop is in isolation from the desert, but is directly under the central unit. So this 'limited' company, with the change of dynasties, alienated into 'infinite' companies, the independent kingdom in the ravine, and the infinite expansion of power. Absolute power inevitably leads to absolute corruption and the alienation of humanity. \\nBefore 'liberating' 'against' Chang Shu Hong, there was nothing remarkable. When a big deal went away, that Zhang Minquan turned his face away. After 'liberation', 'against' Chang Shuhong to go on the line became an 'anti-party', not only do not take off, but also ask you to wear small shoes and high caps. By 1957, the longest employees working with him were 11 years, such as Duan Wenjie. Pots, pans, pans, pans, can't knock After the 'liberation', Chang Shu Hong step into the big red people, also step by step away from the masses, waiting for the 'big Ming to enlarge', it became the target of the public. \\nChang Shu Hong, before the 'liberation', did not have absolute power, did not have a single party branch, nor the need for political movements, so he could not do whatever he wanted to his subordinates. After 'liberation' he gained absolute power, the more and more aperture on his head, the more and more dazzling, giving him absolute power. Absolute power is to erode the personality of the personality. Plus they are couple files, party and political union, I do not know if the couple sings, or the couple singing together, or oboed unison. This increases their freedom of freedom to exercise their feet, without an internal or external force that can counterbalance power to cushion the shock of contradictions. They also end up getting deeper in the magic trap of absolute power without consciousness. Woe! \\nWhen Chang Shu Hong wrote an autobiography, already more than ten years after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, history has been reversed, especially in the 80's public opinion still had considerable space for freedom, and the atmosphere for reflection was still relatively strong, but Chang book Hong himself did not have the slightest sense of self-reflection. This may be one of the reasons or reasons why, in autobiography, nothing to say about the Decade of Cultural Revolution. He left the masses into this field, and still wants to rely on the 'Central' to save his reputation and face, it is too unclear to himself. \\nPeople like the Sun era should, of course, abandon, but their own accounts have to be counted. There is no repentance in conscience, no reproach, no guilt clear, still to show that three faithful and such fools are honorable, so there is no 'home' sad. \\nWhy did he insist on returning to Dunhuang? Or for the face, a layer of Banbeth oil painting face, to make up the face of the self-biography title called 'Dunhuang 50 years'. \\nChang Shu Hong from reaching Dunhuang in 1943, until April 1972 with Han Suying Tour Dunhuang, before and after the time in Dunhuang full intentions for 29 years, then probably Dunhuang is not his 'home', because Dunhuang's 'two factions' masses stubbornly oppose him back to Dunhuang. The last regret of Chang Shuhong was to rest in Beijing, not in Dunhuang. \\nAfter 40 years of transformation, Chang Shu Hong is indeed 'reborn', took off the 'bourgeois' tire, changed the bone of the 'proletarian', 'as an old generation of intellectuals but because of the common book, the wind becomes red.' (11), But the loss is normal personality and healthy fetal bone. \\nThose who have experienced the Cultural Revolution know that a situation where the leadership was rejected by both factions of the unit in the end is such a rare case. Usually it is a pie, a pie leather. Both factions are leather, leather in the end, this example is less. We cannot overhang the situation in Dunhuang. Is it unreasonable for the masses or whether Chang Li's couple offended the masses too much. \\nI can't see Chang Shu Hong is a cynical speculative good at drilling camp cynicism. \\nHe belongs to the kind of fidelity who is committed to three faithful love to death first shouting 'Long live' book full of fool. \\n(11), Chang Shu Hong sandwiched tail big tart\\nI had the privilege of reading the letter Shao Fang wrote in Dunhuang. I only felt that Chang Shu Hong at that time was an approachable, compassionate, confessed, unscrupulous leader and director. So despite the difficult life, my colleagues all live in harmony, care for each other, love each other, and like a family. But after the liberation, Chang Shu Hong himself hang a string. He himself became the object that must be transformed. As a leader like him from the 'old society', with the Kuomintang regime, he must be careful and careful, with the heart, the whole person and survival, become the two sides of a coin. He can only choose between the whole person and survival. \\nLike Bi ke, a young person with some revolutionary capital, we estimate that he will not buy a debt on Chang Shu Hong, so Chang Shu Hong feels that he is a threat to his own survival. Using the anti-right movement, hostage a private attack, he will want to leave the ground of death. Otherwise, when the Gansu Provincial Committee has refused to approve him as the right, why not take him from him from the Gansu Provincial Committee after it has refused to approve him as the right. Clip back? In the anti-right movement, some leaders, in fact, hold their own tail of a historical problem, and the reason why some leaders add left to the left and the big tart. He was hesitant and afraid that others would uncover his historical tail by hitting on the right to more and better. The situation of Chang Shu Hong is not extremely isolated and has a certain representation. In every political movement, there is such a group of leaders and activists to highlight their 'revolution' in an extremely left-leaning manner. These speculative fake revolutionary pseudo-revolutionary feet on the political corpses of their upright companions on the podium and gracefully held party ticket officers to shake the city, selling obedient everywhere, so I'm not excited! \\nChang Shu Hong wrote an autobiography. His timid heart beats under the pen, so he wants to exert his favor on the leaders of the new masters up and down, to try to distort everything in the Kuomintang era, and try to confess himself with their antagonistic relationship, and also a innocence of himself. This is probably Chang Shu Hong to leave an autobiography at the bottom of the secret. \\nWe read his autobiography and should read it upside down before it is possible to spy on the facts. In fact, such biography is now full of workshops, Chang Shu Hong's autobiography is just one of them! Those who rely on autobiographies to study history should be careful not to miserse and destroy endless harm. To study the history of Dunhuang, Chang Shu Hong's autobiography is one of the most misleading materials. \\nI read Chang Shu Hong and write Chang Shu Hong, actually dissecting an intellectuals to the process of alienation of humanity. He is just one of the thousands of regular books. \\nClass struggles, ideological transformation, political movements are the source of all evil! \\nAh Tolstoy, in the title of the Second 'History of Suffering,' 1918, described the difficulty of reforming thinking with 'three times in water, bath three times in blood, three times in alkaline water'. Chang Shu Hong is the taste of water, blood, alkali water have been tasted, after more than 40 years, finally wearing a laurel enough to show off, is actually a spiritual shackle, so when he bid farewell to the world, he did not liberate himself, did not stretch bones, did not stand up, still with a timid Feeling heart, it can not help but be confused! \\nI remember 50 years ago, Guo Lanying sang the red song, 'Old society turns people into ghosts, new society turns ghosts into people.' Looking back at these 50 years of new society, it is really a drama, comedy, and tragedy of 'turning people into ghosts.' \\nI take the liberty of saying, as painters artifacts everyone Dunhuang patron God, Chang Shu Hong is a success, eternal immortal, but as the personality of intellectuals, 'fight the old bone Mei Duke', he defeated! \\n(12), 'brainwashing exercise' perspective\\nChang Shu Hong is already an ancient man. For the ancient seniors, the author's above discussion, quite unreasonable. But Chang Shu Hong can be described as a model of excellence in the transformation of ideas. Through his case, you can once again see the goals pursued by the 'brainwashing movement', living embodied in his 'this one' body. So we can see that the human personality of a generation of intellectuals is distorted and alienated! \\nSo there is cynicism to Mr. Chang, please forgive Mr. underground. \\nWhat is intellectuals? Meng Zi said, He who does not learn and is able, and his good power; and those who do not care about knowing, their conscience is also. (12), The nature of the intellectuals is to have a good conscience, lost conscience, just like the proposition of 'white horse horse', not intellectuals. The process of 'brainwashing' is the process of gradually extinguishing the conscience of intellectuals, and the Cultural Revolution has reached the point of attraction. However, we opened the autobiography, it was after the Cultural Revolution that Chang Shuhong had the award of frequent group photos with party and state leaders, and had frequent visits or greeted your photos at the international level, so we also covered the wounds of the mind, and all lost things were doubled, beautiful! \\nMeng Zi said: 'Living in the world, standing in the world, the road of the world. Won it, with the people; not to do it alone. Rich can not be good, poor and destitute can not move, mighty can not yield, this is a great husband.' (13), Looking at the land of China today, where can I find the 'big husband'? \\n[Note]\\n(1), 'Dunhuang next to the black tombstone' written by Xu Baike reporter of China Youth Daily\\n(2)-(9), Wang Jiada 'Blood and tears cast Dunhuang' and Fengming 'experience, my 1957'\\n(4), (5), (8), 'Dunhuang Centennial-The History of a National Mind', by Liu Shiping, Meng Xianshi, Guangdong Education Press\\n(6), Dunhuang Studies, No. 2, 1992\\n(7), Fifty Years of Dunhuang, Changshu Hong, Gansu Culture Publishing House\\n(10), Gaertai 'looking for home-sky and earth white'\\n(11), Li Tinghua 'Dunhuang Anecdote-Wang Ziyun, Zhang Daqian, Chang Shuhong'\\n(12), 'Meng Zi · Dedicated'\\n(13), 'under Meng Zi Teng Wen Gong'\\nPAGE 17"}

According to the materials released at the 19th meeting of the Geomagnetic Geophysical Exploration and Administrative Unit, and the large print newspaper on the 19th, are as follows:\\n(a), hate party, hate socialism\\n1, Bivenda said: 'Before liberation my family was rich, now poor.' And he said, 'Whosoever says that life has improved, my life will not improve.' \\nNote: The families of Bivenda before liberation were capitalists. \\n2. Bivenda said: 'The Party does not understand science, the party holds power, why Chinese science does not develop, the reason is that scientists do not lead science.' \\n3, Yang Chunrong said: 'I made some mistakes before, meeting dare not daring to speak.' Behold said, I was more serious than you in the fight against me, but I did not give in. \\nNote: Bivenda is the object of opposition in the fight against. \\n4, Bi wenda said: 'I will not join the party, not the party is the same, if Guo Mo is not a party member, the position is not lower than who.' \\nBi also said: 'After admission to college, strive for the first two years to join the party, after two years to drill down homework.' \\n(2), carved hatred of party leaders, party members and activists\\n1, Bivenda said: 'The head of the authority is in the hands of the director.' I said, 'We are all tails anyway, the leader is called to go east, you dare not westbound.' But he said, No! The leader is the fox head, the cadre is the tail...'\\n(Yang Chunrong, etc.)\\n2, Bivenda said: 'boldly on all the leaders who have dealt with, old hope can not do big things, small things are not willing to do, is it not to put old qualifications, said polite transfer, do not ask him to go home.' \\n3, sometimes because of the need for work, have to deal with the leadership, often gas, Bi said to Yang Chunrong: 'All big and small leaders, by the superior gas, naturally vent to our trainees.' \\n4, in the big print, to × × to see each other abusive phenomenon, so bad, to write a big print, want everyone to sit down, but Bi wenda immediately drilled the empty space, and said: 'Small to you invite the symposium, come with us well, do not beat these horse fart, We can't mention our opinions.' \\n(iii), Commending the Yugoslav social system\\n1, several times in front of the old small building, Bivenda asked about the situation of our factory and said to me: 'Xiao Xiang, I think Yugoslavia has a lot of places where we can learn... factories have workers' committees... all the problems are handled by the workers' committee... see who will make money is their own, the country only takes it 40%, they can say that their workers live very well, that's really working class Owner.' \\n2, he added: 'Stalin has done a very bad job on the Yugoslav issue, that is, the Soviet Union is like him, Yugoslavia is still very good today. I admire Yugoslavia has cowhide (meaning that there is a kind of gas and courage), and he does not want any socialist camp, also go socialism.' \\nIn early June, Bivenda said to me: 'In the whole wind, a party member stood in a fair position to report how the party organization suppressed the masses, blows, he (referring to the so-called intifada party member), helped the party do not know how much sorry the masses, framed a lot of masses...'\\n4. After Chairman Mao proposed 'one hundred contests', most of the Party Central Committee did not approve, and withdrew on the spot. \\n5. Lin Xiling made a speech at Peking University, saying that Hu Feng is not a counter-revolution, and that there is evidence from the Supreme People's Procuratorate. \\n6, Tan Tianrong and other places to go to activities in Tianjin, the cover is also sold, young people disregard all the courage. \\n7, Bivenda said: 'The Party Central Committee borrowed the whole wind signboard anti-right, it is both the whole wind and why must it be anti-right. Why should I chase the history of people, is it not deformed?' \\n8. Bivenda said: 'The articles of the people's daily workers and farmers are only individual, high-income, uninformed workers and farmers. In fact, farmers in rural areas have very little income, and workers who earn 20 yuan in the factory have very opinions.' \\n(iv), Incitement in the whole wind movement, taking advantage of the opportunity to achieve anti-socialist aims\\nDuring the whole windy period, Bivenda, under the banner of 'helping the party to wind up', sparked reactionary fallacies, ignited everywhere, and organized a small anti-socialist group of anti-party anti-socialist groups to take advantage of the wind and carry out untold secret activities in order to achieve his shameful criminal purpose, and for several days in the administration of geomagnetic and geophysical exploration The group meeting of the factory was very outraged, except for Bivenda's reactionary fallacy Strict denunciation, also revealed a large number of materials, we were revealed on the 19th of the material finishing published, and now the 20 day revealed the material as follows:\\n1, inciting and preparing for 'rebellion'\\nZhu, Li and others expose that: Bivenda preached the rightist man Lin Xiling's remarks everywhere, spreading the reactionary fallacy that Hu Feng is not a counter-revolutionary reactionary fallacy, saying that there is 'legal basis' and 'evidence from the Supreme Procurator's Office.' \\nHuang expose: Bivenda is very discouraged by the rebellion. He was pleased to see the newspaper put forward the 'rebellion'. He wrote a 20-page written opinion to the head of the office, playing with words, saying that he could erase (accusing anti-China criminal activities), what legal issues he mentioned in the Free Forum, and he said that he violated human rights, that is Eradicate yourself and indicate that there are human rights violations in the fight against them. The man who gave him advice in the fight against him was hated. \\nHuang Exposed: During the wind, Bivenda said he was an activist, and said: True and false activists are now exposed. \\n2. Bivenda's political ambitions\\nBivenda said: 'Politics are more difficult, it's done bad.' \\nAfter the announcement of anti-party incidents such as Marinkov in the Soviet Union, Bi said: 'Political ambition is not good now.' \\n3, to the party attack madness and arrogance\\nBi said: I wrote the big letter for a breath, I prepared three not: one not to join the party, two do not raise wages, three do not improve. \\nBivenda falsified rumors, he once said: 'The geophysical wind movement is driven by the big print, and the usual active party members, why is it not active now.' \\nIII. Hate parties, hate activists\\n1. After the anti-party anti-social remarks discussed in the afternoon of the 13th, the panel discussion unanimously wrote a big letter to declare Chen Yuyan... Bi wrote the following reactionary poems at this time:\\nTs'iyi\\nMay yellow mildew day\\nCrooked wind and dark clouds flying around\\nColor paper red and green, discouraged\\nEvery battle, that can be true\\nMake a hilarious\\nCast a big print. \\nIf sailing smoothly\\nDainguchi\\nI have a point.\\nCh'ieh\\nJune Sunny Photo\\nThe right shocked. \\nStick Kicking Chan Bone\\nSpring mind, prepare early. \\n(5), The anti-socialist small anti-socialist group completely exposed that Bivenda is the leader of the small group\\nAfter the criticism of four group meetings of geomagnetic, geophysical and administrative factories, the small anti-socialist anti-socialist group created by Bivenda on the 24th has been completely exposed, proving that the activities of the small group were planned and guided by Bivenda. The material revealed by the public on the 20th meeting is as follows:\\n1. The Party proposed a whole wind, and Bivenda thinks that the time has come to incite, pull up and seek sympathy everywhere to create conditions for the organization of anti-party anti-socialist small groups:\\nDu, Zhu and others expose: Bivenda shaved his hair after the counter, expressed dissatisfaction with the reality, and later pretended to work actively and spread around. Other comrades in the geomagnetic instrument group were not as good as their own remarks, saying that this work was not successful, then the work was not active, and said, 'How good in politics in his work, that is, Report it to Jiang Boqin. In order to obtain the goodwill of others for him, on the other hand, to publicize how hard one's life is, how difficult the family is, to seek sympathy and incite dissatisfaction with the leadership. In fact, this fallacy has once anesthesized a minority of the masses, some say that after five years 'there is no credit and hard work'. In addition, they spread rebellious speech among the masses. He said: 'The fight against the counter is simply wrong, there is no material, and the battle has not been concluded for a long time.' 'I wrote 36 opinions to the head of the office to write off (meaning to resist the crimes reported in the rebellion),' Bivenda was delighted after the party raised the wind, saying, 'This is a unique opportunity for a lifetime.' In the future, similar to the above mentioned criminal activities to incite discontent with the Party and seek compassion, he said, the purpose of these words is to make comrades who do not understand Bivenda's 'goods' on the one hand, lose vigilance about their true face; on the other hand, cause 'life suffering' to Bivenda in the minds of others, the work volume Very low wage levels, struggle for compassion, discontent with the party's leadership, some of these people become small groups Members. Others who have the same 'encounter' as Bivenda, of course, are like-minded. \\n2, in the first burning of poison, reactionary flame arrogant. \\n(According to Yang, Du, Huang, etc.), After Peking University and Welfare Lou posted large print newspaper, Bi thinks that the time has come, 'to open the situation' with excitement. 'We must first open a gap in the geomagnetic group'. 'To pre-emptive, this artillery should be hit before the deputy director of defense mobilization report.' 'Before organizing the first batch of big print newspapers, Bi wenda and Cheng Hongsheng negotiated: 'I (referring to Bi wenda himself), captured Du, Zhu and Geomagnetic Station.' It can be seen that they had long divided their labor. On the evening of the day when the big print was posted in the welfare building, Bivenda instigated to 'raise opinions' to the party on the third floor. \\nUnder the slogan of 'Open the situation' and 'pre-emptive,' the big print was posted on the next night; the main members of the administration were five; in fact, the anti-socialist group of anti-party anti-socialist groups had been formed at that time, and Bivenda said: 'After this big print there are a few more people'. 'More people will be more powerful'. This illustrates also the intention to expand the organization and impact. \\nBivenda was the main role in this event. He himself wrote four or five large print newspapers. Among them, there were attacks on the editorial board, saying that the editorial board had decided that individual editorial committee songde, these people should not participate in the editorial board. One article was about the deputy director of administration, and did not come out. It is also very good, but not sharp enough. For those manuscripts that are not strong, the majority of manuscripts have to be modified in person, and change it to 'it is very powerful to hit the point'. Bi thinks should be posted before the afternoon off work, because we can see early, another 'pre-emptive, not laid out in the place after the whole wind'. \\nPosting guests in the big print newspaper, where the evil evil rises, Bi encouraged everyone to say: 'The big print pushed the sounding', 'pushed the whole wind'. \\nBivenda in the big print newspaper proposed that the editorial committee is defined. To sing the step down of Songde (referring to party member Zhang Mingda), is aimed at seizing the power of editorial committee. When he achieved his goal as the editorial committee, he said more complacently: 'This year I have been going smoothly, the masses want me to come to power'. He used the editorial authority to find people everywhere. 'Give advice' to the party, especially 'to find people who are dissatisfied with the right leadership to the party 'Comment', others will not write, 'enthusiastic editorial committee' can write, before and after being incite in more than 14 people. \\nOne day before the first free forum, I (Cheng), said to Bivenda: 'We do this wrong, change is good to change.' Bivenda said, 'Do you want both sides?' It means that I am determined to work with him, which is his determination to consolidate the performance of the small group. Bi later proposed to combat all 'bureaucratic guardians' and 'horse-fart' (all those who defend justice), slogans. Under this slogan, they collectively attacked Luck, the truth, Yang Huifen, and Mrs. Schedar and others. \\n3, planned to capture the position of the proposal group representative, (according to Cheng Hongsheng, Zhu Lian expose)\\nAt the time of presenting the review team for the organization proposal, Bivenda Hecheng has determined in advance in the office. Since Bivenda wants to prepare for 'rebellion' and solve the problem of his own level and low salary, he wants to engage in personnel issues, and to engage in life welfare issues, and to work in the group, when meeting discussions, Cheng said: 'Don't be noisy, we have already negotiated.' They (Bi, Cheng), systematically steal the position in order to achieve those untold purposes. \\n4, the organization retreated (according to Wang Genfang, Huang He-ling, Comrade Yang Chunrong's exposure)\\nIn the fight against the right, Bi wenda and other organizations retreated. They (Bi wenda, Cheng Hongsheng), first spread 'Party world' in the group meeting... and other reactionary fallacies are not a matter of position, but simply look at the 'one-sided nature' of the problem and 'did not pay attention to reading the newspaper.' At the same time, Bivenda exhausted its despicable and shameless methods, and the aim is not only to make Wang succumbed to him, but also from here can get 30 yuan to snow old hate (because Wang in the fight against Bivenda). \\nComrade Yang denounced: Bivenda saw the anti-right start and the situation was wrong. He said to me, 'I want to commit suicide, the location is Tsinghuayuan Station. I have already found a path from the station where I arrived. As long as the train flute rings, it takes a few minutes to run to the station, and I want to commit suicide on the day. 'I take a stop watch and run as soon as I hear the whistle,' he said to me several times, 'You put Lang head to kill me, beforehand I write a certificate for you, do not take responsibility for you.' Bivenda's extremely despicable hooliganism is simply trying to threaten me not to expose his anti-party behavior, but I know whether or not, and I want to fight resolutely. \\n(6), After the struggle of four consortia Bivenda refused to confess, oath to defy and resist, with no intention\\nBivenda put his historically anti-socialist anti-socialist rhetoric on a small hat of 'others say so I followed', 'liberalism,' and 'individualism,' without mentioning the first-class hatred of his anti-socialist ideology. Thought of all kinds of soft resistance, rogue has been extremely tactics to confront the masses. Even witness and physical evidence are in front of them, or do not recognize their anti-party anti-socialist position. He wrote a literal 'review' book, all of which was publicly exposed by the public, and negated the key issues in the material. Bi himself did not have any account.

In another big print, 'You (referring to members of the Communist Party of China), also blow some light rain, lest it be too dry.' '× Governor's lover is 'fat lady''. '× deputy director die not face', 'do not curse not addicted'. 'To release the accumulation of years of stuffiness.' 'I mean let everyone see this is the Communist Party.' 'The party branch of the hospital does not understand the business, the level is not high, it can not be convince people, it does not work.'

(The relationship between Dean Miao and the staff is), 'factory owners to workers' and 'landlords to slaves'; saying, 'joining the party will be subject to ideological restraint.' 'Who removed the post of deputy governor I first raised my hand in favor.' 'Some of their remarks (fingers, stores, Luo, etc.), have a factual basis, and I agree, such as Zhang Bojun said, 'There is a thing for the State Council to take finished products for advice, and the branch of the (CPC), branch is to get people to lift their fist, that is, passed. Ge Pei Qi said: the overall purchase and sales were messed up There is a problem with the overall purchase and sale, Shanxi is not good, these are the facts, and we should appreciate the spirit and essence of the people. Like Zhu Anping said: Every unit has a party member, I think the fact is also the same, such as the school is always a party member, school and party committee leader...' 'According to my view, the Party newspaper should not have a position, what is said, what is there, and should not use big headlines to reverse the right, so Talking is not also closed. In my words, there is a change, no exemption, we should ask you to give opinions, and we want everyone to fight. Daming was proposed by the Party. In order to wind up, the party could raise all the different opinions during the wind, but don't come to a conclusion, because someone just watched the party's eyes go, so that the party should stand in the position of a third party, and should not use big print headings against the right, this is the party's narrow mind, giving people Home Bo guolongckle Hats Obviously a little bit of it.' 'I am not in favor of learning Marxism, but I share the Marxinist worldview. This aspect of social science is not needed for us to learn natural sciences, but to waste time in vain and not solve real problems. Learning Pavlov doctrine is tantamount to learning Marxism. If the Soviet Union has Pavlov, China has Lu Xun, they are not party members and do not learn Marxism, but they are recognized Marxinists; do not the scientific arguments of non-party scientists Newton and others serve the people the same? So people who learn politics are not necessarily better than business science, but only people who love science can learn business well. I'm not interested in Marxinism at all, a headache at a glance, this is a matter of personal interest. Marxism-Leninism is part of the social sciences. It is not possible to learn from natural scientists. Chairman Mao agrees with me. To learn good business today is politics, doing a good job is to serve the people, and to be able to diagnose a good illness is to master Marxinism. Political study time should be combined with science and business learning to discuss death cases, and this is politics in itself. Hospital party members do not work because they don't understand business, so they can't lead the business'. Wait, hit the right."}

The backbone of the right-wing group, in addition to communicating their own problems, revealed some facts about anti-party activities. Only part of the material has been extracted here to make readers more aware of the ugly faces and despicable aims of the anti-party, anti-socialist, and sabotaging national unity groups from their internal blurbs. The text in parentheses without 'note' is added by the author himself.] \\nArabian Reveals Bo lin (1957.9.20)\\nIn the winter of 1952, Bo lin often said in the masses, 'When the autonomous region was established, the chairman asked me who would be better to elect the district governor? At a time when I saw no one in the Dalu cadres, Wu Weirong is not suitable for the years. Although not, Mangha is stronger than Wu Weirong, young people have better training and prospects, so that they chose the vast ha'. The air created among the masses was that 'Bo lin is only his head in the Daqu, not simple, and worked with the Chairman to study and consult with the chairman', 'the governor was chosen by Bo lin.' But said he could not, very euphemingly add a sentence: 'No, it has already been chosen, understand him (refers to the vast ha), young people do not understand what.' (When some young cadres were unhappy with Manha, he said this.), \\nAnd he preached himself 'to work hard for the nation,' said: 'When the autonomous region was established, I gave all the preparatory work. It took two months in advance to investigate the population, Daqu economy, culture, beliefs, customs, life, ethnic history, etc., and ran away from the east. It took me a lot of effort to get sick. For the sake of the nation, it will be a little tired. The preparatory work for the autonomous region was all I personally prepared. The central delegation came, and nothing was prepared (refers to the vast ha). Even Hanbo dance performed, I personally gave it by myself. What is there, no one, Baan ha youth do not understand anything, no matter, no matter, no way, for the sake of the nation, you have to do it yourself.' This caused the masses to be scorn and discontent with Baan Ha, and towards Bo lin formed 'for the sake of the nation, without relentless laboring and suffering disease, national enthusiasm, really caring for the nation, are good minds.' This is an impression. So individuals reflect that 'Mangha really has no conscience, without Bling and Morgen, can he be the governor? Now bragging what cattle.' (Ortai, Ao widow and some young cadres, students say so, 1955, 1953.), (Single-chapter Paul said: 'The Autonomous Region is Morgen's credit, but can Morgen this district be established for you? (Also said Morgen is bad.), In 1956 reclining cattle spit symposium, color heat, Agu said: 'Bo lin does not choose Baan Ha to be the district governor? Be the dog! Now come to the whole Bo lin and say that Bo lin instigated autonomy is really unconsciously!' Color hot said: 'Autonomous Region was founded, Morgen credit, Bo lin credit.' Zhang Bao said: 'The establishment of the autonomous region is the fruit of the popular struggle in Haratun. How much has Morgen suffered for the sake of the nation, the vast ha is now the head of the district and said Morgen is not good.' \\nAccording to the propaganda propaganda of ethnic high school Dalu students returning to their hometown, Bo lin is the most concerned about the nation. Some students called 'Ethnic enthusiasm' said this way, 'Teacher Bu is particularly enthusiastic about the nation. Students in difficulty cannot afford to read a book to go home. Teacher Bu went to the Department of Education to ask for grants, and especially often ask whether there is any difficulty.' \\nIn this way, Bo lin has won the glorification of a few, confused the masses and closes the hearts of the people. So Bo lin became the so-called 'head of the nation, the head of the nation' in the right-wing group. Color heat, Agu, Wu Wensheng publicly declared the masses: 'Bo lin is the leader of our Da ethnic group.' This member, the director, and the people's deputies have all come out. \\nProvoking the relationship between leaders and being led, saying: 'The vast ha is strong organizational. This is an advantage, but it is out of the masses (Note: out of the group of 'masses'). The people do not support it. Provincial and municipal leaders simply know that love cadres do not know education cadres, love cadres are good, but do not criticize and do not educate Baha, let The cadres were out of the masses, and the result was to hurt the cadres After making such a distortion of cadre policy, add provocation and provocation: 'The provincial leaders said Mangha good, loyal, listened to the Party's words, and said Wu Weirong's personal heroism, not listening to the Party's words.' Bo lin took the opportunity to get rid of the district governor of Manha. On the evening of April 14, 1957, Bo lin said: 'When the suburbs were set up, the masses did not support the vast ha, they would have to replace Baan ha. I proposed to replace the list of candidates.' \\nFrom January to June 1957, Bulin correcting suburban cadres carried out illegal self-government activities. Bulin has addressed the suburbs Wu Weirong, Selge, Agu, He Yu, Agu, Russia, and E Zhonghua and others. Bo lin took advantage of the individualism, personal heroism, and narrowly nationalist ideas of these people to foment. How did he confuse the inciting? Now it looks like there are three ways: ① hold, excitement, pick the way. The method he used most often for these people is this method, saying, 'You are very enthusiastic about the nation,' 'you have a lot of research on the history of the nation', this is a positive look; 'Dregher's most active, a crooked head, insist on the end', 'Su Rong Zabu is more active, theoretical level is not seductive.' This is an excitement method; 'The Moqida people all cursed us Heilongjiang not asking for autonomy. We should actively ask for it.' 'Inner Mongolia cadres all cursed us in Heilongjiang that they didn't stand on both sides,' this is a radical approach; pick up and say, 'I mentioned your list in the province, and one person did not agree.' Especially for the relationship between the party group, leadership and being led, said: 'Provincial leaders say Loyalty and listen to the Party's words.' 'Wu Weirong's personal heroism, does not listen to the Party's words.' (Color heat, Agu and others also used this method to say: 'Minister Zhang said E Yingshou is behind, saying you (refers to the Arab and Russian), masses tail.'), '□□ Tun Party members □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ Using a person to Baan ha, the party's dissatisfaction with the party and said, 'Behind the vast ha to engage me, said I incited, the vast ha is not hard, timid.' 'The leaders of Heilongjiang Province and Inner Mongolia have a basic style, do not want to give us the ethnic autonomy, and the masses ask you why don't you give autonomy?' and so on. Got people's sympathetic support for him, and create grievances of cadres and masses towards the party. ② Give you an opportunity to try to get you to the national symposium and the text symposium called the so-called 'representative' approach. If he made use of the nominal status of the Provincial Civil Affairs Committee, the Communist Commission, and the Talent Work Committee to preach autonomy, Wu Weirong and I and Agu to participate in the provincial ethnic symposium. These people are grateful to him and can be used to serve his self-government activities as their helpers. This is his most popular approach, and his best way. ③ The last one is the 'Sealing Officer Wish', 'You have a lot of research on language, change to the language work committee to study language science. People like you have research are not, there are few, and now people are missing, you can play a corner.' (No post said.), (In 1957 Spring Festival, May Ward colloquium said so to me.), This makes it easier for him to harness to use as a helper. If you do not ask for autonomy, he cannot allow representation or study the text, which has never been mentioned in the past, this time for the purpose of self-government activities. \\nHow did Bo lin use these methods? He is using the following 5 points to confuse to incite: ① Mo Qi people congress proposed the autonomous state plan, has already gone to the central post, let us Heilongjiang unanimously ask for and support, unify the idea, put our suburbs into an autonomous county into the autonomous prefecture to go inside, otherwise not be included. This thing is reasonable and legitimate, so that people participate in his self-government activities. ② fabricated: 'Central (Xia Furen), Province (secretary Ouyang Qin), the leadership replied so, there are words (see writing the original words). Let's work just about one more force.' ③ 'The Central United Front Department will convene a national United Front Department conference and a national symposium on ethnic issues to solve ethnic issues. We must arrange the reunification of ethnic issues, and we will have to be arranged in the first year of the second 5-year plan. Now we do not actively ask, we cannot give autonomy in the future, and it is not easy to ask. So we actively ask that we can arrange the issue of national autonomy inside.' ④ 'How can the text be implemented without an autonomous organ? Is there no autonomous organ without words? No autonomous organs want text to use? Therefore, now, it will be possible to resolve the autonomous organs first, and how to solve them internally after the text.' ⑤ 'People everywhere demand autonomy. In particular, the Inner Monda people are most actively demanding that the Inner Monda cadres are more active and unanimously demanded the autonomous prefectures. We should now actively ask for it. Otherwise, the Nemenda people said we were, we could not pull back. In the future, there will be a Daqu Daily. Prepare now, that is, lack of people and printing machines. If an autonomous organ is set up, it would be nice to set up a newspaper in Qi City.' (He also said at the time, 'Inner Mongolia's opinion, let me be the editor in chief, can I do it?'), (Wu Weirong, Color Heat, Agu, DeYuhai and others seem to also say that they are going to do a newspaper and are ready to set up a daily newspaper. This is now blurred.), Bo lin used these things to confuse the minds of these people in advocating autonomy and fomenting it. \\nBo lin's self-government activities are not only encouraging self-government, but also pervasive, sometimes actively creating opportunities to hold colloquiums openly and legally, to organize colloquiums on behalf of the Civic Committee, and want to use all opportunities openly and secretly to engage in conversation, exchange, talk, talk, and solicit opinions individually etc., and organize large mass congresses for propaganda. As far as I know, there are the following activities:\\n1. In 1957, at the beginning of the Spring Festival around the tenth, in his house the same color hot, Deyuhai, Hu and others secretly talked about autonomy. According to the time I went to catch up, the color heat, DeYuhai said: 'Dragher came here by the Hailar (i.e., the Bolinghouse), to talk about the autonomy issue, just walked, probably coming to the railway station, and went back to Moqi.' Talk about what did not say. Only mentioned that 'Moqi mentioned the autonomy plan, asked us Heilongjiang to unanimously ask for support.' (At that time, I also suggested that the state should be transferred to Heilongjiang leaders.), This is the first time I started catching up with this group event. (Note: He is never the first time.), At that time, Bo lin also said the same thing, 'last year we want to make a little effort, what the autonomous county could have given.' \\nAccording to the three men of Seerre, De Yuhai, Hu and the three men: They came up from the district. um, I considered that I must have talked with Wu Weirong and Blind later. They claim to go to Jiangbei for New Year's New Year. 'New Year New Year' is the name. Actual German and Hu went to Jiangbei to incite the use of Latin characters to go. Color heat may be directed by Wu Weirong to instigate autonomy in the area of Hara. But the situation is not known. \\nIn this conversation, color heat proposed to carry out internal struggles, I propose isolation. And Bo lin used a two-sided approach to saying, 'The struggle, no need for everything, should strengthen unity. All are differences of opinion.' \\n2. In early May 1957, when I went to Voshiyang and I went, Bo lin raised the question of autonomy: 'Do we ask the autonomous prefecture to be good, or the autonomous county is good? Or are they required? Ask for that first?' I said, 'All ask, solve the county first.' Wo Shiyang said: 'County does not demand, Qi city can not put it, there is an autonomous prefecture on the line, put Mo, Buu, A, and Eqi one state on the line.' 'Eqi flag long does not agree,' said Bo lin. I said, 'Then do not flag, do not greed.' Bo lin went on to say, 'Last year we tried to give the autonomous counties. The condition is not a problem. The demand of the masses is the main, the masses have this demand. Why don't you give autonomy?' And preached it: 'We actively ask, can we do it, the proportion of population, geography, and transportation conditions are enough, economic conditions, this zone is not yet supplied by the state. You can also study and research, or actively ask for good.' \\n3, 5.1 Festival, I went to Bo lin House when I went to a teacher's surname and what was not clear. Bo lin briefly introduced, this person is a revolving soldier. Bolin also advocated autonomy and said: 'The establishment of an autonomous county in the suburbs is good, and the conditions are enough than other small counties. The main thing is the demand of the masses, and often nagging each other this issue.' I said to the person at that time, 'Let's exchange more views and actively ask for it.' Bo lin also came to two parties and said: 'We are very enthusiastic about the nation, we are very interested in these issues.' And turned my face and said to me: '× teacher, also very concerned about ethnic issues, we often nagged, exchange is good, opinions can be consistent.' Bo lin and this person may come and go frequently. \\n4, May 4 night, take the opportunity of a symposium, Bo lin to the Longsha Hotel, advocating the township cadre Duo Ruibao, Wo Youhai, and one unknown, saying: 'You go back to the community cadres to study and research well, and then consult with the basic people, this district is good, or autonomous county, the masses really want to Ask for it, we ask the provincial leadership. Last year, if we make a little bit of energy, then the county will give.' Bo lin went on to say, 'You go back and get a good idea and explain these things to the masses. Tractor is national unity, and Qi city has nothing to do.' \\n5. On the evening of May 4, at the Muslim Hotel (hosted by the Municipal Committee), Bulin and Wu Weirong, Trat (Da Language Committee), of us several of us, another Vo Shiyang in secret, said, 'At the June meeting, Daqu representatives went to a lot. We arrived at that time, Heilongjiang province representatives and Nemenmo, Buu, Sea city, Tongliao, Hushi, Wu city to the representatives, fun it's a night, open a Gala party, drink it a bit, play it, know each other, exchange thoughts, exchange autonomy issues. It's easy to get together, should be lively and lively. You say okay?' Attendees agreed, Bo lin went on to say: 'Last December meeting, also held a gala party, but there was no time to squeeze out.' Bo lin's conspiracy intends to take the opportunity of the June meeting delegates to organize a gala form in an attempt to brew and advocate autonomy from it. \\n6, late April 1957, at his house, Bo lin told me: 'Mo Qi is going to visit our suburbs in the summer, and our suburbs are also ready to welcome them to visit. I discussed with Governor Wu (Wu Weirong). Preparing for the meeting with Moqi in Nadamu, strengthen solidarity and ties, and do not breathe well. Through the Nadamudah conference, the three and two people talk to each other, exchange exchanges, and then pull back autonomy and unify their ideology unanimously. Nadamu is ready to be in Naimen Qintun south of the steppe river, very good place, or Haratun River, the place is quite large. In both places here, that is OK, the assembly horse racing archery, the place is enough.' When I proposed, held well in Taiwan, the place is large, there are river grasslands, and sand dunes like green mountains, the scenery is good, the traffic is convenient, there are cars, from Furarki also close, guests are easy to buy things to eat. Bo lin said close to the street is not good. I said, 'Close to the street.' He said: 'Some disturbance near the street is inconvenient, spending more money, there will be waste.' When I said again, 'Close to good,' he said, 'Consider again at that time, and see, if all Taiwan is good, all Taiwan will also be OK.' I suggested that, at the beginning of the conference, in addition to autonomy, speaking text, he said: 'The text does not need to be spoken, nor speak in vain. The masses know what, scientific problems are also solved by scientific research.' He plotters, I would definitely plan with the Mo Qi, Dar-language work committee leading the research plan, or Dörgell planned at the Spring Festival when he arrived at his home? In short, he must have studied and planned by Mo Qi. This plotter is also aimed at gathering the masses from which to carry out three or two ways of communicating with people, brewing and advocating the masses for autonomy. \\n7, May before the provincial text colloquium, Bo lin also talked about this matter with him, saying, 'Moqi Dregher has come to me, let me persuade Manha, agree to the Moqi Autonomous Prefecture plan, let Mangha best express its attitude and support the requirements of the autonomous prefecture. Can I persuade him, nor can he listen to me.' \\nIt can be seen that the issue of the autonomous prefectures, Bo lin has long planned the Inner Munda cadres in Moqi, Buqi, Tongliao and other places. \\n8, May (early May, shortly before and after the municipal text colloquium), Bo lin asked for a national symposium of Daran cadres and nationalities during the text conference at his house, with me. He said: 'I heard that the United Front Front Department of the Central Committee is going to hold a United Front War conference and a national symposium this summer, and to make arrangements for the reunification of ethnic issues, and will be arranged in the first year of the second five-year plan. In our plan for the second five years, we will not be able to arrange for the ethnic autonomy issue. Later, we will not be able to solve it well, and the request is not easy to give autonomy again. Now we do not actively ask, we may not be able to arrange it. It would be difficult, bad to ask. At that time, all over the ethnic group gathered together, we held a national symposium to pull the issue of the autonomous prefectures, unify our thoughts and demand unanimously. If possible, it is best to ask the Central Committee Minister of United War, Chairman Ulaanf and Heilongjiang United Front Minister to participate in joint consultations. Heilongjiang Province very much agrees, I have told Minister Zhang that I wanted to assign the autonomous prefecture to the leadership of Heilongjiang Province. Minister Zhang said that was too good, not only did he solve the Dalu problem, but the Orenchun problem could also be solved. (Editor's note: pure fabrication, Minister Zhang has never expressed such an opinion.), Heihe region and Orenchun are not good to solve, the place is too big. If the state is going to Heilongjiang Province, the Elunchun autonomous flag will be solved. I think, 'Let's go to the June meeting, we also pass through Beijing, and we stay in Beijing for one more day. We Wu Weirong, you, Dragher, Zhuo people and other people go to the Central United Front War Department and the Civil Commission, first ask for a national Daran symposium, and ask the Central Committee, President Ulaanf and the United Front Department of Heilongjiang to also participate in a joint consultation. Amount. Can you see?' I said: OK. By the end of the June session, I mentioned that I would do so if I agreed. \\n9, May provincial text symposium, Bo linzer took the opportunity to hold three meetings:\\nFor the first time, on the evening of reporting on May 13, Bo lin and Wu Wensheng presided over a meeting in the south to door room on the 4th floor of the Heilongjiang Hotel, summoned rich ministers, Nenjiang representative Baingtobu, Suburban Sele, Agu, He Yu, E Zhonghua, and others. The purpose of this meeting is two: ① is to unify and focus opinions on national autonomy, to ask the provincial united front ministry to raise the question of autonomy for the holding of a national symposium and ask for a clear answer. At the meeting, Bo lin first urged everyone to raise the issue of autonomy and asked for a symposium. And encouraged me to propose a national symposium at the meeting, 'Waixian County has also come, so few opportunities are coming together. It is not easy to get together. We take this opportunity to ask for a national symposium and raise the issue of autonomy. Are you asking for a seminar first?' Wu Wensheng said, 'The first is the issue of autonomy, the second is the cadre issue, and the third is the question of words, but the question of words is secondary...' let everyone focus on these questions. ② is to discuss with Ouyang Secretary, Chairman Yu Tianfang, and ask them to attend the meeting to give a clear answer. Bo lin wanted Lin Qing and Duo Junchen to go to Ouyang with me to discuss the autonomous county issue with the chairman. \\nThe second time, before the afternoon of May 16, the provincial united front ministry responded to a symposium (requested by Bo lin), opened a lesson, which raised the content of the same few questions. (At the meeting, it was suggested that, in the words of the prime minister, the Han ethnic group now repaid its debts to the ethnic minority. He Yu said, 'Now the masses say that the roots of Manha are thick, they cannot be removed.' Color heat also openly stated: 'Now the masses reflect, this said outside the district is hanging buns, which sell porridge.' Wu Wenshengtti said: he asked to transfer Comrade Lin Qing to the district committee secretary, and when paying mayor, it would be enough to be mayor. Bo linzer tried to start this meeting, but he did not speak at the meeting, and he pretended to be a good man. \\nThe third time, May 16 at 3:00pm to bell, Bulin rectified Lin Qing, Duo Junchen two people opened a secret meeting, when I catch up, Blins took a white paper with a pencil and duo Junchen two reference drawn map: 'Suburban, affluent zone 3, 4, 7 part of the railway west.' And to Lin Qing and I explain to me, 'how to draw the autonomous county division and so on.' Duo Jun Chen participated in the comments said: 'County site located in Ningnian station suitable.' Lin Qing explained that economic laws and administrative divisions were not linked. 'The autonomous prefecture will be located in the center of Nehe station in the future, the transportation is also convenient.' At the end, I suggested: 'To mention the formal plan for the conference.' Lin Qing finally made an opinion, saying: 'Lao Bu, you go back and study in the district, and put forward a formal plan, and inform me when the zoning, I also went to participate.' The purpose of the meeting, Bo lin said at the time, 'to study the division, how is it appropriate.' And want to come back to let the instructor draw the scheme. Now I recall that the purpose of the meeting was not only to mention the question of formal programmes, but also to prepare for the autonomy programme he described at the next provincial ethnic colloquium. Therefore, he and the wealthy much Junson studied so as to unify the views of the affluent division. \\n10, May 15 after lunch, when I returned to the back floor corridor with Duo Chun Sen, after Bo lin catches up: 'The next time the province is going to open a national seminar, the suburbs are ready to participate in three delegates, I, Wu Weirong, and also want to mention your list. You see if you can take the time off to participate?' After returning to the city, after the meeting was held in the district, he said: 'Governor Wu, you both are party members. If you mentioned, your superiors can believe, I will not believe it myself.' \\n11, in late May, when the district symposium returned to the car, Bo lin asked me: 'Can we take the time of prayer, we can ride to Jiangbei Hara, Jarse, and see how the masses ask for autonomy.' He was so active in Tunzi to gather the opinions of the masses, and I only thought at that time to encourage autonomy. Now recall that he also prepared materials for participation in the provincial national symposium. \\n12, late May, after the provincial text symposium came back, Bulin and Wu Wensheng, color heat, E Zhonghua four people ran to Hamberdae, Red Huotun, Quanhe Taiwan and other Tunzi, by collecting text opinions in the name of inciting autonomy. Back in Taiwan and held two meetings in the district, using the name of the inspection work of the Civil Commission and in his capacity as the commissioner of the Civil Commission. At this meeting, Bo lin advocated the people and cadres who participated in the meeting, saying: 'What is mentioned, everything is done, autonomy requirements, opinions on national work, or district leaders, the work of the civic committee can all be mentioned.' And said to the masses: 'We all discuss, whether the district is good or the autonomous county is good?' At the same time, strongly advocated: 'Mo Qi and Nemenda are all actively asking for autonomy! The plan has already been sent to the central mail, and we are also actively asking for autonomy. Mo Qi and Buqi recently made a written statement at the Inner Mongolia propaganda ministerial meeting, and requested the autonomous prefecture. We also want to express our opinions, and we will see it in the Heilongjiang newspaper soon.' \\nDuring the seminar on Taiwan Taiwan, the director's house of Shan Baha said 'Gang Atun Han people bullying the Red Fire Tunda people', then gave a big introduction to the fish Liangju, and said: 'This matter is done to the court.' And put poison said: 'Red Fire Tun a fellow cows sold (refers to the souvenir company to kill), the child did not eat milk to starve to death.' In April and May 1957, it was also said, 'Zalete flag has several Da ethnic groups in the community, all asked to come to the suburbs. They are not allowed to move in the flag, send people from the Public Security Bureau to scare not allowed to move, and the Da people are very dissatisfied.' \\n13, Bo lin and I said, 'Soviet experts are Slavic, of course, to say Slavic good.' 'Toda Yeva is the Mongolian who spoke much to Mongolia.' \\nBo lin and Meng Hoe said, 'Well, just use that,' 'Text is the symbol problem, whatever text, it is an internal problem. When the self-government institutions are available, how to solve it will be OK. Now it is mainly the issue of autonomy, and focus on resolving autonomy.' This is the fact that Bo lin has used a two-sided approach and anti-party rhetoric in terms of writing. (20 September 1957)\\nColor heat exposes Bo lin's anti-party words and deeds\\n1. When Bo lin visited the Autonomous Region last year, he mobilized Daru teachers to the middle school teacher and said that he said that his aim at that time was to establish personal prestige among the Dalu teachers, and simply denied that it was the Party's care and training for ethnic minorities. \\n2, Bo lin had a meeting in the city, deliberately and I said: 'The success of autonomy still had four or five years.' His purpose was to prompt me to actively call for autonomy, thereby becoming his strong assistant and backbone. \\n3. Bo lin said, 'We can transfer cadres from Inner Mongolia in the future,' and said that 'the Inner Monda cadres have all walks of life, especially many senior leaders.' The aim is to ask me to believe his autonomy proposition, so that I can actively do it. \\n4, when Minister Bo lin when Zhang came, Daqu representatives agreed to establish Dahur ethnic region, told me: 'We can temporarily agree to the establishment of Dahur ethnic region, can be used as the basis for the establishment of autonomous counties and autonomous prefectures.' \\n5. Last year, Bo lin advocated the organization of a team of representatives to play in Mo Qi, the purpose: to take this opportunity to discuss the issue of autonomy with them, so there are ostensibly a few actors in the composition, actually sending some people who actively advocate autonomy to go. \\n6, Bo lin advocated calling me to do cultural work, and raised several times to my superiors, the aim is two: one is to leave the cause of education, to propagate his ideas everywhere; the other also wants me to become the backbone of the opposition party offensive against the people in cultural aspects of the party. \\n7, Blinn understood the problem of words to Hambedrod see Mo Yin after, told 'you can go to school, I said it.' (In fact, Motim has dropped out of ethnic secondary school.), This builds personal prestige. \\n8, Blinn said publicly at the meeting held in the Red Huotun: 'If you are difficult for students, you can contract with our school, wait for the autumn to give money.' Use this means to gain popular support. \\n9. Bo lin did not meet intentionally to complete Taiwan, and he agreed to hold a meeting with the Arab Russia and the Gard. So that night, he met at the single village head's family. Dregher in Inner Mongolia came back from the central government. He also brought their speech materials, DeYuhai's autonomy plan. At the meeting, he asked us to see Zhuoren's joint statement. Call us to see the autonomy plan of De Yuhai, a part of De Yuhai's plan is exclusive The mayor of the Maang district did not occupy the people's aspects when changing the Dalu region, and sought"},

After reading the materials, led by Bo lin and Dragher, studied the sketch of the autonomous region, with the aim: to align Moqi with the Dayan program in the city. Both of them advocated the establishment of a unified autonomous prefecture with Orenchun; however, others did not agree to the establishment of an autonomous prefecture. Bo lin and Dregher agreed to establish joint autonomy with Orenchun in order to produce more, and the government can take special care of Orenchun. \\n10. When Burin met for the second time in Taiwan, Russia and Gal attended the meeting (Gal worked at the Hulunbuir Union Cultural Bureau). In the course of the meeting, Russia and Russia also inspired everyone to talk more about the question of words, and should also mention the issue of autonomy. Gardi finally spoke, he said first: Mangha went to Inner Mongolia as a guest, and was opposed by everyone. On the issue of autonomy, he said: I have stayed for a long time to Moqi, and they ask for autonomy higher than you, so they also hope that the Qi-Da ethnic group should actively demand autonomy. \\n11. After coming to the Central Committee and Hohhot, Burin said, 'There is little autonomy issue, the central government and the province have no opinion. That is, the leaders of the Qi city and district disagree and suppress the Da ethnic group's request for autonomy.' \\n12. When Mayor Liu went to the reclining cattle to a meeting, he introduced to several of us who came in the city at the evening, and said, 'The Civil Affairs Bureau agrees that we are autonomous, others do not agree, you can make your opinion, and our school teachers have all proposed an autonomy plan.' Objective: To incite us to incite the masses in the Assembly, so long as the municipal leaders can agree with us, the issue of autonomy can succeed. \\n13, Blinn in the reclining cattle spit meeting, not only called us to go to activities, but also personally to the masses. For example, when I entered the District Committee West House, he told more than 20 people about the autonomy plan (drawing out his own sketch of the plan), . \\n14, Bo lin asked me to leave the suburbs of Qi city, told me to go to the Central Institute for Nationalities, and said: 'You have little progress here, so that the Han people can come back after overcoming the Dahan idea.' \\n15, Bo lin also told me: 'consider personal status, do not oppose the leadership and the Han nationalists, or you will also do leadership work' purpose: to provoke me more contradictions with the Han people, so that I can climb to the status from the Daqu autonomy after. \\n16, Bo lin's countryside to understand the problem of text is not willing to walk, said several times, 'I should take a car to the country.' Objective: To manifest yourself marvellously and be able to qualify for a car too. \\n17, Bo lin told me: 'After autonomy, there can also be an army.' This is the basis for our opposition group to build the army. \\n18, Bo lin and I said 'when the Dahur ethnic district was established, the list of promoted leaders and I checked'. Ru Bo lin told me: 'In the future, Wu Weirong will be the director of the Darling Committee.' \\nWu Weirong Unveiled Bo lin (1957.10.01)\\n1, he was extremely dissatisfied with the land reform, when he was studying in Inner Mongolia Army University, he said to me that 'people from Zalantun to Inner Mongolia Army University were almost all fought, these people were unjustifiably fought.' He is one of them. In particular, he hated Comrade Hukji, the school brigade captain at the time, saying, 'He did these battles. In particular, some people were beaten to death to live, and now there are scars. This has caused me a stain in history, and I have been censorship every time, and only because of this, my participation has been delayed.' \\n2, after the end of the work of the change autonomous region last year, in the city's September text meeting, he individually spread to me and color heat and others: 'Last May Inner Mongolia text meeting, we encouraged me to propose on behalf of all Daqu, and called for the establishment of the Daxu Autonomous Prefecture in Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang Province.' Returning may be subject to some criticism, he was dissatisfied with spreading and saying: 'This is definitely a vast report.' He said that he 'pretends good people everywhere'; and said, 'OK! Encourage to encourage, this is also a cause for the Dalan people.' \\n3, back from Inner Mongolia in January this year, he said: 'Many of the same people in Inner Mongolia are professors, principals, experts, etc., with salaries of more than 100 yuan.' 'I want to go to Inner Mongolia to be a university professor at least.' Conversely, 'Our place pays poor attention to minority education, teachers and staff are also low, and the treatment is not good.' In addition, he also said, 'This region is not convinced enough of old intellectuals. It is good to hold the hat of narrow nationalism. I really think of Inner Mongolia to work, and I can't mention it in this place.' \\n4, once he also said, 'This time we have the text, we will have our own publishing business in the future. Newspapers need too many people, and these should be well planned and prepared early.' He also said: 'I want to send Booker (accounting of all Taiwan Production House), to the Text Committee or to let drill fine art in the future, so I can do some cartoons and headers in the state newspaper.' \\n5. He also told me: 'The allocation and use of national cadres in our city are inappropriate. Many cadres of ethnic nationalities are placed in places that have little relationship with the nation, and we should bring back some Daqu cadres in foreign counties.' In particular, he mentioned, 'Bo ling Guo Changhai of the Municipal Sports Committee to the National Committee, and Hu Ding Haitiao to the National High School.' etc. \\n6, he had a meeting of national cadres in the suburbs, 'to set up another Dahur high school with Mongolian school.' When I spoke to me individually, he said, 'To set up up, the teachers and cadres of the party corps in various classes are not a problem. Mongolia needs to choke enough. Our people are better than him, better than them.' He also said that 'the establishment of the provincial machinery factory should be transferred back to be a language teacher, and Du Changlock and a teacher would also be returned'. Therefore, he said that the personnel arrangements after the campus were already very well. \\n7. He also told me, 'When Fengmingga was the principal of the school, not only did he have great Mongolian ethnicity in the distribution of Dalu students, he transferred good students to Waiqi County (Mongolian local). At the same time, he was still old bureaucratic. Last year, he assessed teacher salaries as low as possible. Everyone has opinions, some want not to do it from the ethnic group Learning to transfer, etc., this is all he did.' (October 1, 1957)\\nColor Heat Revealed Wu Weirong (1957.10.04)\\n1, Wu Weirong often criticized me for 'having no strategy on the national issue, good to provoke things.' The aim is to make me become a strategic anti-party backbone. \\n2, Wu Weirong said: 'Mang district governor does not work with me, and Han district governor a piece of office.' thereby provoking intra-nation and inter-ethnic relations. \\n3, also said 'Mangha is not willing to go to school'. Meaning that Manha is afraid that someone else will be the governor after he left. \\n4, he also told me: 'I am in the Autonomous Region (Note: refers to the former Wangniu Tuda Autonomous Region), can not be the district governor, that is because he does not meet with the vast ha, so I was called to go!' The aim was to show that he had long been concerned about the nation, even if he would rather mischief in order to take care of the nation, but not the Dalan people. \\n5, Wu Weirong said: 'Mangha only looks good for itself, not to look at others, there is a question mark in the minds of national cadres. For example, Wo Zhenya cannot join the party is a proof.' etc. \\n6, Wu Weirong said to me: 'You did not join the party, did not promote, but also are all in the vast ha, Gaowa, if I promote you as a cultural webmaster or teaching director early.' \\n7. Wu Weirong told me: 'Old students have gone to college, some have become professors, I am not better as a professor!' \\n8. Wu Weirong is ready to write 'a little talk about the national issue', its content opposes the Han nationalism. He also wanted to write 'Nen River Basin' magazine, mainly wanted to describe the life of the ethnic group on both sides of the Nen River, thus proving that the Nen River Basin area belongs to the Dahur ethnic group. \\n9. Wu Weirong looked down on President Li of the suburb court. When President Li made a counterproductive report, he said: 'President Li said bad, so I rereported once, and everyone was satisfied.' So elevate yourself and illustrate yourself amazing. \\n10, Wu Weirong said, 'The district committee does not believe me, said I am a narrow nationalist, only believe in mangha, because he listens to the Chinese people.' Objective: To show that you are concerned about ethnic issues. \\n11, he also said: 'to go to the province before the text meeting called Han Jiang secretary to participate in the text symposium is my strategy, so they will not find problems.' That called me to learn strategy. \\n12. When Mo Qi wants to set up an autonomous flag, Wu Weirong also advocated engaging in literary and artistic teams to Moqi to incite me to carry out 'autonomous prefecture' activities. (October 4, 1957)\\nRussian Reveals Wu Weirong (1957.09.26)\\n1. According to April 1957, according to Bolin said, 'Mo Qi came to visit the suburbs of the Daqu to engage in a Nadamudah congress to incite the demand for autonomy in the masses, unity of thought, and unanimously demanded' the matter, Wu Weirong and Blinn have studied the secret. And to determine the location of the Naimen Qinnan Prairie riverside meeting, according to Bulin said, so doing this is 'far away from the street, lest it be suspected, by the superiors and the government.' And in three or two ways of brewing and encouraging autonomy. \\n2. In May 1957, Wu Weirong's plan for autonomous prefecture has a copy of Wu Weirong. At a secret symposium held by Wu Weirong in May 1957, Wu Weirong read out to everyone through a consensual agreement and use a small meeting to conduct brewing autonomy among the masses, and later put forward a formal plan. Through the Han comrades of the district committee to participate in support, he said let Han District Committee participate in the meeting, this is our 'strategy'. \\n3, in May 1957, Wu Weirong had let Wo Zhenya, Vo Shiyang two people to single chapter Baojia and single study of secret merchants autonomous prefecture, county division problems. This was Wu Weirong's stadium in the district secretly told me that I was also going to participate in the study. (I went to the single chapter treasure home at 3 pm, Wo Zhenya both have returned to the area at 12 o'clock.), \\n4, at the end of April 1957, in the district his office with my secret business autonomy, he said: 'Old, you come to our district public security bureau as a head of a unit, I give you a nomination list.' (26 September 1957)\\nColor Heat Revealed Wu Wensheng (1957.10.04)\\n1, Wu Wensheng understood the text everywhere to promote 'Bo lin is a member of the provincial and municipal CPPCC, provincial and municipal committee members, director of the municipal committee, director of the National Talent Committee, national high school to pay principals'. 'Bo lin is not a democratic man, because he was only student origin in the era of pseudo-full, so his prestige was built under the leadership of the party since liberation.' He also said: 'Bo lin is fast entering the party, according to reason he should join the party, only because Bo lin's concern about ethnic issues was hit by the municipal leadership, and the school also suppressed him from joining the party.' \\n2. Wu Wensheng also told me: 'The change of the autonomous region cadres in our region has long been inconsistent with internal opinions. Everyone asked the autonomous county, as well as Han secretary Yang Yongchun (former secretary of the Wangniu Tuda Autonomous Region Committee), also agreed to the establishment of the Dazhou Autonomous County, only Mangha and the two men who spoke disagreed to autonomy.' \\nAfter he came back from Inner Mongolia, he said to me, 'You know? Why did Minister Zhang (refer to Minister Zhang of the Provincial Committee of the United Front Department), when he called me to go to Inner Mongolia, because I actively advocated autonomy in the district, so I was asked to go.' \\nLast year he also actively supported the organization of a literary and artistic team to carry out self-government propaganda in Inner Mongolia, and prepared funds with the Civil Commission. At the same time, they also showed that they said, 'Otherwise, the superiors do not agree!' \\n3, Wu Wensheng told me to write text materials, and suggested that Bo lin call me to attend the Inner Mongolia text conference. And said, 'If you don't have your list, you will go for me.' \\n4. Wu Wensheng said, 'The mayor of Mangha is not willing to go to school, afraid that someone else will become district governor after going to school \\n5. After Wu Wensheng came to the Civil Commission, he often said, 'We have several secretaries of the Civil Commission, all secretaries can't say who is the director?' He also said, 'The United Front War Department does not believe me. Now what is being done is the responsibility of old Kim, perhaps he is the director!' And he said, I do not want to live in the city, I think of coming in the district. The purpose of this statement is to go to the suburbs that he can be chief of section. (October 4, 1957)\\nColor Heat Revealed Russian (1957.10.04)\\n1, Ao said, 'Mangge spit was confused in the city, repair a embankment will not be autonomous.' His aim was to ask me to spit the mangs to incite the masses to demand autonomy. \\n'We should mobilize Qiqihatun village cadres, because they are near the city unwilling to demand autonomy, and should mobilize them.' He also said: 'I promise to mobilize all the Delta people for autonomy, and I go back to mobilize them every New Year's holidays or on holidays.' \\n2. When Zhang, Minister of the United Front Department of the Provincial Committee, came to a meeting to resolve changes to the autonomous region last year, Russia and Russia refused to participate in the symposium, and took the opportunity to convene a small group that would incite the masses not to listen to Minister Zhang's opinion. \\n3, said: 'Ulaanf does not agree with our Da ethnic autonomy, he is afraid that we set up an autonomous prefecture into Heilongjiang Province, is a serious unitivism.' Also said: 'Inner Mongolia Party Committee hard asked us to pass the Slavic plan, so that after the establishment of the Dalan Autonomous Prefecture was also led by Inner Mongolia, because the same text, they would emphasize this point.' \\n4, when the party put forward the policy of 'flowers in one hundred people,' the Russian and Russian said to me: 'I want to put Morgen (note: I have engaged in reactionary nationalist activities in the autonomous republic), Walwende (is reactionary landlords, struggles), what kind of people is? Is it backward, reactionary as Mangha said.' He also said to me: 'You should not fight Manha. We use him first because our superior trust him, and after the success of self-government, we will not choose him.' (October 4, 1957)\\nRussian Reveals Color Heat (1957.10.12)\\nChromotherm is one of the backbone of the active activity of the Bo lin's opposition group, so Bo lin once boasted: 'Color fever is the most active in the demand for autonomy.' In 1956 after the reclining cattle spit seminar representative Huitun said: 'Color heat, Agu autonomy demand is really positive, and Bolin they drew the county plan. Color heat also criticized the Mayor of Liu for having Han nationalism, cursing Mangha as a faithful dog of Dahanism. Color heat and I also said: 'Mangha is actually a dog, does not care about the national demands. In order to maintain its status, we do not mention the request for autonomy, go to the superiors to report in chaos, saying that Burin instigated, and also said that a few intellectuals were instigated.' And in 1957 the Spring Festival (early ten or so), color heat raised the opinion 'to fight within the nation, and the merciless' opinion in the Bo linghouse. He also said, 'I will not vote for his vote when the autonomous prefecture is established.' \\nDuring the provincial text symposium, color heat, Wu Wensheng and other vigorously encouraged autonomy, and used 'Old, you mention, all on you.' We have two times, dare to give advice, the old Adang County Public Security Bureau is fully qualified' and so on. 'Teacher Bu, the autonomous prefecture was set up and I chose you to be governor.' At the same time, he himself wanted to be an expert, saying, 'I learned to go, and after I came out of the National College, I had to give an expert,' and publicized that the establishment of cadres in the autonomous prefecture would not be a problem. He would like to have a governor at all levels. \\nAt a meeting convened by Wu Weirong in May this year to gather anti-party material to Bo lin, Soleil made a claim: 'Now propose a formal plan (autonomy plan), to set up a preparatory body and start preparing for autonomy.' And advocated 'more open symposia, large open, unified understanding'. He also said, 'Strongly disagree to allow Han people to attend the meeting. I firmly oppose the participation of Han cadres. If they are allowed to participate, I will quit not to attend. I hate Han people the most.' \\nWu Wensheng advised me, 'Do not rush, there will be a clue on the issue of autonomy in the future. Let's slowly rectify, why are you so excited.' Wu Wensheng, in his capacity as secretary of the Civic Committee, advocated holding a symposium on 'Unity Ideas'.

When Bo lin unveiled the fallacy of anti-party, anti-socialism and separatist national unity at the third session of the provincial CPPCC session, he sent this letter on June 18, 1957 to support and encourage Bo lin's reactionary words and deeds. They flaunt 'sincerity to go socialism', but ask the reader to see, they have a certain job in their name. What are they actually busy day and night? This letter was handed over by Bo lin personally, and we can only see from the relevant parts of it the vicious means and conspiracy of this small group of right-wing groups to achieve their political ambitions.] \\nComrade Bo lin:\\nThe day before yesterday, read your statement before the Black Provincial Committee of the Political Consultative Conference. I very much agree with and support your ideas and views on the issue of ethnic autonomy. What you mentioned is what we all should insist on. Comrade Bo lin! Your bold and consistent attitude is that we should learn, because this is right, but we are not isolated. There is widespread support for the majority of the ethnic groups behind. As far as I understand, the Nemenda cadres have generally expressed their support and support for your statement. We have been eager to want this issue for several years But I want to work harder to achieve the final victory, and I personally estimate that we're going to form a state is possible. Yes, I see now that the obstacle is mainly as you pointed out the problem of two provinces. \\nWith regard to the ideological mobilization of Nemenmo, Abu and other flags to the Black Province, the work that led to the agreement of the Inner Munda cadres has now been basically completed (I don't let other comrades know). For this matter, I have individually mobilized some of their cadres after last year to Mozambique, but I did not have the advantage, actually passed 'Do not talk about belonging to them' 'Leadership relations only talk about autonomous prefectures', given to Chairman Mao and relevant central departments, this Among the adoption of the plan, except that some cadres of Mo Banner did not agree to be included in the Black Province mainly blocked Comrade Wu Juer, the drafter of the program, Comrade Wu Jul, who very disagreed to talk about the issue of leadership relations, because his drafter and had some prestige to the cadre of Mo Qi, so he continued according to his assertion. But my claims at the time also played a certain degree of influence among the cadres. On this basis, in January of this year, I drafted a plan with the main principles and interests of placing Mo, Buu and Aqi into the Black Province under the pretext of national interests. The program was handed over to Comrade Sedabu, a reporter of the Hulun Daily (resident in Moqi), and gradually mobilized Mo through him Flag cadres, will turn the program into their, by Comrade Sedbou, actively worked hard to finally complete the victory in April Having mobilized the work, and successfully adopted a new plan for inclusion in the Black Province, Mo Qi cadres have chewed up by negative and now, all believe that there is hope. In my work like Moqi, I started with Black Province, but I didn't go through you. I knew very well that the situation of Zidar cadres had not yet been left out of the Han and bureaucratic chains, so I started reliably and from another base corner. In addition to you last year, I exchanged views with many responsible comrades such as Eyingshou, Single-Chapter Bao and many other responsible comrades. When I went to Inner Mongolia Zhongqi in February this year, Comrade Singbao discussed this issue once again, how to mobilize, how to mobilize. After returning to Hailar Food Company, I also studied each other with Comrade Sedebou Next, and send the Mo Qi plan to deter the relevant comrades, to you. \\nComrade Singzhang Bao of Qi District played a great role. After receiving the Mo Qi plan, he first held a seminar in the North Office of the Furarji Road, attended by Comrades Wo Zhenya, Vossiyang, Exinghai, Guo Yongqing and other comrades, Wu Weirong, Jin Baocheng and other comrades sent a letter to the association to express their full agreement. They also held a number of meetings in various places, and went to the countryside and publicized them with the masses. My intention at the time was that the subjectists would be repulsed from the bottom up, otherwise a few of us shouting only on the top, and instead made the subjectists think that they were not the opinion of the basic people of the Dalan people, and it was now generally moved, and the local subjectists began to shake. According to your recent knowledge there, although still persuading the party members to make it negative, I think this is in vain, as according to On one side of the understanding that Comrades Ee Yingshou and Wu Weirong said that they began to show no attitude again. However, we also need to be wary of the poison of subjectivity and Han nationalism, because we are experienced comrades do sometimes unconsciously come up with the ghosts. \\nHowever, I hope that you will be careful about your remarks, especially those of Dalu cadres or masses. Although we sincerely are sincerely in order to move towards socialism and want to get into the socialist road faster, and to properly solve the Dalan issue, it is inevitable that someone often misunderstands, so in order to make the revolution The smooth development of the industry, it is necessary to be cautious, Comrade Qi District single chapter Bao is very concerned about the nation He, and has a fairly level of understanding, the analysis and handling of the problem is often more appropriate, and disregarding the individual, he has always been bold to propose the cause of the people. Therefore, I hope that if possible, he would be better to attend many meetings of the Daqu, especially to Beijing or the city to discuss autonomy or language Words and other problems. \\nCurrently, most of the Inner Mongolia is not a problem. Mo Qi is also the same as the Qi District. The spirit of the program has been implemented to the general masses, and I have worked in accordance with your spirit in Hai City and related comrades. \\nLet's talk about it later, words are a lot. \\nsalute\\nWe wish you continue to win\\nVery Busy Grass\\nMozhgen, evening of June 18 [Compilation of Materials from Anti-Bolin Right Group (Second Series), Qiqihar, Heilongjiang Province Ethnic Affairs Committee, January 1958]\\nPAGE 15"}

He participated in the 'Baihua Academy Society', and he did not say anything, but was classified as 'extreme right'. First, he stayed in school to check the punishment, and was re-education through labour for two years in the Cultural Revolution. He was the youngest of us, and probably the smallest of all the right, was born on November 12, 1939. He was under 18 years of age when he was classified as the right, not yet an adult. Here is his readme for being the right.--Wang Shu-Yao\\nBrother Shu Yao：\\nMail received, you proposed 'topics', I never dare to think, research 'people' are not as simple as natural science, think about yourself feel confused, family, school, friends, many strange things, of course, also read books... all have an impact on their own, what is wrong Complicated, trying to get out of a mind, it seems not an easy task. \\nI am a Mongolian, the descendants of Genghis Khan, and my ancestors came to Beijing with full clearance. In the Qing Dynasty as an official, after the Xinhai Revolution, I was born in such a family of 'the old and missing' of the former Qing Dynasty. Listen to the old man, my grandfather was a good official, a Qing official, and a righteous official in the Qing Dynasty. In the late Qing Dynasty, in the late Qing Dynasty era, the Qing government supported the Boxer in the early days of the Qing Dynasty, and later the Qing government failed, and then made an unequal treaty with the Chinese people. My grandfather was in the mountain. Xidatong House is a premier house, just because he resisted the court, did not capture the 'Boxer' and was dismissed as the people. Returned to Beijing to buy a small house and stayed down (later also blessed by woe, did not suffer any impact in the 'Xinhai Revolution'). My two uncle fathers did not go to a new school. The Republic of China did not do any work, eat old books. It was an authentic 'old and little old in the former Qing'. One of my aunt workers poems and happy country paintings were little fame at that time. My father, the youngest, went to a new school in the Republic of Korea, and then enrolled in the Department of Literature at Peking University. He was wanted by the government for participating in the '5.4' school campaign. I was helpless and several classmates exiled in Japan for many years, and served as a visiting professor at Tokyo (Imperial), University in Japan during the war of resistance. \\nI was born in Beijing and divorced from my parents when I was 3 years old, and I was sent to Tokyo, Japan. Kindergartens and lower grades are in Tokyo Chinese school in Japan. (When people are in full swing, I see the good moral style of the Japanese people, the kindness of Japanese women, the anti-war parade of Japanese college students on the streets, Tokyo and Japan that were blown into pieces of scorched earth by American planes. The suffering of our people. Later I understood that hate should not be a country or a people, it should be war itself and those who advocate and wage war.), I didn't return to Beijing until 1947 after World War II, and my father was a teacher. After returning home to study at Yuying Primary School; this is a church school, belonging to the Christian Congregation, I am a 'resident student', and the teachers who manage our lives are nuns, their kindness and tenderness image, so far It's a lingering memory, we often go to the Congregational Church after school. I have two uncles and sisters nearly 30 years older than me, they are both doctors of Concord Hospital, Congregation Hospital also belong to the Congregation, every Christmas and other important church activities, they all dressed me pretty to take part, the event will meet a lot of the same beautiful little classmates dressed at that time. Light... (It's also an episode that I and Jesus taught a bit of origin.), \\nJunior high school is also in Yuying middle school (later changed to Beijing 25); although it has been 'liberated', the red education depth in all aspects, but 'Yuying' church schools, nobility schools, the legacy of 'Yuying' church schools, nobility at a moment is not clear, free ideas are active, extracurricular words are colorful; foot, basketball team, Yuying), Bei (full), choir, Yubei Repertory Theatre... are among the top in the school system of. Flight model, ship model activities and Beijing 13 (former Fu Ren attached high school), mutual fight. (Later, it was learned that the majority of right-ranking teachers in the school against the right, especially the history and language teaching department, were basically wiped out of the entire army, with a 'right rate' of over 90%. Some say that this also created a 'country's most', and my junior high school alumni 'right' ratio was also much higher than usual, if you say (Yuying' is the cradle of the right.), \\nHe was read in Beijing. This school, formerly known as Beijing Normal University Hall, is one of the longest schools in Beijing school, 'before liberation' and Hebei Beijing middle school, students in northern provinces, children of landowners and old-fashioned families, school style and Yuying secondary school are very different. The idea of feudal antiquity in the 'post-liberation' old Beijing is easily replaced by 'communism' preaching. I have felt the spirit depressed when my classmates were also immersed in the joy of being liberated, and were still fighting for the 'tame tool'. I did not 'fight' into the 'regiment' and 'party'. In fact, I didn't think too much at that time, but I was reluctant to find more 'restraint' for myself. \\nIn 1956, he was admitted to the Department of Physics, Declared as the right on 16 September 1957. Actually, I didn't say anything at all, just because I was at the level of my time; a science nerd did not make any remarks, just because I participated in the 'Baihua Society', it was classified as 'right,' and 'extreme right'. \\nThe above is my resume before the right, and I write some fragmented thoughts about your questions. \\n1. childhood I was an authentic 'naughty bag', the formation of ideas is always lagging much more than physiological age. As a child of intellectuals of family origin, in preschoolers always have to recite many poems and things like that. This may not have much to do with the starting point of memory and fear of the formation of ideas, because reciting some poems can only be sold and manipulated in front of people, elders laughing and laughing at themselves. Maybe you can get a little reward, actually don't understand anything. For example, 'Poetry. Guan Dou', where small years will know what is called a lady, what is good, let alone understand the beauty of 'bell drum music'. If people to adulthood will always understand what love men and women, at the age will understand 'Guanduo', then a person does not go through many sorrow clutches, is to see 'bed bright moonlight', will not think of 'bow thinking hometown'. In fact, some popular poems are not so well understood. \\n2. the influence of the family on me may be greater, parents are children's first teacher table, whether it is to me, or their own words, their history, what they do, stealthily form their own norms of being human. Many of the ideas and behaviors that are not very adapted to today's society, most are still formed in my more special family; for example; ① the idea of strengthening the weak and strong. ② I only have rational respect, I don't know to worship somebody something. ③ To speak of integrity, to be handout of the mind... and so on. \\n3. I have talked about my contact with Jesus, and I do not believe in God because I do not know worship. But Jesus taught fraternity and equality still permeated into the mind, and with 'fraternity and equality' naturally spawned 'democracy and freedom.' And then it became a lifetime of seeking. (Some people say that Jesus is a great enemy of the Communist Party, perhaps for some reason). \\n4. I am a Mongolian, a 'minority', remember when I was a child accidentally turned the 'Lu Fangweng Poems', and the last one was his 'Shile Poem':\\nDeath is known to be empty, but sadness is missing Kyushu. Wang Shibei Ding Zhongyuan Day, the family sacrifice is not forgotten. \\nBeside the original poem does not know who and took one:\\nGod Takeo Tuwanko empty, car book is the same as Kyushu. Heaven south under the day, I do not know how to sue this weng. \\nAfter looking at this, I've been excited about it! In elementary school, Yuefei's 'angry crown...' was particularly disobedient: drinking human blood, eating human flesh, and laughing while chatting, this is a horrible picture, are they people? For Mao Zedong, he also looked at the 'poem' of 'only bend bow and shoot great carvings' before they began to think that he was a historical madman. Later, more historical knowledge was learned, and there was a little experience of living in Japan at a young age. Before and after thought, it became clear: all 'nationalist' prejudices were wrong. Originally there was no separation between ethnic groups, contradictions were provoked by the rulers, and those who benefited from contradictions will always be the ruler, the bloodshed、It is always the common people who suffer. All those who provoke contradictions to wage war are all sinners of history. \\n5. although I lived in Beijing as a child, winter and summer holidays can often go to rural family and friends living some days, some strange things can be seen many, support, nooker, Northeast jumping God, the five gates, but not talk about fasting, is the real thing I see, some have real evidence, so that people can not Do not believe. But this contradicts the teachings of the school, later in cognitive matters; ① things that science can not explain now can not deny its existence. ② Any 'say' should be examined before believing. (It's called suspicion of everything). \\n6. about reading (extracurricular books), I would be ordinary; preschool is some 'painting book' or 'reading picture literacy' such as reading; elementary school knows the word, just look at some fairy tales, as if 'Journey to the West' is also finished in primary school; junior high school is basically watching Chinese novels (except 'Red House Dream'); The basic reading is the so-called 'world famous book'. Read a lot of natural science books, widely and not deep. The social sciences can only be said to be unheard. Like poetry (not only Tang poetry and song words also include Heineh, Byron, Shelley, Shakespeare...), can be called 'Sinology'; from the Three Words to the First Qin Zhuzi, Five Books, Turtle Wenlo, Five Gossip... (except in textbooks), I know little. \\n7. My favorite book is John Christopher, and only this 'novel' seems to resonate with his soul; that was when the second grade, borrowed the book from the library believers, turned a few pages 'like treasure', watched it all day and night; Once again, the day the book was returned, on the way home from school and bought a set at the bookstore. My bookshelf is the only set of 'novels'. It seems that it was not long before the society started a wave of criticism of the book, saying that he was promoting heroism, saying that he poisoned teenagers, and so on, of course, I never put my heart on the 'criticism' of these. As for how much a book can affect a person, I don't think that the book resonates with me because I have a 'gene' that resonates with this book, which is made from home, school, relatives and friends, and hundreds of books I've read, just don't look at it. The book, this 'gene' has long existed, of course, there are also effects, just like giving flowers some fertilizer, The role of fueling. \\nCome here first, for reference only, I look at all the clutter enough, what questions, please ask you specific points, so as to facilitate the answer. \\nAfter the right, my treatment is 'three categories of students', 'stay in school to check, continue learning'. Later I saw that all students who graduated in the 'right hat' were sent to the Great Northwest to work, and I managed to move back to my account and escape from school. Even into another book, the day home is not too good, enduring swallow, a little casual mixed mouth to eat. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, I was beaten to death by the Red Guard, and then copied my home 'sweeping out' and swept to the labor reform team (two years). My elderly people have also died in the Cultural Revolution, and I have lost my family since then. After two years of re-education at Chadian farm, I had been homeless after dissolution. I had to stay in the labor reform team 'employment' (employment is life imprisonment). In October 1969, I transferred to the Shanxi Wangzhuang coal mine. Due to the constant failure to 'confess guilt', the 'right hat' was worn until 1979 'implementation policy'. \\nPAGE 4"}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached 1]Shirakaba: '80 Years of Dream' (Lecture at City University of Hong Kong on 24 October 2011)\\nI am an ordinary Chinese cultural person, like all Chinese cultural people, with innate flaws from tradition. There is a very simple proposition, and so far there is no clear answer to himself in terms of concept and practice, that is patriotism and loyalty. \\nWhat is Patriotic? Patriotic is the heart of gratitude and attachment to the mother. What is Loyal? As a rule, loyalty is humble, blind subjugation and worship, shameful help to abuse. Many elites in the history of our great nation are confused to death in a rope screwed by these two opposing concepts. The love that Qu Yuan loves unsustainable life is the country of Chu under King Chu, but also his own parents. In the history book, the vast majority of the faithful will be loyal to death. Yue Fei's 'strong huai' is for the people, but also for 'Jing Kang shame, not snow', 'stay from scratch, clean up the old mountain river', and finally to 'Qianque'. \\nIn 1982, I wrote a drama to the Beijing People's Art Theatre, 'Huaihua Qu'. Assuming that before the death of the Fengbo Pavilion, Yue Fei recalled the journey of 'thirty fame and dust, eight thousand miles road clouds and moon', so as to have some alternative thinking about the value of his life. Obviously, I tried to unravel this 'Three Thousand Years Rope' through this drama. Thanks to the Beijing People's Art Theatre for accepting the work and rehearsal. Unfortunately, on the day of the rehearsal, I was alone in the big audience. The curtain never rises after it landed. \\nIn the late 1970s, in a movie script, I just asked a naive question: 'Do you love this country, does it love you?' Actually, this is an old question. In the early 1980s, some thought that the problem was deafening, and others thought it was an inverse. How can I get out of this ancient confusion? \\nIn fact, 100 years ago, the answer was already in place, and it has been put into practice-that is to move towards republican. \\nHowever, as a great nation as a whole, the ability to distinguish in practice is rather low. The values of the traditional culture of our nation, as the history of the long period of imperial dictatorship repetitions, 'imperial supremacy' has deepened the hearts of the people. Thanks to feudal literature, the emperor and their system of rule have always been linked to the desire of millions of people. The subjects have long lived without minimum dignity and self-defeating days, but the many calamities imposed upon them by the emperor were treated as gifts. To be executed late, thank the Lord Long. It will even mourn and regret for the imperial emperor who died because of the impoverishment and luxury. Is the emperor really a day!? Is it really a natural British Lord? \\nOur historians rarely tell the people of the Hereafter the truth about the emperors of history. In fact, apart from a few founding emperors, most of them are incompetent or malformed children, and the emperor's so-called upbringing comes from-and only from old monsters, physically and mentally handicapped concubines, palace daughters, and castrates. Many historians are painted once, either because of self-protection, or because of the confinement, or because of the disguise of the dictator. In particular, some people who do historical fiction, film, television, Lin's total 'Dynasty' series and 'The Great' series. There are people who are speaking, as are the actors, and most are rendering the idea of 'imperial heaven'. In every emperor, too much wisdom, kindness, excellence, god, fortitude. \\nIn fact, the most selfish people in the world are a handful of dictators whose full purpose is to keep their throne. Their trick is to make the people willing to accept repression, killing and enslavement, under the super-powerful force of repression and threat, and long live. \\nFor example, in the Qing Dynasty, Yongzheng and Qianlong Dynasty, which some cultural people greatly appreciate, the emperor denounced 'bark' to 'bark' and cut his throat with a knife. So our history can only be a history in which most people are constantly praying for gifts, with the birth of the TD monarchy. China's wisdom, intentionally or unintentionally, is giving advice to the emperor, and even seldom considers what it expects of itself, and even forgets cleanliness of its own existence. In the minds of many Chinese people, it is indeed a 'one day must not be unchecked', just like the loss of heavy dung baskets on the back of the donkey, at all times must not be calm. \\nAfter the Xinhai Revolution, the Revolutionary Party people gave power to Yuan Shikai. Yuan Shikai is still not enough, after three years of planning, actually became emperor in 1916 New Year's Day in 1916 in the fifth year after the 1916 New Year's Day. Although soon suffered fierce opposition of the Republicans and deceived. However, the throne of Kowloon in the hearts of many Chinese people has not collapsed since then. Yuan Shikai was approved after his death before his birth and finished skin, odor. Just one year, Zhang Xun was reinstated. Zhang Xun's braid army is only 5,000 people in the district. He lifted up an abandoned 'small emperor', and he actually favored and flourished. Even the Huanglongqi store, which had closed for more than five years in Beijing, returned to the old industry, and supply was in short supply. Some people had to use paper paste a dragon flag to support the facade. Many people gathered in front of the palace waiting for the hearing of the 'emperor'; people who did not rush to the old clothes shop to buy the uniform, no 'pig tail' people went to the costume store custom made with ponytail wig braids, they wear robes, shaking real and false big braids shake the city. Knowledgeable Kang's work seems to have long been foreseeable, and in advance, and on the day of Zhang Xun's restoration, he said, 'I expected that there will be today too!' Wang Gong nobility, old and old age is to recover lost heaven, what is the civilian people for? Of course, the 'sacred imperial power' in the mind is making a blame. \\nWhen I was young, whenever I saw the history of Yuan Shikai and Zhang Xun's restoration, I always felt that it was funny and ridiculous. But after figuring out the KMT slogans of 'one leader, one political party, one doctrine', I can't laugh when I figured out that they used 'national conditions' as an excuse to carry out 'military politics-training and government' for an indefinite period, and 'one-party dictatorship, to govern the country by the party'. The secret that they maintain one-party dictatorship is still dependent on the police, the constitution and the agents. The Kuomintang received a rich political legacy from the Xinhai Revolution and Mr. Sun Yat-sen under the name 'Republic of China'. In addition to the braids that cut the back of the national head, the most striking change is that the walls of the tea house have many 'not to talk about state' slogans. Everyone knows that it is not a government announcement, but a warning by nationals to themselves, indicating that some nationals have begun to understand that this is the imperial system that does not play the dragon flag. \\nFrom time to time, the Government kills a group of dissidents, sometimes in public execution, sometimes secretly. Nationals are, logically, subjects. The Kuomintang has always trained 'training and government' to Taiwan. Fortunately, Chiang Kai-shek moved to his son Jiang Jingguo, and Chiang Jing-guo did not continue to 'train' and spread his place, only suddenly stopped. \\nNot sure if lucky or unlucky, I was born in 1930. \\nAt the age of 8, I saw the fish caught swimming as a slaughter farm by Japanese troops, and the rose-red river flowing through my feet. \\nAt the age of 10, the Japanese gendarmerie snatched my father from me, and all my life I had a chagrin too little power. The father was detained, tortured and buried alive. \\n11 years old, I walked away, half-work and half-work. I firmly believe it is accumulating strength for vengeance. \\nI am a student movement at the age of 16, and I firmly believe that I am shouting for the country's independence and prosperity. \\nI am part of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), at the age of 17, and I firmly believe that I am fighting for a democratic and free new China. \\nAt the age of 18, I broke my right hand in the trench covered by heavy snow and artillery fire in the Huaihai battlefield, and wrote my application for joining the party. I firmly believe that I am making a solemn declaration for the most sacred cause in the world. \\n19 years old, on October 1, 1949, I embarked on the village of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and shouted loudly: Mr. Sun! The revolution has succeeded! I firmly believe that the Chinese revolution is truly a complete success! \\nAt 21 years old, I entered the literature, and I firmly believe that my work is a new, revolutionary literature. \\n25 years old, just because he gave Hu Feng a marble inkerstand, was quarantined, criticized and reviewed for eight months, I firmly believe I made a serious mistake, because Hu Feng was counter-revolutionary (although I always treated him as 'Goethe', he was also indeed 'Goethe'). \\nAt the age of 27, it simply said that 'To allow cultural people to have their personality and their own cultural hobbies, associations of cultural people should not be Yamen', and were beaten as anti-socialist right-wing elements with no right to publish works for more than 20 years. I firmly believe that there are no mistakes in the Party and Mao Zedong. The mistake lies in myself. \\n36 years old, with all my works as evidence of guilt, was quarantined for 7 years. I firmly believe that even Guo Moruo is self-defeating, and the spell swears to confess himself, what do I count. Until 10 years of havoc, it shocked: many famous scholars who had been forced to commit suicide had only two contents in the book. The first is to shout for wrongs, confess their boldness and loyalty, and then, 'Long live long live'! Isn't this the 'Wangque Shane' after the death of the ancient emperor? I can't believe it when the words of 'Life Without Frontiers' appear in the newspapers every day. Isn't this the only sound that can make the dying Western wife laugh after the end of the Qing Dynasty? \\nIn the summer of 1967, in quarantine, I stumbled on a rebellion tabloid that landed on the ground and looked at a 'newspaper,' which reads: 'Great news: Red guards copied their homes in an ancient house and copied ten yellow dragon flags! They then climbed the city walls and waved the Yellow Dragon flag towards Beijing, sworn to Chairman Mao, the reddest red sun and express their infinite loyalty.' My confusion disappeared! A sense of shame that converts to pain hit the heart. \\nAt that time, 56 years have been since the Xinhai Revolution; today, 44 years have passed, adding up to a hundred years. \\nLate in the Cultural Revolution, I began to reflect on my life alone. I just started to have doubts! Looking back on history, those generations who have been ridiculed by us, including those who have come out of the world, Nederson, they have devised many tragedies and farce in order to adhering to the imperial power, so flattering, to meet the power! Knowing that they are ridiculous and pathetic. I woke up at this point: Aren't I going through it? But even this awakening was absolutely impermissible, which is why I was crussed by the national media in the spring of 1981. \\nWhen the first critical text appeared on the press and on TV screens, the telegrams and letters of solidarity with me flew like snowflakes. So, I firmly believe: the Chinese began pulling their numb legs and feet in the mud, although they were very hard! (Lecture at City University of Hong Kong on 24 October 2011)\\n"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached 2]Birch: My Midsummer Night Dream (2012.7.20)\\nBefore 1949, 12 Xidan She Rice Temple was an old-fashioned Beijing hotel-Garden Hotel. He then became the offices and dormitories of the 'CFA Film Script Creation Institute' and 'Film Arts Council'. In the summer of 1953, as an amateur film script author, I stayed in this 'hotel' with a preliminary draft of my own film script. At that time, the State paid no more attention to the creation of film screenplays. Really lucky, in this hotel in the past, a careless and a movie master will pass through, such as Cai Chu Sheng, Shi Dongshan, Zhang Min, Sito Huimin... and so on. At that time Chen Boer just passed away, there was no reason to see. Of course, I have had the most contact with full-time screenwriters, some of them were film artists in Shanghai, and some had participated in the war of resistance and went to Yan'an. Most are literary soldiers who were active in various battlefields in the war years, and all came to the end of the year. I was a literally late life among them. Like a year of water, youth is not stationed, today I have reached the year, the old Beijing 'hotel', which has long ceased to exist, will often appear in my dream, with my predecessors, especially those who should not leave, but leave us prematurely, trance is still in the 'hotel' Inside walking around. \\nYi\\nFirst is the director Wang Zhenzhi, Wang Zhenzhi, I was 14 years old, height of 1.8 meters or more, and was proud of his personality. He was a man born in Hunan, the earliest revolution and drama activities are in the north, so he can't see a Chu person. He has participated in the 12.9 student movement. During the Yan'an period, he also served as a drama teacher of Lu Yi, wrote a lot of live drama and drama in the war years, and held many leadership positions in the art group of the Eighth Route Army. He first summoned me in his shabby office. I thought he was going to introduce me to the rules of the creation institute, or to talk about my first draft of the script and how to modify it. Very excited before listening to the teachings of the old revolution. But he made a surprise to me, and his first sentence was: Have you read old Tolstoy's Anna Karenina? Of course! I admit, read. And then he talked about Anna Karenina, and he was surprised by the memory of several episodes in the book. He also talked about the situation of 'Anna Karenina' in Yan'an, a dilapidated version of 'Anna Kalenina', which can only barely read the Chinese version of 'Ana Karenina' uninterrupted reservation delivery. One girl with white was sewn into a long dress, standing in a trance by the Yanhe, saying it was experiencing Anna Kalenina's sadness. He says:\\n'A novel that looks irrelevant to the revolution, will have such a great charm?! I heard that Lenin had read the book repeatedly, and the last cover was broken. For a moment of silence, he continued, 'Well written, really good, very good. Many important questions were raised. Skill, unparalleled. Anna suddenly thought of the man who was crushed to death by the train when she and Warrensky met for the first time, and the reproduction of the scene seemed to remind her... how good a pen!' \\nThen he recite the sentence in the book:\\n''The candlestick she used to read the book of anxiety, fraud, sorrow and sin, shines an unprecedented brilliance, shines everything that was shrouded in the darkness, followed by a slight beep of candlelight, dim, and finally extinguished forever... 'The avatar is at the same time with Anna to see that forever extinguished...' A chill. After a moment of silence, I still moved his topic very skilfully and slowly to the film side. I said:\\n'I only recently saw Garbo played Anna Karenina.' \\n'Ah?!' He was surprised: 'Where did you see it?' \\n'We have a small library of films at the General Administration Film Office, and I've seen the movies you wrote there.' I am referring to the triumph of the people of Inner Mongolia. He was busy swinging hands:\\n'Promotional film! Propaganda!' \\nI want to correct him:\\n'Feature film!' \\n'No! Propaganda! That's what a story.' This controversy, he followed me away from Anna Karenina. As a director, he said very sincerely to me that he was 'not confident, very upset.' Always want to jump out to engage in his own creation, he said:\\n'Make your own creation, success and loss, all belong to yourself, perhaps happen to write a real feature film. As director, too much pressure, the film was particularly valued, and even Lenin talked about the importance of film to the party's propaganda work. Once a particular topic has been identified as a focus by the leader, the script has to be changed endlessly, with comments coming from the top. For example, we created the 'Huai Shang People' script, which is the top priority. Famous writers Kong Jue and Yuan Jing serve as screenwriters. Chairman Mao personally wrote eight words for managing the Huaihe River-'Be sure to heal the Huaihe River. ' I believe that the Huaihe River may be cured, but I wrote the project to govern the Huaihe River into a good movie. I, the director of the film script creation director, said it would not be good. I see the art is 'intentionally planted flowers without hair, heartless willow shade. ' Many of the works of art are heartless willow!' \\nThese words make me sound cool. He is a particularly approachable and very humble person. Often put the phrase 'I am a layman so far' on his mouth. He always gave the opportunity to give guidance to his superior leaders, such as Wang Lan Xi or Chen Huangmei at meetings discussing or reviewing the script. At that time, the final passage of a film script was in the hands of Zhou Yang. What makes me even more strange is that this old revolution in Yan'an, who participated in the whole wind, has no city. One day walked into my room and said to me:\\n'Don't look at so many screenwriters, all day in their room, progress is slow, some people have no outline for more than a year, others have an outline, but never form a script. Writing is a personal affair, and can't be like a war, you have both been a soldier, and have written literary works. You should know that writing is not a shouting, you can take the 'bunker' down.' \\nSoon, as he wished, he was transferred back to the Northeast Film Studio as a professional screenwriter, and I never saw him again, nor did he write the real feature film he wanted to write. Until the summer of 1957, at the climax of the 'anti-right' movement, the news of Wang Zhenzhi's suicide was suddenly coming from Changchun. The film industry was shocked. In a very small range of burglary discussions, people are confused and complained that he shouldn't be! How can I think of lying track? A big old man! I immediately thought of some of the words he talked to me, which must be like me, 'Words must be lost.' Could he think of Anna Karenina's last glimpse in despair? Thinking of that 'candle,' that Anna Karenina 'used to read the book of anxiety, fraud, sorrow and sin, shines an unprecedented brilliance, shines everything that was originally shrouded in darkness, followed by a slight beep sound of candlelight, dim. And finally extinguished forever...' I thought, once a person felt he had good reason and courage to die, as for the death. Method, that's just trivial details. \\nèr\\nMy best friend at Shesanji 12 should be Heimer. We met before I went into the film screenplay house. In early May 1953, I and he participated in a mission organized by the General Political Department of the PLA and the China Writers Association to visit the 26th Northeast Army Hospital and to visit volunteer prisoners of war repatriated by the United Nations. The delegation was all old writers, such as Hu Feng and Luo Feng. Compared to them, I look small. Heimer's age is closest to me, older I was seven years old. This Shangdong Peking, who was a member of the revolution as a teenager, graduated from the North China General Assembly, worked as an actor at the Jizhong Military Region FireWire Theatre Company, wrote some drama and Yang opera. As soon as we see it, we can say that he is the only friend of mine. Every time he sees me, he always gives me some cold water, from looks to work. From time to time, he suddenly ridiculates me in person:\\n'What do you think your novels and poems have value, the ink is forgotten without drying. Now all around you are middle school students, they are blind. You think you're fast? We have a lot faster here, I'm fast hand, think, a battle just started, a live drama written. Quickly, can you decide whether your work is art?' \\nSometimes he will suddenly staring at my face and rightly derogate me:\\n'Do you think you're a beautiful man? Not! Small eyes, swollen eyes, body is neither high enough, nor upright. Forget it, you!' \\nI learned to introspection under his 'ruthless blow.' Again such as:\\n'You're really thin enough, see what books you buy, are some newly published translations, and it's a 'one-side-down' Soviet novel. You notice that the books I buy are not, all old books, broken books, and magazines, these old books, broken books, and magazines are more precious than those new books and are more useful for creating.' I noticed that he was one of the largest collections of books. The widest walls were all bookshelves, filled with a variety of old books, and the earth was filled with publications and pictorial papers issued during the Republic. He pulled out a very old film pictorial to me, pointing to a female star's stills and said to me:\\n'You see, there is only one night path left by God to the camellia, but when the revolution has replaced God, it should be left aside!' \\n'Who is she?' \\n'Blue Apple!' \\n'Who is Blue Apple?' \\n'Young ignorance, who Blue Apple is you don't know! Also want to be a writer, come over.' That's what he says in my ear who the Blue Apple is. 'This year you've come by accident, she may not be in the country, or you'll be able to meet her in this yard. She is one of the deputy directors of the Film Arts Council and occasionally come to meet.' Haimer in the middle of a good friend, is famous for the mouth without interruption. To me, he added only one sentence: 'Little fart child, know less things, or well.' \\nHeimer often travels, in order to write the script 'experience life', went to the Korean battlefield, and listened to Panmunjom negotiations. One time he went to Shanghai to collect the story of the underground struggle and came back to me:\\n'I visited Yu Ling in Shanghai, they are real underground party members, and once they talk to them, I can't write, the understanding of the underground struggle is too poor!' \\nThat day I suddenly asked him a question:\\n'The screenwriters are all old comrades from all battlefields, their experience is very rich and wonderful, why run to experience the life of workers and farmers?' Heimer sighed and said: 'The question you mentioned is really worth touching, indicating that my brother started moving his brain! But you should know something from the critique movie 'Between Us and Couple'. Intellectuals on the screen? Overhang!' And then he thought, 'Actually, you and I can't count as intellectuals. When participating in the revolution, they were secondary school students. What are the intellectuals?! This is really unclear.' \\nI did not even know why that day, I told him a very abrupt word. I said:\\n'Heimer! You always do not have a home, be careful sister-in-law ran!' \\nI really didn't want to 'revenge' him, but he looked at me barely and didn't answer me. I can see that he cares about his sister-in-law and loves her. Heimer's wife is a young cadre from the Old District Women's Salvation Society. People are beautiful and generous, and are the kind of country girls who can quickly adapt to urban life. Organizationally very trained, sent to the People's University to take a job and study, just gave birth to a daughter, named Silent, and the child laughed. I did not expect, and then sister-in-law really broke up with Heimer. Late autumn, I returned to Yunnan as soon as my script passed. After that, we never met again, but intermittently heard rumors about their fate. In the early 1960s, one of the most famous events, was the criticism of the movie 'The Hole Blown'. He simply wrote in the script the bureaucracy of grass-roots cadres and the appeals of the masses, and was severely criticized. Even if Marshal Chen Yi appeared publicly to justify him at a meeting, he was quickly rejected as a right-leaning view. And then, it's about the death of Heimer. On June 14, 1968, that was a day of the most horrific period of the Cultural Revolution, because Himer had too much disrespect for Jiang Qing in his speech. At that time, Jiang Qing was so prominent, how hot it was, Haimer was beaten to death. The man who saw the remnant of Heimer said only eight words: unbearable and unseen. Ten years later, although the case of Heimer received a 'crackdown', the task of identifying the real murderers was very difficult, and could not find the mob who first waved the stick to Heimer, nor the murderer who finally made Haimer a lethal stick. That alone is enough for us to reflect deeply over a lifetime! Half a century later, a very chance, I met silence. Seeing her, I felt deeply ruthless, from a young baby dancing hands to a woman full of wind cream, only experienced a nightmare night. For her, what I told him was probably a father who made her feel very strange. \\nSan\\nIn the main building where the writers lived, every weekend, almost all the people of the building visited relatives and friends. After dinner was very quiet, at 6 o'clock, there will always be a woman's cry in the corridor: called a person's name, the name is well rock shield. Her voice was loud, sharp, and somewhat doubtful. Every time I had to call more than a dozen voices before disappearing, after that, I started writing. At the beginning of summer, Heimer came back from Panjom, North Korea, and the first question I asked him was the source of that female voice every weekend. As soon as he listened, he immediately answered:\\n'That must be Guan Lu. Do you know Shanlu?' \\nOf course, I know Guan Lu. During the Japanese occupation, I saw her picture in the 1943 Japanese Illustrated Paper, which was taken when she attended Japan's Great East Asian Literary Conference, which made her a traitor known to women and children, and was constantly scolded by the people of the country. It was only after 1949 that her true identity was a clandestine clandestine of the CCP, a red spy who was ordered to penetrate into the Tiger's Cave But for this, her youth, love and reputation have been completely shredded and stained. But what makes me difficult to understand is why not quickly publicize her deeds and let this heroine on the hidden front recover his reputation on a wider scale? Why have she been scolded so far? \\nToday, this mysterious character is actually my neighbor. I asked Heimer:\\n'Can I talk to her?' \\nHeimer replied:\\n'No better! On this upstairs, a lot of people hiding her, and once on the weekend she called well rock shield's name because she was too lonely and nobody told. \\n'Well Rock Shield is her lover!' \\n'No! Well Rock Shield is also a writer who studied in Yanan Lu Yi, one of our screenwriters. He's only 30 years old, a teenager than Guan Lu! May well rock shield talk to her, or only he is embarrassed to refuse to turn off.' \\nA few days later, in a dusk, I passed through the aisle and off, and she inserted the key into the keyhole, did not immediately open the door, and stood in front of the door and looked at me. I also did not push my door, a few seconds of view, the light was weak, I could not see her face. She called me first:\\n'Little birch!' At that time, literary people did call that, because there were two older 'birches' in the literary world. \\nI walked past. She pointed to me and said:\\n'I know you, from Yunnan frontier, Heimer told me. You are really young!' \\n'No! I am 23 years old!' \\nShe laughed bitterly, sighed and exaggerated repeated my words:\\n'Already 23 years old!' I guess she must have thought of her 23 years old. \\n'Would you like to come in and sit? Do not delay your writing?' \\n'For a while, can? Don't whip you? Comrade Guan Lu.' \\n'Very welcome! Please.' I walked in, she put me in a chair, and she sat on her bed, and then the intellectuals were simple. I thought she had forgotten, or deliberately erased the 'camouflage' of the past. Naturally, I started looking for a romantic poet Guanlu on her look, Red Spy Shut, but I all failed. In her 40s, she looked a little older than her peers at the time. She is already an ordinary old man, walking down the street and nobody can think of the talents she used to write many sunny poems. It was never thought that it ever wore the most tangible cheongsam, walking along the Shanghai Xiafei Road, handkuts and earrings sparkle. The heels of her funky shoes are often in and out of the 76 Pole Sphiel Road-one of the most horrible 'wolves'-Wang's agent headquarters. At this point, I can see that she is fully supporting the confidence that conceals her nervousness. At that time, I was very child-friendly and always wanted to explore her most sensitive and mysterious past. \\n'Comrade Guan Lu! It should be said that you are back in the film world.' \\n'No! I haven't made a movie in the past. As soon as I saw me, people remembered the lyrics from Cross Streets, 'Passion in Spring, 'and that was an occasional play ticket. I haven't written a movie script.' \\n'Now you can write, your experience is so rich and magical. You can write a great movie.' \\nThe muscles on her face even swings a few times, like laughing, and crying:\\n'Young comrades! Do you know about party discipline? One of the iron disciplines is secrecy, facing party secrets, I don't have myself, my love, my hate, my youth, what I lost and what I get, my poems, my dreams, including stories I want to tell you and you want to hear, all in a secrecy room with lots of locked drawers, in which there is a drawer lying on a thick archive bag, on the file bag, the top right corner with top secret two words written in the middle With a big name-Guan Lu, I'm in that bag, as to when to open that bag, let me return to my own shell, I can't know...'\\nIt seems impossible to hear from her the mysterious story I'd like to hear most, because she won't tell it, it's party. Did our conversation end here? She doesn't speak anymore, the whole room is silent like death, and the entire floor is silent as dead. \\n'But I can't talk nobody. What can I talk about? My Chai Rice Salt Sauce Vinegar Tea? My home, my children, no, no. But I'm not lonely, I hope someone often tell me something, family life! Social news! Why do people quarrel, why grind, why laugh, why cry?' \\n'... do you have no pain and pleasure?' \\nShe looked at the window in vain:\\n'I didn't say to you, I'm not here, Guan Lu did not come back, no dew here...'\\nI finally understood that her conversation just wanted to listen to others, strictly speaking, what he wanted to hear is someone else's stories and lives. \\n'Ah! That's it, your old friends must be a lot.' \\n'Yes, some...' She whispered four words and she stopped saying anything. \\nAnd again paused for a long time, she begged me with her breath:\\n'Say yourself, how to join the army, how to walk through the fire line. Yes, you are from Yunnan border guards, there are strange and exotic, romantic stories, there are a lot to tell!' \\n'Yes, there are a lot of unfinished topics.' \\nAll she wants is to listen. I struggled to start talking about my experience, and although she and me were very positive, one to one way, I was not used to it. Soon I was caught in a tedious dilemma that was hard to get out of. At this point I fully understand why she calls well rock shield in the walkway every weekend, and why most of the weekend's evenings are not in the room. Sudden power outages gave me a reason to say, but she lit the candle very quickly and told me:\\n'It's not better, not power outages, and I often face candlelight alone.' \\nI had to talk again for more than an hour, and she might have seen my tired:\\n'Well! Thank you! True grievances to you, weekends, young people should be lively with young people.' \\nI stood up so relieved and she shook farewell and said insincerely: 'Very happy! Comrade Guan Lu!' \\nOut of her room, I was implicitly worried, worried that every weekend, she shouted not well rock shield in the corridor, but my name. But what I was worried about did not happen. In order to put my script into production early, I went to Beidaihe summer villa, and I never saw it again. Later, it was horrible to hear about Guanlu: implicated in the Panhan case in 1955, he was imprisoned for two years. In 1967, he was arrested again, another eight years of iron window career. In March 1982, it was heard that the CPC Central Organization Department had announced her a decision to rehabilitate her. I'm really happy for her: this time should be really back. However, before the end of the year, she heard that she swallowed a lot of sleeping pills and died. For this reason, many people are asking: Why? Why after the rehabilitation, in the wash out of filthy, just to shine, and hurried away?! \\nI did not ask... 2012.7.20\\n"},

Published short stories, poems, drama series, many long novels, screenwriters of films are 'mountain bell horses' 'sun and sea' 'peacock princess', 'the last aristocracy', etc. \\nIn general, the right wing of the Beijing army has to allocate the Peking University to reclaim the land, or to repair reservoirs in the mountainous areas But I made people envy the allocation of a military factory on the outskirts of Shanghai as a fitter. This cannot but thank Admiral Xiao Hua for his favor. \\nHis decision, at that time, was really a risky affair. Its evil consequences did not appear until the Cultural Revolution. The shelling of Xiao Hua's big print was filled with the General Political Department building, many of which were to expose the alleged crimes that he had always 'carried out the rebellion' to protect the god of cattle. He considered that my home was in Shanghai and that my wife had cancer. \\nWhy is my home in Shanghai? That has to be said after the anti-Hu wind and anti-anti-movement in 1955. The eight-month isolation review in the Lotus Pond in 1955, felt physically and mentally burnout for the first time in life, especially wanted to have a quiet home room. \\nMarries film actor Wang Bei in winter 1956 to Shanghai. Joch and Sun Jinglu, the two houses in Shaoxing Road that they managed as a friend, loaned me as a new house. At the time of marriage, according to the repeated caution of the PLA General Political Department, the governing body I belonged to at that time, should not be exaggerated. Only one guest was requested at Jinjiang Hotel, mainly the female partner with the dormitory in the film studio before the bride marries. As a result, many friends were slow, and after many years, Zhao Dan also yelled to make up his table for a good wine. \\nLending to live in someone else's house is always untough, and Shanghai's houses have all been nationalized, private leasing and trading activities have just stopped. Many people have been asked for a lot of authorities, and even found Zhang Chunqiao, a prominent figure on the Chinese political scene ten years later, Zhang Chunqiao, a prominent man on the Chinese political scene for a period of time, under the 50s Half-leaf, he is only secretary of the Communist Party Committee of Shanghai Municipal Committee. \\nAfter all efforts were fruitless, in the early spring of 1957, I took the risk of writing a request for assistance to Qi Yanming, then Secretary General of the State Council and Director of the Experts Bureau. Fortunately, he wrote a note to Shanghai at my request. The Shanghai Municipal Housing Administration came to see my house. \\nAt first, they showed me, of course, houses in very poor conditions, and even basements. Once, twice, I was really hard to accept. The third view of the house is located on a secluded road in Xuhui district, where there are no shops, only houses, at the intersection of three roads there is a street garden, the heart garden stands a Russian poet's avatar of Pushkin, Shanghai, on the street stands the avatars of foreign poets. There is no only one. \\nThe designated house I want to see, according to the habit of the Shanghai people, belongs to the Nongtang Garden Bungalow. As soon as I entered, I was strongly attracted by its clean, quiet and vines climbed with the greenery of the walls. There are only 24 conjoined garden bungalows, four in a row. \\nThe two houses assigned to us are downstairs of the last house, the dining room and living room, and a small 80m2 garden outside the floor-to-ceiling window. \\nWhen I put on the right-wing hat, on the train and Ling Zi wind, I felt the heavy hat when he turned his face out of the window. Ling Zi Feng at the Shesan Temple in Beijing, and I was forbidden to get acquainted, but he had to treat me as a 'piwa' ghost. It is with this mood that I returned to Shanghai. And I was greeted by the kids who sang 'Good Socialism' at me outside the fence of my Shanghai residence: '... good socialism, good socialism... reactionaries, to be defeated, the right can't escape!' \\nHere I would like to mention in particular my neighbour, Mr. Road, a witness to my decades-long rise. \\nOn the day I looked at the house, a staff member of the Housing Authority told me, 'Upstairs is the old owner, Mr. Road.' I immediately heard what 'Mr.' meant, but he added four extra words: 'Bourgeois.' \\nI did not see Mr. Lu when looking at the house, saw Mrs. Road in the kitchen, she was cooking, put down the spatula in her hands, very graciously answered my various questions and told us: 'In the future we are neighbours, after you come, the two will share this kitchen, there is an electricity on the wall in the entrance gate Then, you don't install it separately, share the two, save.' \\nAccording to Mrs. Lu, Mr. Lu worked at the factory. On the way out, the staff of the Housing Authority told me that the factory he went to work, which was his own private property before liberation, has now been privately owned by the public and private. He retained in the factory as an engineer. \\nI had a very good overall impression of this, and I couldn't say anything bad about the neighbor of this road surname, and I was afraid that the Housing Authority staff said I was picky. It was decided at that time: OK! Live here! \\nShanghai was very convenient, before moving to the furniture store, immediately came to a mechanic, according to my idea, soon in the original living room and the original dining room made a wall that can be used as a bookcase, the original dining room became our bedroom and study, the original living room became our Living room and dining room. \\nMoving home is already the early spring of 1957. \\nOne night, the rain was heavy, and I went to Lan Xin to see the show back late at night. Shanghai people in and out of the back door, in the door saw a tall middle-aged man, wearing a wet rain poncho from a very dilapidated bicycle. When he took off the poncho in the porch, I noticed: he was wearing a navy canvas overalls and sleeves on his sleeves, each leg tube was sandwiched with a wooden clip for clothes, and several patches were added on the semi-high waist rubber cover shoes. He laughed and whispered to me, 'Sorry, you're comrade?' I said, 'Yes, you...?' 'My last name...' 'Ah! You are Mr. Lu.' 'Yes,'\\nHe knows, of course, that the gentlemen in my mouth are not honorable, but to show their respective positions. He smiled and said, 'Comrade White! We are close neighbors. What does not conform to the principles of the revolution in the future, please be more criticized! More correction!' \\nHis extra and hard words made me embarrassed, how could I bring what 'revolutionary principle' into the neighborhood relationship? But I was the first to rise a strong class barrier between us! \\n'Good night! Comrade White!' He put his bike in the porch, very polite and went upstairs after good night. This is the first time I met Mr. Lu. \\nThe road home has a distant relative of food, is an old woman of a recent flower. It is said that her husband's family had grace in her early years, and the homer will adopt the old woman for life for this purpose. She was housed in the workshop used to park cars, and the family called him 'step-maiden' for three generations. This half-slave 'stepmother' often due to his embarrassed identity shows off or wrath, the mouth always leaves a gossip. Neighbors from these sporadic pieces of information will be able to know many of the past of the Pathways. \\nMr. Lu is not the head of the family. He is Mr. Lu's mother. The old lady of the road is already an old man, still does not like others call her a lady, and is happy to call her a lady. I heard that the old 'lady' rarely went downstairs, much less go out. Very few times go out, is to the 'red house' Western food restaurant for dinner, always call the 'Xiangsheng' car to come to the door, narrow, it is very difficult to get in and out. Every such time, her grandson would say a playful saying: 'Again, Kosky (driver)!' At that time, there was no taboo for Kosky. Because he is the leader of the German Social Democratic Party and Second International, Lenin's 'Marxist traitor.' \\nThe first time I saw 'Miss' was on a spring afternoon, the fragrance of lilac flowers was sent to the room from outside the window and I was reading books. First, I heard a woman's voice shouting in Shanghai on the stairs, 'What about people? Where did people go? What about my afternoon tea?' Then I heard someone knocking the door of my house. \\nI opened the door, is an old lady, face coated with fat powder, holding a small gold teapot, neckline with lace on a white silk shirt, dressed in a dark safflower jacket, solid black trolling long skirt. Immediately reminds me of the dusty beauty of Dickens pen drowning old dreams. She speaks of Mandarin with a Gangnam accent: 'Sorry! Sir! I don't know how the gas is lit, I want your help and give me the gas stove... okay?' 'Of course,' I heard from her words who she is. 'Lady!' 'No, Miss.' She quickly corrected me 'Miss! Come with me.' \\nI took her into the kitchen, I pitched the matches, opened the gas, and lit it. Then zoom in, zoom out, turn it on, turn it on. 'Very simple, husband... Miss!' 'I never dare to move a switch like gas and electrical appliances, and in the past, I didn't need to move. Can you wait for the water to open and leave?' 'Of course.' '... hear you're a writer? Do you understand foreign languages?' 'I don't know... because of participating in war, I have to give up my studies...' 'I can't comment on the gains and losses of this sacrifice... I think it's inconceivable that a writer doesn't understand a foreign language, I can teach you English, do you have time?' 'Thank you, I'm afraid it's hard to take the time because my work unit is in Beijing.' 'It is a pity...'\\nThe water in the pot boils. 'Is this open?' 'Yes.' I helped her make tea, shut off the gas and send her to the stairs. I want to help her. She said, 'Thank you! No, I can jump waltz miles!' She said that she put the train in a semicircle and stepped up the stairs on brisk steps that were not appropriate to her age. \\nOne day, I remember that it was a Sunday morning, and in order to catch the train, I got up at more than four o'clock, afraid to disturb the dream of my neighbor upstairs, and when I went to cook milk, it was very light. Once out of the door I felt that there was a music hidden from the upstairs, although the sound was very weak, I could still hear that was Schumann's 'fantasy'. \\nIn the kitchen, I saw a coffee scent, and there was a stranger in the kitchen, and I could only see his back. He hid a very bright flower hat on his head, and the red pompom was looped on his right ear, wearing a snow-white velvet robe. A pot of coffee is being cooked on the gas stove... I cough gently, he can't help but hit a chill and turned around, and I recognized him as Mr. Lu. \\nI called 'Mr. Lu!' If you do not pay attention, he simply can't see his eyes flickering in a moment of desperate sorrow, and only a moment, he calms. He faced me calmly: 'Comrade White! You got up so early?' \\n'I'm going to travel to the field, catch the train.' \\n'Ah! You are really hard!' \\n'Nothing, you...?' \\n'I haven't slept yet! Use the weekend to make a technological innovation for the factory... you see, I don't look like a circus clown?' \\nHis self-mockery made me surprise, and he continued without waiting for me to answer, 'This was the line when I was an exploitative class. I thought it was a waste, waste is a crime. Are some very sturdy materials, wear this line out during the day, of course, it is difficult for others to understand, thought I was dreaming, dream lost heaven. So I can only wear it at night, diligent and thrift, waste use! And this coffee, which has been stored for years, produced in Brazil, has been a bit musty... All the material wealth for people to enjoy is created by the working people, Brazil is a tropical country, where coffee beans, picking coffee beans are very hard and very hard, some say, a coffee bean is made with a thousand farms You see, I did this, right?' \\nI inadvertently replied, 'Using waste, of course, is right...' 'Thank you Comrade White... 'He nodded and hastily went upstairs with a boiling coffee pot. The already very weak 'fantasy' came to an end. \\nIt was a year when I went back to Shanghai, it was the spring of 1958. During the year, both families under one roof have changed a lot. I moved from a revolutionary soldier to an anti-socialist bourgeois right-wing, devolving a Shanghai military factory as a fitter and receiving supervision and labor. My wife became a right-wing family, and our duo became a reactionary family. \\nThe life of labor transformation in the factory was very boring. At the beginning, it was hard to understand me from the director of the active military factory to the worker, and did not understand that a young officer, a young writer, turned into a bourgeois right. Can you approach and talk to this person? How to treat? The eyes of the workers are strange, novelty and fearful, like treating a poisonous but beautiful flower. \\nSoon, the party secretary and factory director of the factory were criticized for being kind to me, and the workers whom I approached were aimed at being backward. Especially a lady of a deputy director, who devolves labor, and I have the same workshop and a team, she looked for my problems everywhere in order to get into the party. Although the first day I went into the workshop, became a qualified fitter in a week, monthly technological innovations, and if I were not a reformed bourgeois right, I would be rated as a model of labor in the first quarter. \\nCommunist Party will be more, I am a class enemy. In addition to the fighting meeting, I can't attend any meetings, so after work more time, sometimes sit in the barber room, the hairdresser's class view is not very strict, so I am very willing to talk to me. \\nIn early 1959, the hairdresser told me that his native Subei starved many people, and his relatives went to Shanghai to seek help, hoping that he poured the crumbs in the pillow (that is, the shell of rice), out to bring them back to the country for hunger. Many hometown people are sick and puffy and die. Doctors do not dare to diagnose, because those people's disease is starvation. I don't believe what he says is the real thing, it's rumors. \\nIn 1958, the country's great leap forward, reports from the central to the local party newspaper have a history, mu produce thousands of kilograms, tens of thousands of pounds, more than 100,000 pounds... Where did those grain go? \\nLater, a veteran in my dormitory was my fellow, party member. He returned home once in the summer of 1959, and I noticed that he became silent when he returned. His bunk was above my bunk and usually never dare to talk to me. \\nThere was a big night in the dorm only me and him, he lay on the bunk, I lay in the bunk. He slowly began to tell the story of his return to the roof: 'The people in my hometown are almost starving, and I hardly see any loved ones. So many people starve to death, and no one dares to say they are starving to death. I only saw an aunt, she was alive. Even her little son is starving to death, why is she alive? It's incredible, speaking. One day and night, rainstorm, thunderbolt lightning, my aunt heard a livestock hit the door open, she pushed the window and looked, was a hungry crazy pig. She immediately ran out and closed the door, and the pig ran in the yard. My aunt picked up a door bar to meet up and knock the pig down to the ground, and she herself did not know what he took. While her little son did not wake up, she dug the pit and buried the dead pigs in the ground. She dare not to tell her son, nor eat him pork because he is too small to understand and expose the wind. If someone knows, she can swallow her mother and son alive in order to grab pork. She always dig up the mud in the late night and cut a small piece of meat and cooked down. She watched her son wasting, puffy, and died...'\\nI did not make a word, I pretend deaf to dumb Of course he wants me to be deaf. During a period when the people across the country, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, carry three red flags, the punishment for spreading such stories will be the most severe. I understand in my heart that he is the extreme of pain, and no one can tell. To say to any employee, it is possible to be accused of secret. I had to say to a class enemy, the enemy of this class is his hometown. He knows that the enemy of this class will not expose him, nor dare to expose him, even if it is revealed, he can not admit, and at the same time fight a rake, said that it is a framing of the class enemy against party members. \\nNot long ago a very skilled welder in the factory was missing, and I love him because he loves to say playful words. He was later told that he was placed in a labour farm without trial. The crime is reactionary thinking, opening underground factories. What is an underground factory? Someone told me that he just welded several reinforcement bars at home with arc welding at home at night. \\nShanghai has historically been one of the most restrictive cities. Prior to 1949, people were pricey and liberal in terms of how much money they possessed; after 1949, people were determined by the political identity assigned to you by the Government. \\nAfter I came back in 1958 wearing a right-wing hat, I heard that my neighbor, Mr. Lu, stood firm in the anti-right movement, not only did not say a word of anti-party sentiment, and did not even wrinkle in his brows, with the Communist Party, resolutely betrayed my class, rejected and resisted some The bourgeois right (all of his relatives and friends), in tandem with the 'anti-party' Moreover, refusing to sign an opinion letter from someone who 'attacks' the party, diligently and diligently reforming labor, consciously volunteered to offer a reduction in the retention of wages and fixed income. After the anti-right movement began, it actively posted large print, criticizing the anti-party anti-socialist fallacy of the bourgeois right, not only safe, but also received recognition from the factory union. \\nDuring the Spring Festival, the factory union sent the big saffron to his home, making the left and right envy. It is said that the best-performing bourgeois like him is only five out of a thousand in Shanghai. \\nAnother big thing is that Mr. Lu's sister actually came back from overseas, and the lady was dead in this family and never mentioned. When she did not leave, she resented each other because of her pursuit of freedom, autonomy, and her mother. Her daughter went desperately in anger, following an unnamed rotten seafarer to marry the Nanyang. This action humiliates the family, and the mother sends a poison oath: eternal life and the interruption of motherhood forever. \\nI don't want to, the rotten seafarers who are despised by the Yue family exerted strong, miraculously became a billionaire. The resentment of mother and daughter, brother and sister naturally freed, and very kind, a tearful family book flew overseas, although only in the letter can express thoughts, the daughter living abroad can see at a glance: the family living in Shanghai is food scarce and difficult life. \\nAt that time, many so-called 'bourgeois' in Shanghai regretted that they did not fly far before the spring of 1949. If you still have one or half of your relatives staying overseas, you have a so-called 'overseas relationship'. This relationship is beneficial and disadvantages. Originally, 'overseas relations' was a drag, even a scourge, and could conceal as much as possible. With the continent's economic hardship in the late 1950s, 'overseas relations' suddenly became profitable. With 'overseas relations', you can enjoy the treatment of overseas Chinese families. \\nAt that time, for a China that had no economic ties with the Western world and whose ties with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe were almost interrupted due to misdemeanour, limited foreign exchange was too precious! At the time, according to the amount of foreign exchange, you can ration rice, white noodles, cooking oil, pork and shopping cards to enter the overseas Chinese store. \\nOf course, the best of this kind of relationship is not Taiwan, and if anyone has a loved one in Taiwan, he will surely deny it and report: missing. The daughter of 'Miss' is not Xiao happened to reside in Nanyang, so not only can he send money regularly, but also return to Shanghai in 1960 to visit their families. \\nNot as good as a first sight, the life of mainland people is really distressed. Shanghai is a happy paradise in the eyes of the whole nation, and heaven is still so. Vacancies on the shelves of department stores are actually supplemented by queued 'Mao Zedong Collection'. All kinds of rations, including matches, needles... Famous restaurants like Jinjiang and International have implemented a policy of high price sales, their dishes are at least five times higher than the price. \\nThese restaurants have been lined up into long dragons from the day. Most of them are gourmets of the past, old people who take the rest today, they have money and have leisure. Old man tall erected once luxurious coat neckline, old women put thick wool scarves with tears, loudly exchanged their experiences in line of food, they ate almost all franchised restaurants serving high-priced dishes in Shanghai. 'Joe's 'cat ears' is still good!' 'The broth of the royal sand does not reduce the year!' 'Clean and fine actually has authentic return meat! But hurry early.' 'The lion head of the old hotel is full of glutton.' \\nSpeaking of Ruijin Hotel, Donghu Hotel, Shanghai Tower, Xingguo Hotel, Hengshan Hotel these places, a wrath. Because it is well known: those places always serve delicious cuisine, but only senior heads of central, Shanghai, and provinces and cities. \\nAn era has an era of aristocracy, old age aristocracy, money can not work, can only wait in autumn foliage patiently line up to buy high-priced food. \\n'Miss' from the far back daughter looks in the eyes, remember in the heart, really feel that his loved ones are very poor, originally extinguished feelings seem to have resurrected again. \\nWhen she returned to Nanyang and saw any town street street stalls selling food stalls, she couldn't wait to write, she wrote, 'O God! Why do you forget China, which gathers the most children of your children, when you throw your well-being?' \\nAccording to the 'step lady' revealed with the lowest pressure voice, this letter scared Mr. Lu without human color, immediately ignited the letter burned into ashes, and then threw the paper ash into the toilet toilet, and rushed into the sewer. \\nSince then she has been sending money to his family in Shanghai, not only to send money, but also a large bag to send them food and an application, from Thai rice, Canadian fine white noodles, to a wide variety of canned foods, jenin milk powder, Swiss white, Belgian chocolate, Japanese sewing boxes and a variety of spices in Singapore... so our two shared kitchens often drift out of curry after the night. The scent comes. \\nIt is said that the daughter of the unshaw sends parcels every day with the Lus Lloyis sedan as a manifestation of good practice. After a stage, sending the parcel could not meet her wish, and spent a lot of money to emigrate to Hong Kong for her mother, and bought a sea-facing apartment in Hong Kong for her mother. \\nThere are three statements about her motive. One said: This is the revenge of the daughter against her mother's contempt for herself. One said, This is a complaint by Edeh of his daughter. Another saying is: When she returned to Shanghai, she was surprised to find that her mother and brother were 'revolutionized' and that there was no complaint about the status quo. Ok! The more you revolutionize, the more I want you to corrupt. \\nShe certainly did not know that the family who stayed in Shanghai was forced to 'revolution' so 'revolutionize'. Even if they returned from overseas, fear has become the habit of her loved ones. \\nThe message from 'steppers' intentionally and unintentionally: 'Miss' was promptly approved by the authorities to move to Hong Kong, considering the political performance of Lujia and Zhang's family, trust is a form of reward. \\nThe military factory that I accepted to be reformed is far north of Zhabei and is catching up with the big leap forward across the country, coming back only once every two weeks, every time he arrived very late. \\nAt one time Mr. Lu met at the door, he nodded me first, and although the lights in the porch were dark, I saw the change in his eyes. In the first moment, it flashed a trace of sympathy, which quickly went out. \\nI heard him talking to me, but the voice seemed very distant and strange, and he used to humble himself, but now it was quite different. He said to me in a tone similar to the party secretary of our workshop: 'White...' He didn't know what to call me as good. After a little doubt, he called me a 'sir' out of my surprise, although he did not mean to give a tooth for tooth, I was seriously hurt at that time. \\nHe said, 'Mr. Bai! Even to the ground, rich, anti-bad, and right, the party still gives the way!' Although the focus of daylight was not on me when he spoke to me, the blow to me was fatal. He was a bourgeois! What is he qualified to teach me with euphemism? And call me sir! \\nIn the same place, I call him sir, as if it was yesterday, and today he threw the ball back, and I felt that he threw a lot more than the one I threw him. \\nBut now, what do I have to say? He's also a bourgeois, but he is a bourgeois who stands in the same position as the Communist Party and is a target of solidarity; I am an anti-socialist bourgeois right and targeted. \\nI had a hard time in my heart and said a word, even if I said a wrong word, a reactionary word, did it become a bourgeois right? How hard to understand that I have no capital, even with the bourgeois, can deprive me of what? It is, of course, limited personal freedom. Besides, I don't think that I was saying that was a mistake. \\nHow is the character conversion so easy, so absolutely, so fast, the contrast is so big!? \\nMy son was born in the winter of 1959, the first year of hunger following the Great Leap Forward. As soon as his son cut the umbilical cord, his mother had no milk after surgery due to illness. At that time, the milk was already under privileged control and could not be ordered. \\nThe only way is to find a mother, mother is easy to find, around Shanghai is hungry, as long as no rations, meals, pay can not. In order to survive, mother left her child in the countryside and drink wild vegetable soup. In order to preserve the life of adults, I have to endure the pain of leaving their children in the countryside. Can children survive? It's hard to imagine! \\nWe looked for a Yangzhou mother through the residents committee, aged 30 years old and wasted. She dropped her burden and was catching up with lunch, the first meal she was embarrassed, only eaten half full is two big bowls. Immediately after this meal, my wife and I held a secret emergency meeting. \\nSon will not speak yet, there is no way to make a statement. Mother's meal enough to eat us two of us quantitatively, broke our wishful abacus, thought each person eat half a bowl less than enough for her to eat, who knows...? \\nMy food ration is 28 pounds a month, my wife's food ration is 25 pounds a month, a total of 53 pounds. I was a fitter at the factory, and one of my grain was to be brought to the factory, and only 25 pounds of my wife remained at home. From her mother's meal, even if 25 pounds were given to her, she could only eat one meal a day. \\nWhen the mother does not eat, there is no milk, no milk, and the son will grow little. What to do? Even if there is money, no food stamps, even a fritter cannot be bought, food stamps can not be bought for sale, and buying and selling food stamps is an illegal act, and there is no way. That's when I realized the difficulty of having no food at home. \\nEvery meal wife's eyes look at the mother's mouth, that mouth is terrible! \\nIn the beginning, there was some embarrassment for my grandmother. Three days later, she let go of her belly for dinner! Do not take your sad gaze and diminishing face in your eyes at all. \\nBy 1960, the food was even more straightforward, thanks to his colleagues-film actors who were active on the screen, often put together their saved food stamps for their wives. \\nOne day Lujia's 'step-maiden' sent our newly-born son a listen to Knin milk powder, which is tantamount to a drop of manna from the sky during the heavy drought season, pleasing, and to no avail. When his wife thanked the 'step-mao', 'stepmao' scared two hands and whispered in the ear of his wife: 'Don't let the upstairs know! That's what they gave me. They think you don't know if someone from overseas is sending them something... how could you not know? Moving upstairs at night is always going downstairs! At this point, she seemed to be closer to us, because we and she lived downstairs. \\nWhat she says is indeed the truth, that is, 'stepmao' does not tell us, we feel it will also know that, in Shanghai, we and our roadhouse are 'sticking neighbours next door'. What can we hide from 'affixed neighbours next door'? We don't need to spy on intentionally, everything is clear at a glance. It is not the government that they are afraid of, because it is precisely because they attract much foreign exchange and never reveal any grievances. They are afraid of the jealousy of their neighbours and right, if they see someone around them enjoying big fish meat, envy fire is bound to rise, as everyone knows, strong jealousy can drive people to make things unimaginable. \\nThe overall image of the road home is like Mr. Road I first saw, wearing a damp poncho in wind and rain. As for his face, his daylight, his skin, his inner heart, you can't see it all. But as their neighbor next door, you can "},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "imagine that they have the freedom, warmth and happiness in the screw shell-if it could also be called freedom, warmth and happiness...\\nThis fragile stability remained until the beginning of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, when the shell was finally broken down and a serious political crisis emerged. \\nThe things come out of the children. Mr. Lu's eldest son Damin has an all-round friend François, who studied French literature at a famous university in Beijing, so he gave himself a French name. It is said that when he was admitted to college, the political trial was not qualified. Due to the idea of 'scoring handsome' of a deputy principal, he was enrolled in, becoming an extremely bad example and a difficult problem in school enrollment work. \\nIn order to solve this dilemma, a month before graduation, the school removed him on the grounds of 'reactionary thinking'. The idle Francois and Dahua's origins are similar: Francois lost not only the factory that his father left behind, but also his face. His file followed him back to Shanghai, which characterized him as 'reactionary' and handed over to the mother-in-law of the Lilong Committee to supervise labor. \\nCriticism is his new homework. Those mother-in-law moms know the language of the newspaper, the donkey lip is not on the horse's mouth, spitting the stars on the face, increasingly causing his dissatisfaction. And his grievances-and even hatred-were hanging on his skinny face at a glance. \\nHe and Damien were a little firecrackers on the tail of the dog from an early age, flipped the wall to catch cricket companion, a beat. In the porch of the back door every night, the two people talk about the news of Voice of America and Taiwan Radio broadcasts, saying the bad words of the leadership of the Committee, causing villains, complaining about the resentment of being discriminated...\\nI don't know which little chilot was heard, and when he went to the street to the villains where he reported, on the same day, François was dictated to politics, a fight, beat him swelling, less than half an hour 'bamboo tube poured beans', sold himself, also sold his friends, Damin was immediately isolated. \\nFor Mr. Lu, it could be said to be a great deal. Isn't the son's mind just his mind! The difference is that Laozi kept the mouth like a bottle, more than ten years as a day, son thinks François is completely trustworthy and foolproof, so he is open to his mouth. \\nMr. Lu immediately took a series of urgent measures, first pleading guilt to the villains of his own factory to confess guilt: remorse his revolutionary vigilance, poor teachings, and firmly draw the boundaries with his son, pledged to mobilize his son to fight back and return to the embrace of the people. Then pleaded guilty to the villains in the streets... asking for permission to see his son and do his son's ideological work. \\nAs a result of his sincere and humble attitude, moved the street villain Attendant One, generously allowed him to meet Damin and let him do the polarization and disintegration work. Under the supervision of the rebel head, Mr. Lu met with his son, which was a wet basement, and his son had been scared, and another torture would likely put himself and his family's anti-party words and deeds out. \\nMr. Lu speaks to his son to be honest, factual, painfully aware of mistakes... and fully points out the seriousness of the nature of the problem. And repeatedly said the Communist Party Chairman Mao's grace for the road home... a word about Mr. Lu himself as a tear and tears, Darming followed the tears and tears, the leaders of the rebels were greatly moved, believing that their excitement was completely out of confession. \\nIn fact, Mr. Lu was out of urgency, Damien was out of fear. \\nEvery word Mr. Lu said to his son was a pun. He used his eyes, tone and gestures to give clear what he wanted to express. Finally, he stressed the truth of 'confess from wide, resist from strict', but this sentence is completely clear is a counter-statement, because Mr. Lu has several years at home, the month and month, the first article of 'secret home training' is: 'Keep in mind: confess from strict, firmly seated; resist from leniency, none Pardon of sins. The second article is: 'Keep in mind: a person is guilty, a person to bear; bite the teeth, strictly prevent strains.' So Damien put himself in quarantine in a blinded, deceived, looming position, admitting that he had slipped to the side of the counter-revolution. Fortunately, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary route, the cliff has the opportunity to turn back to shore, in the future, must strive to transform the worldview, become a socialist newcomer... so review a little... hollow content in the painful appearance decoration smoothly get the first of the rebellious rebellion Ken. \\nAs a result of Mr. Lu's rampant measures, Damien was classified as a crime of blind obedience and righteousness and lifted segregation as a 'target'. François naturally became the principal perpetrator, until after the Cultural Revolution to end the suffering of the prison. \\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, I was quarantined in the field. Seven years could not meet my wife and children. When I first returned to Shanghai and reunited with my wife and children late the next night, Mr. Lu suddenly visited. This is something that has never happened for more than twenty years, and I am both surprised and disturbed. \\nThis time he calls me neither a gentleman nor a comrade, but my brother. \\nHe and I had a long talk. \\nHe said to me, 'Brother! We posted our neighbor next door for more than twenty years. You should have some knowledge of our situation, and I have a little knowledge of your situation. Today we are one-on-one, no circumstantial evidence. If something happens to you, I may deny it, and if I have happened, deny it. \\nMore than twenty years of wind and rain, how did we come here, how did you come here, no one can hide from anyone, do not need to elaborate. Far relatives are not as close neighbors, I really can't live, and want to speak to you in my heart. If you feel there is nothing to do, just a gust of wind, left ear in, let it's right ear out. \\nI have long wanted to advise you, I always feel very inappropriate. You're an old qualified teenager revolutionist, what am I? A capitalist whose capital is confiscated. The only strength is how old you are, my obsession, exactly what you don't have. \\nAt that time you were scattered leaflets for the revolution, throwing your skull, spilling blood, and plunging. \\nThere are many things in Chinese culture that can survive in self-defence, and are extremely valuable. There are also a lot of noble things, like the starlight of the night tempting you, let you go back to it, in the way that you can never approach it, all over the traps, of course, you will die. \\nYou don't know the general weaknesses in human nature, don't know the mystery of relationships, no matter what society, the mysteries in relationships are approximate. In particular, you are ignorant, whether it's a complex form driven by power or money. \\nFor example: faithful words, this sentence is not only applicable to the law, but to the most sage. 'People have no far to worry about, 'and there are many speechless animals in the world much smarter than people. \\nThe most inspired me, they are undoubtedly the weakest mollusks, you noticed? From the day they were born, they were not afraid of tiredness carrying a hard shell. I have been carrying a shell for more than two decades, very heavy, very uncomfortable, but without this shell, I've been absent for a long time! \\nBrother! I know that when you get to know me, you despise me and think I'm a shameful two-sided faction. I know, but I don't think. For I am indeed a two-sided faction, and a two-sided faction that is deliberately done. Although you despise me, I'm still very grateful to you, because you just despise it, not hurt me, you are very easy in spite of your poor situation. \\nYou are noble, brother! I respect you very much. But you have paid a great price for the respect of you, and because of your noble pursuit, your wife, your son, your mother-in-law, must be discouraged from day to day, year, month and day, three hundred and sixty days a year, three hundred and sixty days a year, and washed with tears every day. \\nEvery evening, I can see your mother-in-law and your little son standing at the entrance of the last postman, quietly asking: Is there a letter from our house? Even if there is, what can you say in the letter? Every letter is scrutinized, and maybe what they expect is that you are still alive... in this respect, you may not know very well without us. Then thou shalt not see them, but I can see them every day. \\nBrother! One must have a loss, I was born to be a businessman, very important to the gains and losses. Gains and losses equal, can be considered. Too little, lost too much can not be considered! You've lost too many things! 'The song of wine, life geometry, such as the dew, go to the day bitter. ' This is Cao Cao's exclamation in the crusade Sun Quan, he was still so in his heyday, and life is very short. \\nWhen I just saw you, you were a childish face, a face of English, a face of pride. What about now? Hobby! Of course, I'm more hobby. 'People will win the day' is a fervent of the ancients. People, even the large legions under the authority of the Qin Shihuang are unable to return to heaven. He is a life whining when he is crazy for growth! 'The turtle is alive, but there is no time. ' Actually, this is a constant aspect of nature, there is Yin and Yang, death is alive, there is a round of absence, there is a start and end. \\nWe can have Cao Cao's romance, do not have to have Cao Cao's ambition... Today I can confess to you, for decades, I have to sip a cup every night, one cup, the finest French brandy, XO, no stop. \\nEven the Great Hunger in the early sixties, only you may vaguely know that I still live a bourgeois life, although it is shrinking in a small shell, in Shanghai around the day when someone is hungry with the roots of bark, someone sipping XO leisurely, if found by hungry people and know Road it's price and way, I will definitely be killed by a stick. \\nOn the bloody winter in Shanghai in 1966, old friends killed suicide every night, including the so-called bourgeois and the reactionary authority of intellectual circles. I drink like that! Although very bitter, bitter wine also want to drink! Bitter can calm me down and calm me sober, sober people can effectively defend themselves. \\nEvery moment someone is born, and someone is dead. That moment may happen to a great man, saint, perhaps a wicked man born or broken gas, I am still a good glass of wine, no increase, no reduction. You can celebrate death and mourn death. \\nBrother! I'm not saying that now you can speak freely, it is already possible to remove the masks! No! Never! Am I drunk tonight? No! I will never be drunk. I strictly abide by a commandment: never talk to another person other than myself. There is an exception to you today. \\nBecause: First of all, I'm looking for you, and you can't hurt me even for any noble or despicable reason (the damage I call has nothing to do with the quality of my brother, the old man's life will only be confused in the so-called pursuit of ideal). Please don't get wrong. I'm not referring to our living space has changed, no! Changing human living space is not as easy as radical revolutionaries imagine, it's hard! Because it is not what the object can decide, the key is the change of human nature, our nation has a famously saying: 'River and mountains are easy to change, nature is difficult to move. ' The most important thing is that I have been sick, soon after the world...\\nBrother! That's why I dared to be in front of you once again. You revolutionaries show the fearless spirit of man at the full height of your life, such as cowards like me, only at the dying of death... please forgive! Today I'm daring to open this sealed bottle in front of you for many years. Compared to you, do you say the winner is you? Or me?' Mr. Lu didn't wait for me to answer, get up and go. 'Goodbye!' \\nBy the time I wanted to chase out, he had gone upstairs. \\nI chew his words and slowly rushed to a small garden outside the door. The steel fence of the small garden was demolished 'steel' at the Great Leap Forward, and then the reconstructed brick wall was demolished again in the Cultural Revolution. Anyone could go directly under the window to supervise our reactionary family. \\nNow a new wall has been built, and the leaves of lilac are becoming more lush. \\nI planted a new cluster of bamboo and rose under the window. Bamboo can already be accompanied by Beethoven's 'Moonlight' slowly swinging, rose also began to stand on the wall towards the window sill. \\nWhat I think repeatedly at this moment is: will this high wall be dismantled again? Will this high wall be dismantled again? Will this high wall be dismantled again? When I looked up to the sky, I had seen a miraculously flashing blue star on the night sky in Shanghai, and I could not remember when I had seen such tempting starlight.

Bai chen, formerly known as Tian Zuheng, born in 1923, at the age of 81, Huaiyuan County Chengguan It is said to be a descendant of Lin Tian Geng, Bai chensheng was a member of the Chinese Filmmakers Association, a famous film artist and a long time director of Shanghai Film Studio. \\nAs a teenager, Bai left home to study abroad, began to engage with progressive ideas, participate in the revolution in early years, and engage in the construction of a new culture. In 1946 to Hong Kong, began to step into the film scene. After the film, the early film director of the film was 'the wrong period', 'the gap', 'stage art in the sky' and so on. In 1950, in cooperation with Ouyang Yuqian, he directed the opera 'Fisherman Hate', a famous film director in the early days of New China. He directed films such as 'South China Sea Wind Clouds', 'Ten Days', 'Below the Bridge', 'Spring in Autumn', 'Downhill Wind', etc., are familiar with and loved by the majority of audiences, and has won many awards from the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Radio and Television. His editorial 'Below the Bridge' won the first prize for excellent film of the Ministry of Culture, and has contributed to the promotion of modern films in China to the world. \\nWhite sank in a long career in film creation, with misfortunes and bumpy roads. In 1957, he was unfairly treated, misclassified as 'right' and forced to leave the film career that he loved for many years. In 1962, he was delegated to Anhui Repertory Theatre as an actor and director. In adversity, he was not discouraged, remained tenacious, painstakingly pursued. In 1979, he was completely repudiated politically, and then returned to Shanghai Film Studio as director. In the autumn of 1985, he led the studio team to Anhui to shoot the film 'Spring in Autumn'. White art style, good at the use of diluted treatment methods, strives to reflect deep, elegant, connotation, rustic ambition and effect, hailed as 'indoor drama' expert. \\nBai chen left his hometown for more than half a century, until his death, never returned to the forefront. However, the people of their hometown have never forgotten the son of Huaihe."}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attachment 1]Liu Zhaobin: A Review of the Life of White Plantain Books\\na\\nOn November 3, 1907, Bai jiao was born in Zhangyan Town, Jinshan County, Shanghai. In 1919, when the Bai jiao was 12 years old, the May Fourth Movement broke out, and China's political situation was mired, so in the student age, he actively engaged in the country's patriotic boom. He had served as a youth minister of Chongshan County, and started a progressive publication with progressive peasants, propagating patriotic ideas, and greeted millions of workers and farms. North warp army. In 1923, when the Bai jiao was 16 years old, farewell to his hometown, admitted to the Shanghai English school, through classmates, Xu Beihong, Zhou Leixia, Xu Jianqi, and Qi Shiyin together to join the poem club organized by Mi Sheng. Later, the White Plantain met on the right. The original works in 1926 were the calligraphy volume that co-operated with the right. After the 1927 'four, 12' counter-revolutionary coup d'état, the domestic political situation fell into white terror. Patriot youth were killed, and the white banana was out of school. After the invitation of Hong Ying Library Chairman Wong Yim Pui, to the Library as editor of the Humanities Monthly Journal, resist the outbreak of war, the library fund was depleted, and proposed to demobilize librarians. Chan proposed selection of white banana as the director of the library. During his tenure as Librarian, White Plantain wrote the book 'Yuan Shikai and the Republic of China'. It was admired by Huang Yan Pei, Liu Yazzi and Ye Chu-kui. This book is an important material for studying modern history. During the civil war, refugees were chilling, Chen's zombie streets, and the upper rulers coined, and white banana was a poem of 'Sadness Shanghai', denouncing the corruption of the authorities. \\nIn 1937, the war of resistance broke out, white banana refuge in Shanghai. He taught at Shanghai Guanghua University Secondary School, with Gao Yihong, Tang Yun, Zhang Yanfu and other organizations 'Tianfeng Painting House' and book with Guo Qinghu. At the same time, he participated in Xu Beihong's exhibition and raised donations for refugees. In 1938, the Japanese army invaded Jinshan Tsui, killing and setting fire, adultery, authorities keen in the civil war, implementing the policy of non-resistance, the white banana saw the life of the home, the intersection of sadness, in the poetry rebuke, together with friends Deng Shanmu, organized the 'cup water book exhibition', fundraising for the war, and donated charity machines Structure, relief refugees. In 1940, after the death of his father, the mother was seriously ill, Shirachoo returned to visit the country and refused the invitation of Japanese military officers. In 1941, the Bai jiao 34 years old, married with gold, Xu Beihong sent 'double green bamboo picture' in the Tang, white banana poem 'a simple' to Xu Beihong to express gratitude. \\nIn the autumn of 1948, the domestic situation was big, Baixiao returned to visit her mother. Yun County Governor invited the banana for the famous personalities of the village, personally invited the banana. White plantain can not be strong, be strong to go. At the table, Shu County Governor made a statement in the statement of the communist, as the authorities painted gold, white banana on the spot, all lost color. After being suspected of being clandestine, he was blacklisted, due to early liberation, was not poisoned. In May 1949, the liberation of Shanghai, the white banana couple actively participated in the work of the Residents Committee and supported the People's Army. This year, the Bai jiao and Deng Loose Wood co-wrote the 'pen pen', in promoting the spread of pen in China played a huge role. \\nDuring the land reform, the Bai jiao moved back to the countryside to mobilize his brother to hand over all land deeds to the government, and was invited by the county committee to make a report to publicize the policy of the land change. After returning home, Liuyazi was invited to accompany the city to visit Wuxi, Suzhou and other places. White banana returned, Liu wrote to him, and attached a letter to the East China Bureau leader, recommended white to work in East China Bureau, white banana does not want to rely on Liu's name, so the letter was not sent. After the Shanghai Municipal Committee invited Shen Ziyu, Shen Zhiyuan to come forward, hired white banana to work at the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Bureau. In the list for filling out the salary requirements, the Bai jiao examines the country's economic difficulties and only requires the living expenses of 80 units. During his tenure, he worked extensively for the restoration of the Shanghai Library, the Shanghai Art Museum, the Shanghai Chinese Painting Academy, the creation of the Shanghai Arts and Crafts Institute, and the preparation of the Shanghai Calligraphy and Sealing Institute. \\nIn 1953, autumn, the white banana went to Beijing, and Xu Beihong met, met Nansha Chong Chen Yao, book 'Stunge the poetry of the old original', and was accompanied by Xu to visit Qi Baishi, Qi old for the white banana 'banana map'. White banana stayed in Xufu for a week, on the move, Xu send white banana near a volume, the next day, Xu Beihong suddenly died, white banana for mourning, sent to Beijing friend Ai Qing, and his communicative committee. \\nIn March 1955, white banana for Huang Binhong sent, left Hangzhou for three days, colleagues Lai Shaoqi, Jiang Hanting, He Tianjian, Tang Yun, Lin Fengmian, Yan Yannian family. On February 29, 1956, Shanghai art workers 33 people went to Changshu Yushan sketchbook, four days before and after early May, with Shanghai national paintmaker Sun Xueli, He Tianjian, Qian Thin Iron, Shen Maishi, Jiang Hanting, Tang Yun, Wu Qingxia, Yu Zicai, Zhang Shoucheng and Western painting sculptor Zhang Chongren, etc. Suzhou travel sketchbook, schedule is Tianchi, Huashan, Lingyan, Tianping and Zhuoyuan Scenic Landmarks, Dongxishan Dongxiyama And with rain, no fruit went, seven days. \\nOn September 16, 1957, Qi Baishi died, Shirayan wrote 'mourning the people's artist Shiraishi Old Man', in the Xinmin Evening News, Luminous Cup, while praising the old Baishi, the article analyzes the reasons 'some painters went to life, why did not create'. This year, the fight against the right began, the white banana was mistakenly designated as the right, was relegated, demoted, and reduced salary. It was devolved to the painting theater library to manage books, and was denied creative and political rights. However, the white banana has not changed its confidence in the future and confidence of the country. On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the liberation of Shanghai, in May 1959, he made a song on the 'Cursive Word' and 'Songs of the People's Commune' and 'Poem of the People's Commune' in October. 'Night Tour' book. \\nIn 1961, the Bai jiao took off the 'right' hat, April 8, 'Shanghai Chinese calligraphy and seal engraving society' was established. In 1962, he teaches in Shanghai Youth Palace Calligraphy School organized by Mr. Shen Yin Mo. He actively assisted Shen Yin Mo and Mr. Pan Boying in their efforts to popularize and save calligraphy, making great contributions to the cause of calligraphy in New China. At this time, the art of calligraphy of Bai jiao reached Yu Feng. In 1963, he wrote 'The Long Roll of Orchid Missing' (Time Survival), and the Curb Hand Volume 'Missing Lan Sentences'. \\nDuring the Spring Festival in 1965, the white banana was invited by the Anhui Provincial Museum, Hefei Normal University, and Provincial Federation to lecture in Hefei, continue to strive for popularization and save calligraphy. In 1966, after the Cultural Revolution began, the long-sick Bai jiao was inexplicably battered, plunged home, and was crowned with many unwarranted charges such as 'cap-picking right', White strives to clarify, was designated as a 'cassation', subjected to physical sabotage, criticism, closed in a dark wet basement writing materials, painting palette, wash Pen, etc., the right to sick leave is also denied, so treatment is delayed. After being 'handled from the', wearing the 'landlord' hat, paid only $30 a month living fee, and canceled his public medical care. On February 3, 1969, early in the morning of December 17, the tortured Bai jiao passed away at the age of 61. \\nIn the short 60 years, the White Plantain has experienced historical periods such as the North Var War, the Ten Years Civil War, the War of Resistance against Japan, the Liberation War, the Fight against the Right and the Cultural Revolution. The life of Bai jiao, is the life of scholars, poets, painters, but there is no lack of consciousness and patriotic feelings. His life has served the concept of human life, transcendent, dull and, however, there is no shortage of 'the day dancer, the spirit is always in' side, in the diligent, disgusting, silently perfecting his personality, at the time of national death, he can stand up in his own words. Words and actions support anti-Japanese, singing to the motherland, manifest the noble personality of an upright intellectuals. \\nèr\\nWhite plantain self-called poem first, book second, painting third, traditional literary and art culture is quite comprehensive. In the 340s of the last century, he and Xu Beihong and Deng Sanmo were called 'Three Jade of the Art Tan', and had 'White Canna Orchid, (Shen), Shijiazhu, (Gao), Ye Hou Mei'. White banana painting only Lan, but it is deeply sighted, when people are also very high. \\nXie Zhiliu said: 'Yunjian white banana writing orchid, not the magic of pen and ink, for flowers, especially before the author unprecedented.' 'Calligraphy to write Orchid, pink butterflies, not into the previous one.' \\nShen Yuyan said: 'Calligraphy force two king, painting blue is also free.' \\nTang Yun said: 'Wanpai Zongyang wine ladle, let's talk about the good evening; he is dongfeng, and he turns over Yangzhou Zheng Banqiao.' \\nThe orchid of Bai jiao, the title is all tasteful, so in his life write their own words of the orchid. \\nShiraya art, with the highest calligraphy, generally decided that he was mainly working in Wei Jin Tang Song, especially dedicated to Jin people, but according to the data, he was still influenced by the Japanese Yujiguhara. His calligraphy is indeed obtained from his masterpieces, 'The Old Sentences of the Anchorus', and 'The Book of Poetry'. The representative writer of the 20th century, Shen Yin Mo Chang, is in a variety of styles, Wu Yu as long in the ups and downs, and the white banana is dissipating. Sun Zhenghe, a student of White Canna, once said: 'Mr. Shen Yin Mo's book style is like the wind of the Lake, clear and clear. Mr. Ma Gongyu's book style is like a wine, mellow aromatic. Mr. Deng San-mu Chaired the book style such as Yue Wang Zhidai, Yu Jun high. Mr. Shirabano's book style is such as the bamboo of Lantei. This is very insightful. \\nWhite plantain calligraphy, from early years to old age, basically underwent the process of 'chickbook-line book-cursive-cursive' process, the early many books and words independent lines, the bigger the composition of cursive books, old age has pure cursive works. Moreover, his calligraphy step by step, also 'The Magic of the Twilight,' reached the peak in 1961. \\nWhite plantain book, learn Ouyang consultation, Yu Shinan, 'recommended season straight table', 'announcement post' and two king, etc. There is a history: 'Jiucheng Palace Lichen Ming', the words of Linben and Song Tuo Ben in the sun, can coincide, for a moment to pass as beautiful. This is enough to illustrate the success of the white Jiao Kai book. White banana cursive, solid the 'writing', the most book volume. However, when it comes to pure exercise and dispersion, I am afraid to write 'Shu Shu Shing Banner's First Book Fan' in 1947, or a little later, such as the letter written to Weng Shiru in 1955. \\nThe works of the early years are mostly the books of the disbanded Caifa, or the two king's calligraphy which has not changed much, such as 'Peach Blossom' in 1940, the word is independent, written long, on the one hand from the European, Yu Kai, on the one hand, from Wang Xizhi's 'Holy Order' and other French posts, and very few 'self-saving' 'Beauty' words, 'drop' words, 'fall', such as 'fresh herbs,' English' and so on, is basically the letter of Europe, Yu; 'first avoid the Qin time' '' word, 'this person is one by one', 'this' word, 'peach flower forest, hundreds of steps' 'forest', 'number', 'hundred' and other words, are basically the original character of the king. At this time, there was no shroud of the former, but in terms of 'together with the ancient people', it has been very home. \\nWhite plantain works to around 1955, can be said to have really found the 'self', such as 1955 written 'to Weng history letter' (1, 2, 3), and on June 3, 1956 written to the writer and translator Zhou Xuliang's 'self-book volume', personal face has been very prominent, especially ink ink change, no Under the scattered forest. By 1961, the Bai jiao had learned history, and works such as 'Orchid Missing Long Volume' (Covenant in 1963), 'Misc.', etc., had reached the realm of pure blue art. \\nHu Chuanhaiyun: '('Orchid question miscellaneous'), the use of 'Ping An How · Bong Orange Post' of the safe and comfortable layout method; the flow shows the 'tips', 'Kamotou pill post' trend as a transfer skills; down down to pass the 'two thank you' dunned with a pencil method; Chun Yat (By: should be absorbed), The 'post' trend opening of the writing method.' And said: 'White plantain is not a taste of reproduction of the two king's face, fine grade can still see the difference: the white banana with a pen more pursuit of no trace, pencil relatively less; writing simplicity; line pen speed is faster; kerning arrangement also strive to change. It can be said that the Bai jiao also uses some modern pen techniques on the base of the two kings. From the suspicion of his works, avoid the suspicion of his works... White planas in the writing or line, stop pitching to wait; or the meltdown method, the line hastily attitude, in this way, it can be seen that Bai jiao is a generation master.' (Hu Chuanhai, 'Wei Jin Wind Flow', Shanghai Paintings and Painting Publishing House, 'White Canna Orchid Missing' in March 1999 edition of Bai language)\\nSha Meng Hai 'White banana orchid problem miscellaneous roll': 'Mr. Bai jiao curtain long roll, grass in the same way, san-yin, see Kung Fu. Make the second pei, not inferior. A few people have been able to do this for three centuries.' \\nThis piece of work for the white banana divided, each feeling, make up, but 'no Qi', the overall style is very uniform, sprinkling, breath dissipation, its ink ink wonderful, breathtaking, this is more than Shen Yin Mo, Pan Bo Eagle, Wu Yuru, Ma Gong Foo, Dun Shanmuzu people Place. His book is from the two kings, but has made the art language of the two kings into his own flesh and flesh, like using the 'new term he invented' to speak his voice in the old language, melting 'Jin,' and Song Ming 'will' and 'state' in a hearth, with the spirit of the spirit and skill. Clearly cooked and distinctive style. More difficult and valuable is that the works stumbled, sweeping, which is rare in other works of Bai jiao. Not only at that time, it was also a rare and excellent work. \\nIn the old age of the White Book, there seems to be a large variation, such as the two kinds of 'Mystery Words, Water Dragon' (Covenant between 1964 and 1966 before the Cultural Revolution). At this time, the white banana calligraphy seems not so elegant, the heart also seems to be a little bit, Bai jiao seems to forget the 'technique', all the ink seems to be 'flowing out from the brain', so, the work of the Bai jiao at this time, with the tormented sorrow and imminent unease, real Become a record of his own history. As Lu De Zhou Shi said: this 'old pencil cross', 'from meteorology close to Song Ming, love is good, when written in 1964 Lin Biao blow hair to the beginning of the 1966 Cultural Revolution, wrote the people who had knowledge of the great prognosis and suffering, as an unprecedented masterpiece of calligraphy of the times.' At this time, the Bai jiao has the conditions for the creation of more great works, but the Cultural Revolution that began in 1966, finally lost the life of the Bai jiao, so history left people, only a big sign. \\nThe Bai jiao calligraphy is based on grass, to meet the requirements of cursive flow, a lot of use 'curved white' and 'curved white'. We believe that this is the very different characteristics of cursive books and books: that Sun Zi's 'grass to make the shape', 'make turn' is extremely important dynamic factor, arc white and arc white component increase, this is the pencil 'turn' more than 'fold'. Yes, white and outside white polysquare, triangle, so the font is 'block', has a solid characteristics. White plantain book to obtain Ouyang consultation and Yu Shinan, is the north of the square, the white, outside the white polysquare, triangle, the end of the ancient Buddha. \\nWhite plantain early book 'Peach Blossom' black and white treatment is mostly square, triangles, liquidity is not very strong, more interesting than lyrical, but to the 'orchsia', the arc white and arc white increase, enhanced liquidity, and the word 'dragon' two more so, in The white book is the most enlightened, good at the 'secret secret of the secret', painting and painting, and not breathable. Even a collection of paintings for a painting, melting into one. Closer dense, natural sluggish, so light, rhythm have changed, received the old pen arbitrary effect. \\nAs a book author who has learned the whole history of the story, Bai Jiao Xuewei, Jin, Tang, Song, while Wei, Jin, Tang and Song can not be firmly entrenched, on the contrary, in his creations, embodied a very high degree of 'freedom'. His calligraphy, whether writing, using a pen, or ink, all show a kind of melting ability, so his word is 'round', but rather when it turns out the pen, so there is a heavy flow, ups, and frustration. \\nAs an outstanding painter, white banana calligraphy with ink, successfully draws on the composition of the painting, especially the use of fine method and light ink, dry, dare to use the method, let it melt, so works dripping, one-piece machine. Calligraphy for the use of light ink, the world praised Mr. Lin Szanzhi, as the original land of Lin, in fact, the Bai jiao's 'long roll', the creation of ink method does not let Lin old, 1956 'self-book poetry volume', even more on Lin old. \\nWhite banana painting, before the establishment of the country was very influential. In the 40s, he held numerous solo paintings and paintings exhibition in Shanghai. Some people think that he wrote the king character is the first in the present day. An example is the assessment of the Chamenhai 'White Canna Orchid Problem Overhead'. White plantain calligraphy prominent aesthetic style, can be summed up into a 'Yi' word. Writed so literally, 'pure from the human sense of culture', can be said to be the result of art, education, emotional society, Wang Xizhi 'peace, not excited', wind rules from the feeling of distant. White banana book 'Yi', is connected with the word 'light' of Bai jiao 'light', not 'dull', but 'ancient', faint, antiquity, taste, similar to orchid fragrance, not easy to detect, once detected, will flow. White plantain in the book, can sit down and rest assured, do nothing, really 'quiet' down, do not want to be quick, do not want to humane, fame is faint, fire, first in the mind reached the realm of people, plus the jinjin calligraphy grind, seasons and the habit, so can really experience 'Jin Jin Jin and freely revealed on the pen. He once worked out 'Heng, Hing, quiet' as three conditions for learning calligraphy, in fact, the three words, no one can do as good as him, modern books, can write as easy and natural as he is, I'm afraid only in the right, Huang Binhong, Xie Wun amount and so on a few people. \\nSan\\nWhite plantain's theoretical works are not many, but the quality is very high, large weight, mainly 'Yunjian Art Book', 'Ji's Poems', 'Guest Recordings', 'Calligraphy Ten Lectures', 'Calligraphy Learning Speech' and so on. His theoretical character complements his outstanding style, the famous Ten Talks of Calligraphy (See Calligraphy Journal from 1996 to 1998), for a series of calligraphy lectures made in Shanghai in 1962, with humor, clear depth, telling, home, natural and relaxed. How big and complex questions, lectures are more active than articles. As an alternative post, 'This one thing is like marriage, is a lifetime event, choose each other should take their own mind.' 'If you ask someone about the choice of posts, sometimes it's like a matchmaker in an old marriage. A matchmaker praised Miss Liu with bones; a matchmaker said Miss Sang beautiful; a matchmaker said Miss Color was well taught, came out a blessing; and a matchmaker said Miss Ouyang was both quanched and capable. So bad, even if the matchmaker says there is no illusion, your heart will inevitably rise up.' ('Option question'), such as writing writing, 'How to go to the pen, this question is and how to use chopsticks as simple and ordinary.' 'Sore loss after three months, after a year it will not shake, work to its own good.' ('Question of writing'), The pen, said 'folding stock', 'house leakage', 'planing sand', 'printing pad', 'end if lead rope', and Mi Fu's 'never to collect, no drape', etc. are derived from Cai Yong 'Tibet head guard, force in the word' eight words, 'so it seems, the discussion of the future generations, Tubes are refurbished, just like Sun Wukong a bucket of 800 thousand miles, but it is difficult to jump out of the palm of the Buddha.' ('Pen problem'), He also analyzed the 'force', 'eternal word eight', 'eight', 'eight' superstition of the 'eight'. The book medulla, said, 'probably calligraphy to the 'fire pure green', called the point of 'cooperation', must have the mood, sex, God, smell four conditions.' 'In addition to the corpus and genetic relations, the four are always learning, and are inseparable from the environment and conditions of social history. If you have a gift and do not go to school, then do not advance. (The Myeleton of Books), also demonstrates the relationship between learning knowledge and mood, the relationship between learning and sex, the relationship between learning and God, and the relationship between learning and character. They are extremely fine, limited to space, can not be counted. The monument and post, said, 'The value of the monument and post itself, can not be enlightened by direct book stone or not, the original inscriptions, regardless of the monument and post, are equally valuable'; 'Take the short, is the spirit of the art, only in this way, can improve and develop.' 'The monument can learn, and the academic posture must be a monument.' 'The monument; the post is scattered Macro rush to rough, misery to go to the side. Calligraphy is blatant and dispersed, and the gods ('Monument and post'), on God, he said, 'The words should be alive, official and god, such as silk bamboo square, and the sound of the sound; good people speak of light and shine.' White banana criticism of the former, can firmly grasp the feeling, very well put it out, such as Lan Kang with a pen, say 'like a grass rope'; on Bao Shanbo cursive pen, 'roll all the way, such as selling potion good Han show flower boxing legs.' Such theories are now too few. \\nFour\\nThe influence of white banana in life is not compared to Shen Yin Mo and others. In recent years, people found that the calligraphy of Bai jiao is higher in many places than in the contemporaries. Of the 385 paintings and painters published by the National Heritage Bureau in 2000, the white banana was listed as one of 107 people who are not allowed to leave the country. It can be said to be a certain level of calligraphy. For the evaluation of the descendants, this tortured intellectuals should be able to see if they know underground. \\nBibliography:\\n(1), Jin Xueyi 'White Plantain and Xu Beihong'. \\n(2), Jin Xueyi 'Memories of white planas-as yesterday, memory is new' (Chinese Calligraphy Law 1988, No. 3). \\n(3), Books and Paintings (2002 No. 2, Shanghai Paintings Publishing House). \\n(4), '20th Century Chinese Calligraphy Exhibition' (1997 published by China Association of Calligraphers, Federation of Chinese Literary and Art Circles, Hebei Education Press). \\n(5), Calligraphy Law (1996-1998, 1996, No. 3, 2001 No. 11, Shanghai Painting and Painting Publishing House). \\n(6), Calligraphy Newspaper (March 17, 2003). \\n(7), Dai from 'Shen Yin Mo Year'.

She wrote three memorial poems in 1973 and 1979 and 1994 respectively. \\n'Rereading the Legacy Poem: Written in the Fall of 1973 in Old Shelan\\nRemarkable poems to talk about past events, carved bones remain unstin \\nTwo windows of the moon glimpse lonely shadow, remember that year double photo. \\nThe 10th anniversary of the death of the Bai jiao in 1979\\nBrush-and-ink work this old body, will spare no effort to the people. \\nThe dragon snake dance on paper, show the reel before the beiduo God. \\n'Commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the death of Fujun White Plantain, February 3, 1994 at dawn'\\nTwenty-five years ago February 3, four hegemonic evil came. \\nInjustly silent spring to go, this hate endless mourning. \\nToday again in February 3, sad again is broken. \\nOnly the soul dream meet, so hug lonely but I mourn. \\nA day more than ten years ago, Mr. Master Jin took a hand roll from the inside room to show me a poetry written by the banana division. Only the volume does not have a banana division: 'ancient poetry chapters, thirty years I learn Yee Ye Zhi, yet unmarried. After checking out and showing me, looking back, more heavy books, old husband is more sick, because I learn Yi Jian also. Resurrection. According to his mother's announcement, the original, was given more than 70 years ago for the Fujun Bai jiao. In 1965, before the Cultural Revolution, she took out to watch, was seen by the banana teacher, believing that it was poorly written at that time, and rewritten it. \\nThis hand roll has a total of more than 20. The seven of them are now recorded in order to show a glance. \\n'Butterflies and flowers' a que: who sent glass flower motion, quietly molten, want to follow a few people.

Starting this week, the painting and calligraphy exhibition will be on display at the Shanghai Museum of Brushes and Ink. \\nmeet each other\\nMr. Master Jin talked to me about the first to know the banana teacher. \\nAfter graduating from the Normal School in 1931, the teacher taught her classes by Mr. Cao Zhongfu introduced to Jinshan Zhangyan Town Elementary School. Before the school starts, teacher Cao set up a banquet. During the table there were not only Mr. Mother Jin and her colleagues, but also Mr. Shirabana and his fellow students. The original teacher Cao was not only a hometown of Mr. Shirabana, but also a teacher of his primary school as a teenager. In that year, Mr. white banana suit leather, the wind is mao, he is personable, talking about laughing style, giving a very impressive impression. At the table, Mr. Master Kim also noted that Mr. Shirabana often covered his mouth with a handkerchief, four, somehow. Later it was known that the white banana self-conceded misaligned, there was a bleak, so with a handkerchief as a cover. \\nIn the 1930s, Mr. Baixiao has been editor in Shanghai Humanities Monthly, usually rare to return to Jinshan's home. In one case, the primary school held sports meetings, and the teacher mother Kim did not attend but was preparing classes. And Jiana teacher returned home just passed the playground, did not see Mr. Jin, so asked the sports teacher, how not to see Jin teacher, the sports teacher is a Shanghai urban person, know that Mr. Bai banana is a famous calligraphy, after telling the truth, then went to Mr. Jin's family, to go to Mr. Jin to go to the white banana home, seek the rubble, Mr. Shirabano received them in the study room and met the request, and left in a hurry. Later, the teacher mother Jin went to Nanjing Silkworm Mulberry Middle School to teach, and she and Mr. Baiyana did not communicate a message. \\nIn 1934, due to the fire of Nanjing Silkworm Sang Middle School, Mr. Jin had to return to Shanghai. With the support of her family and friends, she created a 'whole person primary school' in Yapei Road (now South Shaanxi Road). When Mr. Master Jin started running the school, also from the old photo book, showed me photos of the time at the time of class, such as Photo of jumping rope, jumping higher sports class. In that year, Mr. Shirabana also worked in the Humanities Monthly Journal, not far from the whole person primary school. The most important thing is that there is a female teacher in the whole person primary school and is familiar with Mr. Shirayana, which often goes to the whole person primary school. According to Mr. Master Mother Jin, this colleague often talked about the anti-marriage history and his family situation, and said that he lived alone in a unit dormitory room, often borrowed wine, intoxicated and intoxicated, after work, burning incense meditation, feeling sad autumn, did a lot of sentimental poetry. \\nUnder the contact for a period of time, Mr. Shijianao is a humble, versatile, sentimental person, pity, misfortune, by compassion and gradually produce goodwill. Once, he gave Mr. Jin a package of gifts, after walking to open a look, wrapped in more than a dozen white paper, and the last bread was a white banana flower. At that time, Mr. Jin somehow, thought repeatedly, Fang knew that Mr. Shirabana wanted her to free him from the layers of misery. \\nMr. Shirayana and her mother were in love for many years before marriage, amateur day, the two people often talk, sometimes talk about midnight, and often have poetry gifts. \\nAccording to the memory of Mr. Master Jin, Mr. Shirabana often made poems in a dream, wake up to record preservation. Before marriage, the master mother received a 'dream met last night':\\nA dark cloud is snow-wrist, last night dream met,\\nAttention vs. Acacia, Yan and Lang Che. \\nIt was in the 1950s that he made a verbal poem 'Young Dreams, Dreaming, September 30, 1954, 2:30 a.m., and 4 when writing poems unwritten'\\nPeople sleep together, dreams are doing access. \\nTouch a couple of bay, chagrin not seeing you. \\nWake up pushing you, side-down the sweet child. \\nLet you laugh! This age, a young dream. \\nI opened the light to see you can't open your eyes, how do you say, don't turn around yawning. \\nLove is always young, just to make people young, laugh! Laughing! \\nI love to see you laugh, but don't say I'm old. \\nIn 1936, due to the influence of the current situation and various social reasons, Mr. Master Mother Jin's all-person primary school was suspended. Mr. Shirabana, a famous piety son in the countryside, promised his father to go home after his 30 years old, if his future is uncertain, to inherit his family medicine. In 1937 he resigned from the Hongying Library and Humanities Monthly Journal, returning home to serve his parents. \\nmake a difference\\nFrom the first meeting between Mr. Baishiao and his mother in 1931, the two people after tough and twisting years, finally on June 8, 1942 held a wedding at Dundtimo Hotel, Nanjing Road, Shanghai, and since then, they finally joined together. \\nAt the beginning of this century, I had the privilege of seeing her couple's marriage books and poems before and after his ninety high life. Through timely inquiries and answers, the circumstances of these objects show a mutilated emotional world, adding a piece of information for the future study of Mr. Shirabana's life and art ideas. \\nThis marriage certificate was drawn by Mr. Tang Yun, a friend of the banana. Whole wedding book vertical 24 cm, horizontal 97 cm. At the beginning of its right, Tang Yun question signed the 'Golden Sands Soft Figure' line, under 'Renyu \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), Summer Tang Cloud' words. This certificate is painted with two pink brute-lotus flowers on the front, with two turquoise lotus leaves beside the flower, more beautiful. In the lower right corner there is a pair of loving female mandarin ducks, up and down with water bamboo and water grass. Lotus, lotus leaf and mandarin double pairs to show their marriage perfect harmony, white head to old. And the second half of the certificate is painted with blooming pomegranate flowers, flowers are bright as fire, there are also two abundant pomegranates hanging between the branches, saying that the pomegranate open hundred, meaning that the children are full of Tang. \\nIn the middle space part of this marriage certificate, a small real book written by Mr. Shirabano personally wrote the spirit of Jintang to document the legal rules of their couple's marriage. \\nThe text reads as follows:\\nHe Huifu, 36 years old, Jinshan County, Jiangsu Province (stamped). Jin Huici, 32 years old, Qingpu County, Jiangsu Province (stamped). Present by Mr. Yao Boli and Hu Liangsheng in the Republic of China for 31 years, the wedding ceremony was held in the auditorium of Deng Tama Hotel in Shanghai, please Mr. Ding Guanyi's marriage (faint): good coupling early, good edge eternal meaning. Look at this time peach blossoms, IKEA IKEA. Buttha year melodious, Erchanger. This card. Marriage: Ho Wai Fu (stamped), 'Ji Lu', Kim Hui-tsi (stamped), 'Hui-Chi'. Introducer: Yao Boli (stamped), 'Berli', Hu Liangsheng (stamped), 'Hu Liangsheng Yin'. Marriage (faint), person: Ding Guanyi (stamped), 'Ding Renke'. Main Married: He Xu Baojing (stamped), 'Xu Baojing', Jin Huying (stamped), 'Jin Hu Ying'\\nROC 31 June 8\\nWhen I first watched this marriage certificate, I noticed the middle part of the text, and immediately asked the teacher Mr. Jin, why did he call himself why Huifu, and your name is Jin Huici? Who are those other people? Master replied: 'Because I was originally named Jin Huici, after sending dad Yao Berli changed its name to learn instrument. In writing the marriage certificate, your teacher wants to return to his surname, my name Huici, and he calls himself Huifu. Hu Liangsheng is my uncle, and the wedding witness Ding Guanyi is the principal of the Pudong Sanlin Middle School, is your friend of your banana division. His married wife He Xu Baojing is the mother of white banana, and Jin Hu Ying is my mother.' \\nAt the time of the wedding, it happened that Professor Jiang Meisheng and Ms. Jiang Biwei both lived in Chongqing, Sichuan, while Jiang Shi Mu lived alone in Liansengli, near Jing'an Temple in Shanghai. Mr. Xu Beihong had another small house vacant in Nanjing, so Ms. Biwei took her mother to live in Nanjing. Allowed the vacant house to the white banana couple for new housing. \\nMr. Beihong learned that the white banana golden scholar couple married, specially sent a middle hall 'double blue picture', painted on two tall and stout bamboo, standing in the center, above the poetry cloud: 'More than leave the shadow, the age of cold, mo with grass, only hot look.' They had this great work, delighted, immediately made a poem 'generation of Jane a' sent to the friends of Beihong to thank. I saw in the 'double blue picture' on the edge paper written by the banana teacher 'morning pillow before drunk back, Ming Han's ancestors come. Is he Li Xiong and Jie, for poetry more open. Heaven to stay double rod in, snow frost did not send a heart. When is Gangnam Demon Dream? Often make the clouds put the glass.' Recently, in the 'declaration' before the founding of the country, I found that Mr. Baixiao published 'Happiness Hong double bamboo axis and answer the recent situation on behalf of Jane II'. Originally there were two, now a new record is ready to refer to later. 'Spring River Road is far dust, short heart reinstated, idle day to see flowers alone, neighbor monk drink often come, let his prices rise, no matter the color of the people, under the lamp three cups of two wine, divine feisce guessing.' \\nOne more interesting thing happened on the wedding day. Mr. Deng Sanmu, a friend of white banana division, sent a gift wrapped with large red paper, Mr. Deng repeatedly said: 'Not open now, I need to wait for me to leave and then open the seal.' After waiting for guests to go to the seats, they went home to open a look. Originally more than twenty layers of red paper wrapped in two sides of the seal, for the loose wood, a 'flower a good moon', a 'big jiji'. The two sides will be used to use when writing plum. I only saw the original print of 'Daji', and the 'spend a good moon' side, in the early days of the 'Cultural Revolution' was worn away. \\nMr. Master Kim left the world on 4 November 2008 at the age of 98. 38 years apart, they finally met in the kingdom of heaven. \\nPAGE 12"}

It is good to speak out in the belly. It is better not to say any anti-Communist Party or anti-socialism. The criticism of the 'party world' in the newspaper is questionable. \\nI think that the 'party world' is more or less there. It is proposed this way to protect the Party is strict to the requirements of the Party and give the party a vigilance. If the Party's leadership works well, there is no opinion, and if it is not done well, there is an opinion. Raising the slogan 'Party world' is not the leader of the opposition, but the deep love and responsibility. \\nI don't understand the national situation. Let's take my school to say that 'the party world' is some facts exist. It can be seen from the following aspects:\\nFirst, school sectarianism is serious, with more than 90% of leading cadres being party members. \\nSecond, from the big print newspaper, there are many Party members who have not done good work, such as 'such secretary' as Cai Sen, Shao Mingsan, Ban Mengyang and other people, are they not working properly? But the work is not done well. \\nEvery unit must always send a party member to do the head, as if not to put a party member at ease. If the accounting department has Qi Wenbin, the chief of section doesn't have to put Wang Fengqi, Cai Sen, Wang Baoenvironmental and others now have Li Tong and Chen Shuguang. The director of the library has also changed several party members, Kim Senghua, Bai jiaqigo and Masilin. Li Chunxiang in the health care room has authority and wants to join the party, but what he gets is blows and reprisals. The Supply Section also sent a Chief Wang Section. Actually, I did not see what work Wang Ke is doing. \\nThe University does not trust non-party comrades enough, believes in party members, and sectarianism is serious. \\nThird, in promoting cadres, 'to be long must join the Party' is appropriate at the Labor University. The workers went out of the big print newspaper to say that they were not in order to be long, but the workers were only a small part of the workers who were long after joining the party, such as Wang Haiting, Chen Qinglin, and Cui Ming, who joined the party, were deputy directors of sections. Can they not be cultivated or promoted? \\nFourth, the same is true of the Rusuu issue. As can be seen from the big print newspaper, Rusu individual masses are only accompanied by the list. \\nFifth, the party mass relations are not good, party members special, party members are correct, the party members say even at work. In fact, some very good, but some are not good, give people feel special. \\nSixth, the closing of the party development organization, and the distance from the masses, is man-made, and party members 'can cause it, not to know' for non-party members. \\nOn the issue of joining the party, Wang Huimin's entry into the party is not enough, causing doubt. In this investigation materials, Comrade Gu Jingqing has four times to look at Wang Huimin's material. Why not let it look? It is a sectarianist emotion. \\nSeventh, the party's decision is an administrative decision, such as the allocation of students to the party organization and personnel office. \\nJust now, Zhang Xiasheng criticized several leaders of the General Affairs Department for not attending the trade union membership conference, and immediately went to work Mengyang to put forward their opinions. Why is this? Not coming should be criticized. \\nDemocratic life in schools is not enough. Some problems are discussion by party organizations and administrative adoption, not to solicit the views of everyone. Such as organizational issues. \\nEighth, the public supervision of the school's work is poor, such as welfare fees everyone has a lot of opinions. \\nIt can be seen from the above aspects that the fact that our school 'party world' exists. \\nWhat is the root of sectarianism? Individuals are personally responsible, but who is the organization responsible for it? What is the connection with the party world? Strict analysis is the party world. \\nWhy is party organizations making mistakes about party members? \\nToday, it is not a celebration ceremony to help the Party to rectify the wind, and the praise party should raise more negative opinions. This is also a learning for yourself. Some opinions are not to negate the party's leadership. I also asked to join the party, not enough conditions for the party to cultivate it. \\nMy comments are not necessarily comprehensive, and I hope you can make a different opinion, but don't hold a hat or say anything about anti-communist or anti-socialism.

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached]Party Group of the CPC Guizhou Provincial Post and Telecommunications Administration: 'Organizational Conclusions on the Right Element White Crystal Five'\\nBai jingwu Jing V, director of Guizhou Provincial Post and Telecommunications Administration, Party Secretary, is a outright bourgeois right, hidden within the party, is a pioneer of anti-socialist anti-socialism. His anti-party words and deeds, long before the wind (February 1, 1957), had been fully and completely exposed in a letter to the provincial committee (word book). There is also a series of anti-party words and deeds. Until the beginning of the whole wind exercise, it continues to put poison. His anti-socialist anti-socialist words and deeds are mainly:\\n(1), attacking party organizations and leading cadres, resisting the party's leadership, splitting with the party, and treating the post and telecommunications department as its own independent kingdom. Bai jingwu Jingwu struggled to attack the Party not paying attention to postal and telecommunication work. He not only compared China and the Soviet countries with capitalist countries, but also slanded China's postal and telecommunications work less than capitalist countries. He said: 'The Soviet Union and many capitalist countries attach considerable importance to post and telecommunications, and China, especially the Guizhou Party, is still not quite aware of this issue.' This is essentially a neglection of the socialist system, glorifying and promoting the capitalist system. His opposition party's unified leadership of postal and telecommunications work, defaming the provincial committee is 'hallist' and 'central-work unionism'. 'Only believe in the group of people under their leadership, do not know the family of the postal and telecommunications system' and claim to be 'outsiders within the party', openly opposed to the party chamber. He also attacked the Central Ministry of Post and Telecommunications, which is a 'huge, large, high-ranking bureaucratic institution'. He can't master the 'highly concentrated and highly dispersed' of the postal and telecommunications work, regardless of the small province of Guizhou, the guiding ideology is 'big provincialism'. It completely negates the leadership role of the Central Ministry of Post and Telecommunications. He preached that laymen were not enough to lead the insiders, believing that the party 'is blind ignorant of science and new things,' and cannot lead the postal and telecommunications work that 'can't enter the door for a year and three years can't be familiar'. Only they have 'experts' that 'drill into one eye' for a long time, and engage in 'two generations and three generations' in a row 'Generation' of the old staff, to get a good job in postal and telecommunications. As a result, in his work, he often showed resistance and dissatisfaction with the leadership of the party, and to charge the instructions of comrades in charge of the provincial committee, often adopts an attitude of blame and discredit the leadership when he leaves the door. He verbally abused his leadership in extremely vicious words until the Central Committee was in charge of comrades. Not only did he resist the leadership himself, but also incited cadres in the post and telecommunications department to join him in opposition. He took advantage of the grievances of some cadres regarding wages and other aspects, provoking them to remember hate the provincial committee and attack the provincial committee, and he was a good person from it. He openly issued an anti-party mobilization order at the shadowing postal conference, instructing the county director to 'do not go all the way to the county committee. If the county governor criticizes you are monolithic, you tell him that this is socialism'. He is also extremely dissatisfied with the transfer of post and telecommunications cadres from county and municipal committees to work in the center and to transfer the post and telecommunications cadres. In short, Bai jingwu Jing Five resists the leadership of 'strip' and resists the 'block' leadership, trying to make Guizhou Post and Telecommunications Department, become an independent kingdom. \\n(2), Distorting the Party's policy and policy, especially the systematic and comprehensive attacks on cadre policy. Bai jingwu Jing Five scorn in 1956, bold promotion of cadres was 'leaving aside the policy of cadres with both merit and talent, avoiding the old cadres, and catching new cadres', 'fiery as crazy as the sky', completely negates the achievements of the promotion of cadres in 1956. In particular, the indiscriminate attack on the provincial committee has sectarianism in the implementation of cadre policy. It is hard to say that the Provincial Committee 'look at people with colored glasses'. There is 'biased and stereotyped' for postal and telecommunications cadres, grabbed a little disadvantage, 'to determine the coffin for life', or 'when the braids come to pull, as a substitute for controlling the steering wheel of the car or the tight spell of Tang Sanzang'. The cadres of the lobby bureau were 'even promoted to three levels, a full set of promotions', while the postal and telecommunications department did not mention one. This is 'hallism' and 'central-work unionism', which puts postal and telecommunications cadres 'behind their ears'. He litigated and stigmatized his comrades near the provincial committee and his comrades close to the leadership of the provincial committee, saying that Guizhou Provincial Committee 'Xing activities', some leading cadres 'take the opportunity to develop personal worship' among their bold and bold promotion cadres. Curse provincial leaders 'pants where the fox tail is hidden'. Cursed close to the leadership comrades have 'eunuch style'. He even more comprehensive attacks said: 'The Communist Party is a sectarian bloc, and if it does not keep the wind, the Communist Party will become the Kuomintang.' This fully demonstrates that his relationship with the party has been completely antagonistic. While attacking sectarianism in the provincial committee, he also attacked the provincial committee and ravaging localism, saying that when the provincial committee mobilizes cadres in the central department, 'repressive strips motivate people's rights and build blocks.' Attempts to provoke the relationship between the provincial committee and the central department. Its intentions are very vicious. \\nWhite Crystal Five attack cadres policy is clever. He appeared in the face of 'holding justice' and said that he defended the interests of cadres in his department and tried to exaggerate the talents of the cadres of his department, in order to solidify the hearts and nurture private forces as anti-party capital. He used to explain that the Provincial Committee intends not to promote 'outstanding' cadres in the postal and telecommunications department, and at the same time, to stigmatize the cadres of other departments, and use this as a basis for accusing the provincial party party sectarianism. He declared that the cadres in the postal and telecommunications department are 'old qualifications, good quality will not be frightened, and they will not disregard them all day. Outside the home, has long established the correct view of life and career, blow to pull people can not come here', 'On There are a variety of recognized experts in the business'. Officials in other departments are slandered as 'sleeping king, slack experts, paid workers. The cadres promoted are not comparable to those in the postal and telecommunications department, and a section chief of the post and telecommunications administration is also more than the deputy minister of the provincial committee.' 'By politics, based on theory, business knowledge, with the footprint of the party over a half-life, with certain levels of understanding, the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee is not at his moment.' He frenzily wants to 'change shifts and see who works, who can't work,' he even threatened the party to say that the incorrect cadre policy has brought ununity to the leadership of the Post and Telecommunications Bureau. If he does not meet his personal desires, he 'can't unite positive factors to move forward', 'there will be a dispute, and it will be chaos., will bury the cause of the revolution'. Worse yet, he saw the party as the ruling class of the feudal dynasty, claiming that he was 'a man who did not break the back for five buckets.' White Crystal Five completely lost the party's position. \\nBai jingwu Jingwu also has many contradictions and dissatisfaction with other policies of the Party, and refuses to implement the Party's policy and policies. In the middle of the wind, he stood in a counter-offensive position to look at the opinions and right-wing statements emanating from the provincial committee propaganda meeting. Thought that 'all ran too fast in 1956.' He is not in favor of the way that the wind is carried out by a big magnification and a big word. He was afraid of a vigorous campaign of sweeping, advocating the organization of armed forces to stand on duty. On the other hand, on the other hand, he has repeatedly mobilized the masses in unprincipled words, saying that everyone 'don't be afraid to speak, nor let it go back to the counter-revolution.' In fact, it has played an instigating role. When the Central Committee called on cadres to participate in manual labor, the masses discussed enthusiastically. However, he said, 'It is not economical to do this,' and said that Governor Zhou participated in manual labor, 'is formalism' and negates the significance of leading cadres participating in manual labor. In successive struggles against the enemy, the postal and telecommunications sector has always been viewed as having a serious right-wing view, but in fact, 22 counter-revolutions have been identified in the rebellion, with 29 right-wing elements appearing in the whole wind. He also had dissatisfaction with the general purchase and sale of grain. After returning from his hometown in Shandong in 1954, he described the farmers' life after the implementation of the purchase and sale, very stressful, very painful. \\n(3), Revisionist fallacy on international issues. Bai jingwu Jing V denied that the Bohung incident was due to the riots by anti-revolutionaries at home and abroad, and believed that 'because the leaders of the two parties in Bohung and Hungary had made serious mistakes and had not changed for a long period of time, the people were suffering in their lives and did not even burn coal, so the people rose up to riots.' As for the Berlin events of 1953, this argument was also spread, arguing that 'mainly because the GDR focused only on the development of industry, making food a problem, so that the popular riots'. This argument of White Crystal Five is in tune with the international revisionist, imperialist walking dog Tito. \\n(4), completely lost their position, repeatedly sheltered bad people and tried to defend the crimes of anti-revolutionaries, right-wing elements, and bad elements. According to the public, there are more than 10 people before and after he sheltered anti-revolutionaries, right-wing elements, and bad elements. He defended his rebellion, and he advocated a misdemeanour sentence for serious crimes. When the anti-fighting team struggles the bad man Liu Tizhi, he was Liu Bangqian and gave comfort, believing that the masses were 'fighting over fire.' causing anger and dissatisfaction among the masses. After he came back from Beijing's senior party school, he paid four accounts to the Party. First, he described the leap forward in 1956 as a risk-taking, negating the achievements of the 1956 leap forward. Second, the criticizing Bureau of other leading comrades 'to master the anti-revolt policy is too unstable'. It is also wrong, and it is also wrong to account for the counter-revolutionaries and negate the reversals. Performance; third, criticizing cadres, and four, criticizing intellectuals who have made mistakes, and put their claims to the one Bad elements are also counted on the party group's account. He went back to previous movements and said that 'several campaigns have offended several people' and expressed deep mercy on the enemy. In the middle of the wind, he blatantly sheltered the right, Yao Jiyu, disagreed to be classified as the right, and even used Yao Dang activists. Usually Kuao Yao is a 'red expert' and privately approved a group of people headed by Yao (most of them politically problematic people, six of them have become the right), to set up a 'Guiyang City Post and Telecommunications Youth Literary Creation Group', and in the internal publication Guizhou Post and Telecommunication (some poisonous herbs), in fact Help them build anti-party bases. He also offered to use another right-wing element as a center-right marker. Not only does he know not only about a bad man in the game, but when the masses reveal it, they also conceal criminal acts for their ideas. He arbitrarily engages people with political problems and hatred towards the party. and repeatedly advocated the inclusion of some people with problems with political history into the party. White Crystal Five has completely and the enemy stand on a stand. \\n(5), Always spread rumors, slander, fight others, elevate themselves, create personal worship, even pull and pull, carry out sectarian activities. For more than five years, Bai jingwu Jing has often stigmatized and hurt other leaders comrades, elevated himself, and its attacks have reached the point of having you without me; and does not want to reduce the authority of the party to establish personal prestige, so that the masses worship themselves. He made every effort to retaliate against those who made sharp opinions, and he had done everything possible to fight against some people, such as Nie Qihui and Jiang Zhigang, who had cooperated with each other, to exclude dissidents. They tried hard to pursue and deliberately combat retaliation against those who wrote the book anonymously. In 1952, when Nie Qihui (formerly deputy director of transport department, right), went to Majiang land reform, embezzled the fruits of the struggle and brought the drugs back to Guiyang. Bai jingwu knew not to ask, sheltered the matter. White often praised Nie, ginger, work consistently reuse; Nie, ginger also worship to the five bodies. The five officials of Bai jingwu Jing promised Zhang Jinpan, who had been promoted, promised the head of the Bureau, and were ready to transfer him to school to study, so that Zhang worship him very much. White Crystal Five has its historical roots and ideological roots as a bourgeois right. \\nWhite Crystal Five is an exploitative class (rich farmer), family origin, has a strong sense of feudal exploitation class and strong fame views, he once said: 'If I do not participate in the revolution, I may become a runner.' (His father was a Muslim runner), That fully reflected his leader's desire to bring this kind of exploitative class thinking into the revolutionary camp and the party. He joined the party for nearly 20 years, but his reactionary bourgeois ideology not only has not been radically transformed for a long time, but has also grown and developed, and has always used the party's cause as a tool for personal gain. So, at a critical juncture in the history of the socialist revolution, he finally turned the party. \\nWhite crystal five, has always measured status, treatment, arrogant arrogance. Not only is he not only shameful to be a class 9 cadre, governor of major provincial governors, design dean, provincial committee standing member; he also loves money like bourgeoisists, and sees payment of dues, rent and utilities and even party fees as damaging his personal interests. He argued for the credit and hard work of building Guizhou, he wants the provincial committee to give him a few more money, thinks that only in this way can make him 'more positive and enjoyable contribution for life'! He even instructed other cadres who had to meet in Beijing to make money through trade and trade, which could be seen as seriously damaging the idea of self-interest. When his despicable personal desires are not met, he remembers hatred of the party and his leadership. As far as 1941, when he was revoked as county governor for violating the prisoner policy and staying in the party inspectorate, he had a longstanding revenge against Comrade Zhou Huan, who was dealing with the issue at that time. Soon after the liberation of Guiyang, the Provincial Post and Telecommunications Bureau went out of the province in violation of the arms control council ban, and was reported for criticism. He also believed that Comrade Fu Jia election (then the construction takeover minister), deliberately gave him unsightly, and also remembered hatred. When a large number of cadres promoted in 1956, he did not turn his turn, he was even more opposed to the party. The words written to the provincial committee in 1957, he always revealed his ideas of hate party leadership over the years. At the same time, he has for a long time treated the trust that the Party and the people have given him as a personal proud capital, arrogant arrogance and nothing, than that, he always thinks that others are less than himself, and in terms of status and treatment, he thinks that he is a loss. He claims that, regardless of that, 'I do not admire a standing committee or a certain executive committee', in fact, he has long set aside the cause of the party and became a mingist. He often leaves late and commuting, and he does not even look at the content when he approves documents, and does not reach out to the masses. Learning is also bodily, according to his own words, 'learn by interest', 'learn a little as capital'. He increasingly likes the glorification and blow of him by others, is reluctant to listen to inverse rhetoric, and even to adopt the means of Shun Zhichang and the death of the subordinate cadres. In short, Bai jingwu Jing Five has long been confronted with bourgeois individualism and party organizational principles, driving individuals above the organization. Its essence is to create chaos within the party in the cloak of Marxinism. Attempts to weaken and abolish the party's leadership in order to realize its personal ambitions. \\nThe Party's salvation of the White Crystal Five is meritorious, and has repeatedly waited and inspired him to speak to the party consciously, while he always insists on reactionary stance, obsessed, holding a confused attitude. At the provincial committee level 4 cadres meeting last November, he first was afraid to classify him into the right. After seeing criticism of other comrades, he said: 'The pride of heaven, the pride of the party' in the hall bureau also made mistakes. Since December of last year, began to criticize him in the party, the party still wants him to look back, but he thinks that his criticism is a 'small work', deliberately and he 'can't go'. At the five enlargement meetings of the provincial committee in February this year, the party once again gave him a chance to repent, while he continued to play two ways, the Assembly Inspect, little will overthrow, die holding decayed bourgeois individualism and continue to put poison saying: 'I have to the party A lot of jaundice, there are past, there are present, not how to pass, days can not come out.' And he said, A woe of a letter will not cause me for a lifetime. He claimed to go to Beijing to 'ask Chairman Mao whether he can give opinions on issues within the Party, whether there is democracy within the Party'. He even repeated the bad notes of the hate party in the 'book of words', continued to attack the party and sneakly eaved the group meeting. After ordering him to suspend his duties in mid-June, he conducted public criticism among the masses, and then in the provincial committee chaired a meeting of the department director and the 11th postal and televised conference of the province, after many criticisms, had to bow to plead guilty. According to the above information, Bai jingwu Jingwu is an old right-wing element hiding in the party for a long time. Through the study of our Bureau and the leading group of the brigade, he was given to abolish the posts of secretary and secretary of the party group. Expulsion of party membership, administrative downgrade 3 (from level 11 to level 14). (Centrally Approved), (1958.9.9), [Repertory (5)\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 4"}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached]Ye Weili: 'Turbulent Youth: The Daughters of the Red Courtyard'\\nThe families of both my parents were out of the right. My father's side are my Sambuya and the Five Boye Tuk\\n, and my mother's three uncles. Over the years, I sometimes wonder how my parents, as cadres of the Communist Party,\\n endure the fact that their hands and feet are suffering? How do they say in the face of the 'organization'? \\nHow are they in mood? Think about these issues that make me feel uncomfortable for them. \\nI don't know what my parents say in the unit. At home, they never told us to draw the boundaries with which relatives with political problems we have maintained close relations with their families. At the same time, they are very conscious of not talking about things before us, but slowly I know a little bit. \\nI Sambok sometimes came to our house, and I remember once he came in a robe. Everyone was 'short dress up' at that time, wearing tunic and the like, his outfit was like someone coming out of another era. He spoke, and the words were not the same as the 'revolutionary words' I heard outside. I went to his house and saw him writing in a small room with a foreign dictionary on the table. Later, I knew that when he was on the right, the daily work of the NLD was gone and worked on interpreters. His translation of 'English make a contribution to Qianlong documentary', text and pen fluency, can now be bought in the bookstore. \\nCompared to me, I am lucky. Not only became the right, but I also put on top of the 'historical counter-revolution' hat, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\\n \\nBecause of the Cultural Revolution, his sentence was not released, and spent many years on a labor farm. When I was young, I was the most politically radical among my family brothers. On his proposal, my father and some other brothers used the money they had received after their separation to help the Communist Party to organize bookstores in Tianjin as cover for secret activities. \\nAlthough I did not join the Communist Party later, I have been leaning on the left politically and have close ties with the Communist Party. The so-called 'historical counter-revolution' was actually what the communist clandestine organization asked him to do in the 1940s. I am also a member of the NLD, which was the hardest hit 'disaster area' of all 'democratic parties' in 1957. Among my father's brothers, I think that the most talented are my rightist beauties. I am well versed in both English and French languages and was well educated in school, and his clever man was recognized in his family. I Wobo is an expert in translation and research in Darwin in China. My two Bobber examples let me know long ago that the right is often the best intellectuals in China. \\nI was very young to know that Wobo 'went wrong.' Whenever my three aunts come, the adults close their doors to whisper, and\\n I know that there is another news of Five Boys. Three gu is a family woman, and the letter of five boils are sent to her,\\n so it will not give other relatives and friends to find trouble. When I was twelve and three years old, I went to Tianjin\\n Dabubo home with a daughter of Wubo for guest. 'Grandma'-her biological mother-lives there. Grandma was my grandfather\\n's 'big aunt' and 'girl' from her 70s, she was a small and thin old lady. She saw the daughter of Wuber coming, how many times stood by the door of the room where we lived, cowardly wanted to ask what and dare not open. \\nI had assumed that Grandma must have wanted to hear about Wubab. For so many years, she didn't know what happened to her son. Until now I remember clearly the misty face of Grandma. \\nOur family has a clay pot specializing in Yunnan gas pot chicken. Every time my mother took it out, he would say that this\\n is five Bol's, and when he comes out, he will return it to him. Because of this terracotta, we are constantly reminded of the\\n existence of Wuber. Several daughters of Wubo often come to our house to play, and five women come to my mother to consult. I\\n later knew that my dad wanted to help Wobber 'turn over' when the political situation was relatively loose in 1962, and then the situation suddenly became nervous, and the string of 'class struggle' was tight, and my father had to give up. In the Cultural Revolution, the 'anti-revolutionary brother' case was a crime for him. \\nMy mother's three brothers were also right-wing. My mother's brother and two brothers died in the hands of the Japanese in the war of anti-Japanese, only three brothers who survived. Uncle Three is also my very respected elder. He was more than 10 years older than my mother, and studied in Japan in the 1920s. He was proficient in literature, history and philosophy, writing a good calligraphy. Compared to me some 'westernified' Bobo, he had something deeper in his body 'Kong Mengzhi Road', and there were more rules for young and inferior in his family. By age, he was older than my burbs, and was a teenager in the age of 'May Fourth'. He worked at a high school in Beijing before the right. After being beaten to the right, he lost his public office and was assigned to a forest farm in the suburbs of Beijing. My three uncle's only son became the right, in a tea house in the south. \\nMy uncle will come home from the forest farm for a while, and my mother went to see him and sometimes took me with me. He\\n shaved a bald head, tall and skinny, and some camel in his One scene I never forget is that my mother and my\\n uncle, brother and sister, sitting in the corner of the house and speaking softly in the light of dusk. Looking back to this scenario today, I wonder why I would have some nose acid. After my uncle and son became the right, the family broke economic sources, and\\n my uncle had to sell my uncle's beloved antique painting to sustain life. Since then, my mother received my uncle's family every month\\n, sometimes she was lame, took the tram in person, sometimes his family came to pick up, many years as a day, the 'Cultural Revolution' did not stop. I only recently learned that my mother received my uncle's family and was approved by the organization. His family often came to collect money from my uncle's daughter-in-law, a woman from the countryside in Guangxi. After her husband became the right, she took three children to Beijing and worked in a street factory. When I was a child, I was often not friendly enough to her, like a rich lady treated a poor relative. She seemed to be strange, and she said the Guangxi taste Putonghua greatly. The arrogance and contemplation of others for her humble status is a routine routine in survival. \\nMy uncle's family lived in a small courtyard in an alley near Xisi, which I used to go from a young age. \\nHe is the landlord, home home, and three tenants live in the East and West and South House respectively. Neighbors are kind and gracious and call\\n each other 'you', unlike in the Xinhua News Agency compound, to whoever is 'you'. In Xinhua News Agency, I manage that people are always called 'uncle, aunt,' and in my uncle, I have to call 'Uncle, Big Mother.' The etiquette and title of the compound and the alley are different, and the social order reflected is different. From this point of view, campus life is also a transformation of the traditional citizen's life. There is a fish tank in the middle of the yard of the uncle's family, which swims several goldfish, which is the love of Beijing people to spend their days. There are two jujube trees in the courtyard; the dates of the knot are crispy Every fall, my brother and I looked forward to my uncle's family coming to send dates. I see the old she and Liang Shiqiu write old Beijing life, 'ceiling fish tank pomegranate tree, Mr. fat dog girl' or something, how much there is a little familiar and cordial feeling, just because of my three uncle's family. \\nIt is such a clean and neat small courtyard, I saw it quickly fall down into a few years as 'small miscellaneous yard'. After my uncle became the right, his identity as a landlord was no longer recognized. Housing management departments stuck into households after household, and built huts in the middle of the yard without enough room, and finally got nowhere to walk. It turns out that the backyard is a garden, some flowers and vegetables, read Lu Xun wrote 'Bai jingyangcao Garden', I think of the uncle's garden. Later, the garden was also dense and built a small room and moved into people. \\nThe decline of the uncle's family small courtyard has become the epitome of his living conditions. After the Cultural Revolution, the\\n situation of my two Bober greatly improved, but my uncle's family is still a scene of impoverishment. It seems that the right is also doing the 'bigger', the\\n better, if it is an unknown pawn, once he is knocked down, do not want to really turn over for life. Because of family politics, none of his\\n uncle's three grandchildren are well educated, and I think this is his deepest pain. \\nOur generation and previous generation are really diaphragm. Emotionally, mentally, to academic, are separated by a\\n thick layer. I respect my uncles and my brothers, but I don't know their inner world, and it's not clear\\n what spiritual resources were holding them through that unspeakable and difficult time. My uncle later went on four walls, and the\\n house was moved more simple, from the original 'middle-aged' to 'urban poor', and the property that originally belonged to him never returned to his name. But he was really poor. Also walking, he went out early every morning to drink a bowl of soy milk, eat a oil cake, walk around the way, measure the world around. Every time I went to see him, he was delighted with the early morning trip. That generation was gone. \\nPAGE 3"}

            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "[Attached] General Assembly of the Communist Party of China Writers Association: 'Resolution on Expulsion of Bai Lang Party' (January 14, 1958)\\nBai Lang, formerly known as Liu Li, female, Liaoning Shenyang, now 45 years old, family origin old officials, my writer. 1941 to Yan'an, joined the Communist Party of China in 1945. He has served as director of Yan'an Wenkang, Deputy Minister of Journal of Northeast China Daily, Executive Board of the Northeast Women's Federation, Director of China Writers Association, and now professional writer. \\nSince his participation in the revolution, Bai Lang has always adhered to the position of bourgeois individualism, and the long-standing relationship with the Party has been abnormal, so that it has developed to form an anti-party group with Ding Ling and Luo Feng and other anti-party groups to carry out anti-party activities. In this anti-right struggle, the cooperative party group held 27 expanded meetings to fight Ding Chen's opposition group. According to the information that revealed and investigated the truth, the main opposition facts of Bai Lang are as follows:\\nFirst, when the revolution in Yan'an was difficult in 1942, Bai Lang and Luo Feng, Xiao Jun and Ai Qing jointly published an anti-party article 'Black Dots in the Sun', calling for writing works that exposed the dark side of Yan'an, defaming the party and the revolution. \\nSecond, after the national liberation, Bai Lang, because of the work assigned by the Party and written out some works, she did not see this as the result of the Party's training. Instead, she took pride in complacency and resisted criticism from the Party and comrades. In 1953, she and Luo Feng and others took the Northeast Bureau to summarize four years of literature and art work in the Northeast region, engaged in unorganized activities, inciting the masses and attacking the party. and to carry out a vicious attack on comrades who lead the Northeastern literary work. When their wrong words and deeds were opposed, Bellang still insisted on the anti-party stance, and said excitedly and generously: 'I do not shake, do not yield, do not surrender!' In 1955, the organization of the cooperative party held a branch expansion meeting to criticize and educate Bai lang's anti-party words and deeds on the basis of the complaints from the Northeast against Bai lang and Luo Feng, and the material revealed at the time the party's party's struggle against the Ding Chen opposition group. Not only did White Lang not very well check himself and receive lessons. Instead, hatred against the party is in the heart. The party's criticism of stigmatizing her is 'blow', 'insults,' and 'false.' \\nThird, as early as 1956, Bai lang and Luo Feng further collaborated with Ding and Chen opposition leaders Ding Ling; participated in the activities of Ding Chen's anti-party group, complicity with Ding Ling and Luo Feng to overthrow the conclusions of the 1955 cooperative party group on Ding and Chen's opposition group and criticism of Bai Lang by the party organization. Belong's slander and comrades criticized her as 'unclear or wrong', 'nothing to do', 'harm fraudulent madness', is 'suppressing democracy', is 'implicit in some untold motive and purpose'; Bai Lang willingly willingly run around for Ding Ling's case, when Luo Feng took the party in his capacity as a branch secretary After the Committee dealt with the Ding and Chen issues, Bai Lang immediately briefed Ding Ling with a letter, which greatly fueled Ding Ling's anti-party vigor. Ding Ling wants to 'all through the earth', Bai Lang spread rumors, saying that the struggle has been good, and the literary world thus 'looks away from God'; and made a distortion of facts and reversed black and white statements in front of a Comrade of the Central Committee, defending Ding Ling's anti-party crimes in order to achieve their so-called 'Tongtian' purpose. After the Bo-Hungary incident, Bai lang's anti-party flames were even higher. At the meeting convened by the cooperative party group and the general branch this spring, Bai lang, after conspiracy beforehand and Ding Ling, even even her speech at the meeting was read to Ding Ling beforehand. Ding Ling said: 'The attack targets are less concentrated', so Bai lang's attitude is more brutal Unreasonable, menacing, at the party meeting, arrogant cries 'I will go out!' At the meeting of the party said: 'I also went with Ding Ling when she was unlucky!' And abusive as the party group, the total branch criticized them as 'short selling short'. Concentrate all vicious words to insult the party. \\nThe above facts show that Bai Lang is a member of the Ding Chen Group. Since she joined the party, she has always been proud of complacency and refuses to criticize her extremely serious individualist ideas, although she has repeatedly been educated by the party, because she has not been completely reformed because she has taken an unhonest attitude towards the party. In her relationship with Luo Feng, when the organization has had solid information to prove that Luo Feng has reversed in history, Bai lang not only did not stand on the party's position to provide relevant materials faithfully to the party, but instead defended Luo Feng's deceiving party behavior, and wrote the material that she dared to assure the party that Luo Feng was in the law of the enemy There were no confessions and yields in court. Bellang has not stood the test at several important junctures, especially when the bourgeois right-wing rampant attack on the party, she actively participated in the Ding Chen anti-party group's offensive against the party, thus completely losing the minimum conditions for a party member and falling into a bourgeois right. According to the Third Plenary Session of the Third Plenary Session on Handling Rightists in the Party, according to Brang's anti-party crimes and her review, for the sake of serious Party discipline and safeguarding the unity and unity of the Party, all the members of the CPC China Writers' Association General Assembly unanimously approved by 89 votes, expelling Bai lang's party membership. It also recommended that the People's Deputies to the National People's Congress be abolished, the NUAC members should be abolished and their literary (formerly literary level), level be abolished.

He slandered the party 'to swallow the fruits of the people's victory and climb to the people's head'; said 'it is unconditional promotion to party members, and not to promote non-party cadres'; he cursed a group of Party member pilots trained by the Old Aviation School 'neither respects teachers nor does it matter' and 'lacks humanity.' \\nThe right-wing elements have negated the major construction achievements of the air force over the years from scratch, from small to large, weak to strong. 'For more than seven years, the quality of flight training has not improved, first class accidents are serious', he said. He said this is 'such an adversary miracle made under the sectarianism monopoly of the Communist Party of China,' because 'the use of cadres did not do their best, do their best, do their best, and do their best, but rather a lot of maneuvers.' He said that many of the comrades in charge of the air force 'are not competent' and should 'withdraw all those talents'. He proclaimed that, like him, 'the true talent for building the air force,' 'non-party Bolsheviks,' 'loving the motherland like his own mother,' 'the founder of the People's Air Force', 'talented,' and the dozens of so-called 'experts' he has recommended are the most competent candidates. \\nThese reactionary remarks were strongly refuted by comrades Lv Liping, Liu Shanben, Zhang Kongxiu and Xing Haifan. They expose a consistent anti-socialist anti-socialist rhetoric and deeds. Comrade Zhang Kongxiu queried: 'The group of Party member pilots who graduated from the old aviation school have mastered modern aviation technology. In the great war against the US-DPRK and defending the airspace of the motherland, many comrades such as Li Han, Zhang Jihui, Wang Hai, Gao Yueming and Lu Min followed one by one to become the People's British Comrades Xiong, Mu Dunkang, Chen Liang and other comrades sacrificed glory for the motherland in the air battle. Many comrades including Fang Ziyi, An Zhimin Has become the backbone of building the People's Air Force. Is this their 'lack of humanity'?' \\nZhang Kongxiu, in his speech, refuted the self-proclaimed 'ability to build the air force' with facts. He said, not even the simple turning radius, the formula for the front angle can not be written down, even a variety of clouds can not be recognized, 'flight order' he does not know, even some emotional knowledge of flying at high altitude is not, but boasting himself much more beautiful than Phoenix. Who is recommended by white? Zhang Kongxiu said: 'Most of these people are politically unreliable, or have categorically refused to work for our army during difficult times. As far as Wu Dingchen, he was an activist who fought the civil war with KMT aircraft during the liberation war. He was shot down and captured by our army in 1948. After education, he also categorically refused to work in the liberated areas, and was sent out of the country by our army in a spirit of generosity. He was maimed only because of injuries and injuries and no longer retained him by the KMT. In May 1949, when our army triumphed south, he reported back to our army in Hankou, and later assigned him to Hengyang on standby. Who knows he actually deceived his travel expenses to speculative trading. Can an 'expert' like this build the People's Air Force?' \\nmisappropriation, parting cadres, maliciously inciting\\nZhang Kongxiu also uncovered the tactics of falsely manipulation of relations between officials and dissociating party groups. Zhang Kongxiu said: I spent two years at an aviation school and heard him spreading rumors and slandering a marshal and deputy commander of the air force king. He also provoked and pulled the cadres. At one time, several heads of the aviation school (including blatant), studied the issue of cadre promotion in one piece. After the meeting, after the meeting, I asked a cadre who had decided to promote, and shamelessly said to the cadre: 'I have decided to report to promote you, and the order will be made public.' The cadre reported his behavior to the Party Committee. The Party Committee had made individual criticism of the confession, and he felt hated in his heart. A few months later, on the pretext that the cadre did not respect him and hit the cadre. Zhang Kongxiu also revealed: once again, I met with nothing at the Air Force guest house and said, 'I told Wu's Political Committee of Lai Dayuan (a aviation school committee), please do not misunderstand, I am very good to you.' It means I work with him to exclude Comrade Lai Dayuan. \\nThis right-wing, who has always provoked separation, also carried out insidious and vicious incitement against insurgents and former KMT Air Force personnel who remained on the mainland at a colloquium held by the Air Force Party Committee for the intifada and reporting personnel. \\nExcuses 'review' to continue to cast cold arrows to the party\\nWhen comrades seriously criticized his anti-socialist rhetoric and deeds against the party, he wrote a 'complaint letter' to the Air Force Chief, defaming the guest house 'organized a retaliation team' specifically to 'retaliate against him.' \\nIn more than half a month of debate, six 'reviews' were conducted in total. In his so-called 'review', this old and frightist man continues to brag for himself, playing as an 'old qualified red element' while continuing to cast cold arrows to the party. He insidiously said: 'People are courteous exchanges, especially for the Long March senior cadres, and should not criticize them unrelentlessly. All the cadres who returned from Xinjiang began to respect me, because I criticized someone with no hesitation, and their view of me completely changed.' Implied that he was honest, old cadres retaliated against him, and party members treated him with sectarianism. 'In my speech on May 30, I should say more about the achievements of the air force development where the Party's policies and guidelines are good, and I have made a subjective and one-sided distortion of this fallacy, and I have lost the prestige of the chief.' Hint because he exposes the shortcomings of the leadership, leading on the whole him. \\nWhite is a traitor Wang Jingwei's 'red man'\\nComrades at the meeting expressed outrage at this very unhonest attitude. Many comrades who learned about him, debunked the so-called 'old qualified red elements' on the spot, originally a traitor Wang Jingwei's 'red man'. \\nBorn from a wealthy farmer family, took part in the air force of warlord Zhang Zuolin at the age of 17 and went to France to study two years of flight technology. After returning to the country, he became a Major's Air Force Officer, and then promoted to Lieutenant After the incident, he betrayed Zhang Xueliang because of his dissatisfaction with his status, relying on Liu Xiang, the Sichuan warlord Liu Xiang, and became the Colonel of the Aviation Administration of Liu Xiang. Bai qi confessed that while the Red Four Army Long March Road passed through Sichuan, he had personally bombed the Red Army on a plane. After Liu Xiang was defeated by Chiang Kai-shek, he was squeezed to an airport in Yunnan as an air station webmaster. At that time, he received a grant of about 100,000 yuan (fiat currency), and made a big bet. After losing the money, he fled to Guangzhou, participated in the traitor Wang Jingwei's 'peace transport', and made 'anti-Republican salvation' traitor remarks. Day, Wang very appreciate it, with a special plane to receive him to Nanjing. Due to his faithful service to the Japanese imperialism, he soon became the Major General in charge of Wang pseudo-air force special aircraft. In the summer of 1945, on the eve of the surrender of the day Kou, he received the appointment of the advance members of the Kuomintang. However, for fear of tracing the charges of abduction and absconding after the incident, he went to the new four armed forces only when there was no way to go. \\nIn the spirit of leniency in the past, my party has given him a generous treatment in order to strive for, educate and transform him. In a difficult war environment, he organized the safe transportation of his family to the Northeast, and allowed him to serve as deputy chief of the aviation brigade, vice-president of aviation school, deputy director of aviation department, director of the military academy air force professors and other important positions. But how did he repay the people? It was reported that a series of factional activities were carried out in white, actively pulling together a group of people coming from Wang Jingwei, planning for them everywhere and placing their place. The aim is to attempt to form a factional organization under his leadership in order to stand up with the party chambers. According to his own accounts, he sponsored some people, not really caring for them and building the air force, but in order to use them to improve their status.

In 1916, Li Dazhao wrote this couplets to his friends, which later saw as a portrayal of Li Dazhao's life spirit. On April 28, 1927, Li Dazhao was killed in Beijing by Zhang Zuolin. Just that year, Bai shi was born in Zhoujiaying Village, Jianggezhuang Town, Leting County, more than 10 km from Li Dazhao's hometown. His father named him Zhou Deheng, later pseudonym Bai shi, and after years Bai shi grew up as a senior leadership cadre of the Communist Party of China (Secretary of Hebei Provincial Commission for Disciplinary Commission). Bai shi has adhering to the revolutionary spirit and bone of his predecessor Li Dazhao. After half his life misery does not change faith and loyalty. In his old age, the creation of a long novel 'from prisoner to secretary of the provincial committee' attracted extensive attention. 'Moral' and 'article' complement each other, showing the spirit of a Communist Party member's persistent pursuit of truth. [Editor's Note: Zhang Zuolin's Compilation of Documents of the Soviet Conspiracy is fully proof that Lee Da-zhao is a Russian-Russian leader, a leader of the Kuomintang and Communist Party in carrying out activities to subvert the government.] \\nBig ups and downs, the legendary life of \\nwhite stone since childhood, 12 years old away from home, alone to Luanxian provincial teacher with elementary school to read high school, after primary school and go to Baoding junior high school. Due to his outstanding achievements, he jumped in secondary school, admitted to Baoding Provincial Teachers College. At that time, during the war of resistance, the young Shiraishi witnessed the brutality of the Japanese aggressors and corruption of the KMT government. During school, he actively participated in the underground organization of the Communist Party of China and did a lot of work for the local anti-Japanese rescue campaign. After Japan surrendered, Shiraishi was arrested and imprisoned by the Kuomintang. After a few turns, he went to Zhangjiakou, the liberated area of Jincha-ji, to continue studying in the Literature Department of the North China United Nations General Assembly College of Literature and Arts. After graduation, he stayed for graduate students. After the 'liberation' of Baoding, Bai shi was transferred to Baoding as Youth League work. During the course, he published more than 100 articles such as poetry, prose, literary theories, and had a love with the talented newspaper editor Feng Yiping at first sight. At a time when couples were passionate about a better future, waves of political movements followed by waves of political movements, their destiny changed dramatically. \\nIn 1957, Shiraishi was beaten as the right with unwarranted charges. He never admits any 'crime' and was designated as 'extreme right' from severe punishment-dismissal of party nationality, public office, re-education through labor, Feng Yiping was also sent to the farm supervision and reform. In the labor farm, Shiraishi still refused to 'confess guilt', was reformed for 12 years, and then escorted to the countryside for 10 years of 'mass dictatorship'. Feng Yiping had a slightly better situation. After 'hat-picking' was assigned to the County Agriculture Bureau, but she was originally the editor of the provincial newspaper for 10 years, but only took the salaries of the handyman who had just taken part in the job and was discriminated against. The most distressing thing is that their only son, Big Lock, was 12 years old because of the death of their parents. \\nDuring those bleak years, Bai shi and Feng Yiping suffered, but always held their trust in the party, firmly believed that one day they would make a cloud to see the day, but also their innocence. Based on such a firm belief, the couple are mixed with each other, supporting each other through the difficult process of wind and rain. \\nAfter the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Party Central Committee, the White Stone couple finally got 'praised', at that time Shiraishi was 52 years old. He could have gone to work in some wealthy and entitled units, but resolutely chose Qingshui Yamen, the newly established Shijiazhuang Agricultural Modernization Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences at that time. Because of years of rural life, he deeply understands the poverty and hardship of farmers, worried about the future of the countryside and the fate of the farmers. At that time, the idea of the 'left' was still deeply entrenched in the minds of some people. The regime and regulations of the People's Commune were still not touchable, and even some of them were still studying 'poor transition' and 'leapfrogging'. Instead of taking part in the 'research' that catered to the political glimpse, Bai shi went to Shanghai, Jiangsu and other rural areas where life was better to gather materials and propose their own topics. Soon, one of his papers crashed at the National Symposium on Rural Economics. This paper put forward the views of rural areas to take the road of comprehensive agricultural, industrial and commercial management, abolish the people's communes into a township, and to allow farmers to work in business and business enterprises. This doesn't seem new at this time, but in an era when even old lady wearing a basket of eggs was taking the path of capitalism, it was a thunder. For a time, the voice of praise came. Some people affirm that the paper is justified and clearly bold; others believe that such remarks reflect on the Provincial Committee, the Anti-Chinese Academy of Sciences, and even some people make small reports to the relevant departments and try to prevent the publication of the paper. Among the many 'voices', Shiraishi still insists on its own 'one stick', preferring to pay a greater price, but also to seek realistic ways out of the countryside. After all, the times are different. The country is moving forward and developing. The research topics of Bai shi quickly received the attention of the State Agriculture Committee and the Ministry of Agriculture and were listed as a research subject funded by the State Agricultural Commission. Shiraishi from 'old earth turtle, old society staff' into 'Golden Phoenix', his brave and firm belief and pragmatic style won people sincere admiration and respect. \\nIn 1982, the institutional reform of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Bai shi was recommended as party secretary of the Shijiazhuang Agricultural Modernization Research Institute. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has approved, and only until the Hebei Provincial Committee agrees to take office immediately. However, after a long time, the Hebei Provincial Committee did not echo, the old leadership of the Institute was very anxious, and several runs of the Provincial Committee Organization Department to say no results. On the first day of 1983, it was unsurprising that he was informed to the provincial committee to talk to the provincial committee, immediately adjourned the work of the provincial committee, served as a standing member of the Hebei Provincial Committee and entered the provincial committee leadership team. Later, people learned that the Provincial Committee made this decision, in addition to the outstanding performance of the work of White Stone, but also because he was just not, and firmly believed, in the past movements, despite having suffered a few hardships but insisted on the truth, not saying false words, reflecting the noble character of the outstanding Communist Party members. No one thought that Shiraishi, the 'old right', who suffered 22 years of humiliation, was 'old society member' after many years of re-education and rural labor, re-worked for less than four years, and he was legendary jumping four levels, and became a provincial leader. Later, he was elected as Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Commission for Discipline and Central Commission for Discipline Commission. \\n'The sword edge from the sharpened, plum fragrance from the bitter cold.' Difficulties and setbacks can cause undetermined people to sink or even lose their hopes for survival, but no matter what kind of dilemma, White Rock does not give up, but to exercise their strong will. He always adheres to the character of a Communist Party member and always remains loyal to the party. He told reporters who came to the interview: 'I should be grateful to the party, thank the reform and opening-up, let me finally wait until the day to solve the problem.' \\nTen years of hard work and disgusting the creation of\\n Shiraishi has always had a strong literary complex. After he went to the labor farm, he still wrote more than 300,000 words of novel reflecting the underground work of the Party. and a long novel piece of hundreds of thousands of words written on a notebook that reflects the peasant riots in Jidong. Unfortunately, these words were all destroyed at the time of the 'Cultural Revolution' inventory. After returning to work, he insisted on 'miscellaneous journals' and 'occasional memories', and he never stopped in leadership positions. Among them, 'miscellaneous' is at any time to record the senses of life and reading comments, so far there have been more than 40 books about 2 million words; 'Occasionally' is an accidental thought of writing material, has accumulated more than 30 million words so far. Many times, his writing volume reached 3,4,000 words a day, which in general is difficult to insist on doing. \\nBai shi was 66 years old when he retreated from the leadership of the Hebei Provincial People's Congress. He could have nourished the days, enjoy a relaxed and peaceful life in old age, but there is a thought always lingering in his mind, and after his leave is more and more intense, that is to record the hard years, let the novel become a mirror that reflects that history. Although revisiting that memory often brings pain, Shiraishi firmly believes that confronting a grim history, bleak life, will eventually promote people's wake, push ahead and inspire the passion for reform and innovation. With this idea, in April 1995, Shiraishi began the first part of a handwritten novel. \\nBecause it is not a professional writer, Shiraishi is not structured in advance, but according to the trajectory of life prototype, and the natural development of characters and plot, the writing process is complete with a deep life experience. In November 1996, the first draft of the first novel was completed. Subsequently, two drafts were completed at the end of 2001, following seven comprehensive revisions and repeated print proofreading. In the writing and modification process, a lot of characters, plot hard to write out, considering the reality, artistic processing and other factors, have to endure love, so we see this novel although only 600,000 words, but the first draft is not less than 1.2 million words. More than a million words, all by hand written by him and his old companion, during which hard, imaginable. In May 2005, the book after a few weeks, finally pay the Ziji, from the start of the creation of a full 10 years. Shiroishi was nearly 80 years old. \\nThe first book of the novel 'Forbidden Land' writes the miserable lives of the rightists during labor, and the second 'Deserted Village' writes a difficult humiliating life when the owner just returned to the countryside. The first print of the novel 12,000 copies, soon out of stock, 5 consecutive printing, also sold out. The novel has been well received by people. Zhang Qiei, Honorary Vice Chairman of China Cooperative Association, former vice chairman and secretary of the Secretariat of the China Cooperation Association, made the order of the book. Luo Yijun, former secretary of the secretariat of the China Filmmakers Association and President of the Chinese Film Critics Society, Xu Guangyao, honorary chairman of the Writers Association of Hebei Province, literary critic and former deputy editor of People's Literature, wrote a statement on the back cover of the book, saying it is a shocking chapter and thought-provoking historical painting Volumes. This is also a long story with a documentary color, if not experienced in person, by imagination, can't write such a unique realistic, shocking. In documentary techniques, the author sketched out a corner of real life in the era of great turmoil and concussion, and recorded the history of the soul of a nation with artistic image. It is a document of valuable value and far-reaching significance and a strong testimony to a painful history. \\nIn 2007, the third part of 'From Prisoners to Provincial Committee Secretary', 'After taking office' was also published by the author publishing house, which immediately attracted widespread attention. Compared to the first two, the skeleton after taking office is fictional, but the general context is still in the context of his own personal experience. The protagonist of the novel went up to four levels from a prisoner for many years, one step into the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee, informing him to enter into the dialogue between the provincial committee and the secretary of the provincial committee. Several times he entered the compound of the Provincial Committee and was not available, and the dramatic dialogue of the staff of the conveying room was also generally real. A literary critic writes: a series of intricate conflicts, overflowing suspicions and waves. In the stressful, breathable plot, reading is not cheap happiness, but gives people many aspects of thinking and warning. Well-known commentator Fan Yonggo commented: 'After taking office' differs from some of the works on the same subject in that it is written in the life of the author, not just in the study. I felt the tremor of the mind after reading.' \\nShiraishi wrote in 'Postscript': 'Reflects the truth according to the original face of life, especially in an era that leads astray, shady and ugliness will inevitably be inevitable. Such a truth can sometimes be deplorable, painful and even temporary frustration. But facing a grim history, bleak life, will eventually promote people awakening, push forward, inspire the passion for reform and innovation.' History, should not be forgotten. Novel, an artistic image that documents the history of the soul of a nation. The creation of this novel is closely linked to the legendary life experience of the author Shiraishi and Feng Yiping couple. \\nBai shi is now a member of China Writers Association and is one of five writers in Hebei province who have contributed to the new Chinese literary career and the 60th anniversary of literary creation. \\nOld as Yizhuang, afterheat\\n white stone love calligraphy art, but has not had the opportunity and time to practice. After his leave, he gained more time and he began to practice calligraphy. In the course of his calligraphy art creation, he draws on the essence of his predecessors and constantly innovates to form his own unique style. He is compatible and does not oppose any genre, including some of the ugly beautiful factions. 'The art of calligraphy cannot be cluttered to the original rules. To innovate, without innovation will not have its own style, it will not succeed, at best a scripter.' Shiraishi's innovation is not a abandonment of tradition, but an innovation based on tradition. He has worked hard on Kai, line, Lian, seal, especially in books and books deep, his line books have the bone of the line, and the style of chainbook, seems to be a unique one. During the interview, he showed the author a piece of his calligraphy, 'Something is human, not to bear people.' The same word 'person' is completely different. 'Man' word 'man', lively and flexible, full of spirit show and full of motion, giving people a kind of elegant and dashing feeling; and 'people' word, one glance, full of stable atmosphere. Shiraishi explained that 'things are man-made' emphasize that a person must have flexibility when doing things, can not be stupid, to have innovation; 'God does not bear people' should show strong indomination, speak principles, observe the rules, adhere to the bottom line of being human. \\nA point of work will have a harvest, a payout has a return. After years of practice and innovation, Shiraishi's calligraphy works have been widely recognized by society. His works won the 'Special Honorary Award' at the first national exhibition of old age paintings and calligraphers, with only three people in the province. Awarded in numerous national exhibitions such as 'International Exhibition of Calligraphy and Calligraphy Works' approved by the Ministry of Culture. More than 100 works have been published in calligraphy and calligraphy publications and general newspapers, and the works are collected from over 100 large collections of calligraphy and calligraphy throughout the country and province. \\nWhite stone not only in the art of painting and painting, he also served as president of the Hebei Provincial Institute of Elderly Calligraphy and Calligraphy, contributing a lot to the cause of elderly calligraphy throughout the province. Elderly calligraphy and calligraphy in Hebei province was established on June 26, 1987, from its establishment to 1999 12 years, although there has also been some development, but has little impact. One is that there are fewer members, only more than 2,000 people. Second, there was little activity. Shiraishi had not heard of the organization before he became president, and the city's chapters had no influence on the local side. Third is in a non-establishment, no funds, no space 'three nil' state. \\nWhat to do is the best Bai shi as president quickly enter the working state, after a lot of research, he has created three points of experience in the development of elderly calligraphy in Hebei province, that is, later molding 'three old experience'. The 'first old' in the 'three old experience' is the old cadre bureau. That is, the study of seniors and calligraphy in provinces and municipalities is attached to the old cadre bureau, thus solving the problem of event venues and personnel. The daily work, meetings, and exhibitions of the Hebei Provincial Institute on the Elderly are at the Elderly Activity Center of the Old Cadre Bureau. The deputy director of the Activity Center serves as the executive deputy secretary of the calligraphy and calligraphy association, and the head of the office of the old cadres activity center also serves as the office director of the Institute for the Elderly Calligraphy and Calligraphy Institute. The problems of office space and staff have been solved, and this approach has been largely adopted by the Municipal Institute of Calligraphy and Calligraphy. The 'second old' is the old cadre. That is, the old leaders who have returned to serve as the president of the local research society. In order to invite some old leaders to serve as president, Shiraishi paid a lot of effort, some old leaders also have many difficulties themselves, Shiraishi repeatedly found, finally made the cities do this. The original president of Handan city is a retired teacher, with mentoring relations as a link to maintain the operation of the study, because of its limited influence, in the city leaders there is no attention. Many difficulties cannot be solved, and activities can only be limited to a small circle of 1,200 people. Later by a former secretary of the Municipal Commission for Disciplinary Affairs and deputy director of the People's Congress as chairman, immediately opened the situation, the organization developed rapidly and popularized the counties, and members quickly grew to nearly 2,000 people. It has been repeatedly demonstrated everywhere that holding older leaders as presidents is an important experience. For the old leaders who hold the position of president do not require a high level of art of painting and painting, as long as you like painting, prestige, dedication, can promote the development of the cause. The 'third old' is the old backbone, which is to absorb a group of prestigious and advanced painters to serve as the backbone of the calligraphy and calligraphy seminar. This will greatly enhance the appeal and influence of the calligraphy and calligraphy study, and also greatly contribute to the development of the calligraphy and calligraphy study. \\nAfter the promotion of the 'three old experience', the research society of elderly calligraphy and calligraphy in Hebei province has been rapidly developed. To date, the membership has grown to 25,000 people. In terms of organizational development, since the main activity was at the municipal level, the Research Council has now spread to the county, and has vigorously developed to the grassroots level. Many townships, towns, universities, and large enterprises have had old calligraphy and calligraphy seminars, and insisted on perennial activities, and a thriving scene emerged. Particularly valuable is that under the leadership of Shiraishi, the influence of the Institute for Seniors and Calligraphy is becoming more and more influential. Every time the Institute of Calligraphy and Calligraphy held activities, leaders at all levels actively participated, and in the annual meeting, the relevant provincial leaders came to participate. The Institute of Calligraphy and Calligraphy on the Elderly in Hebei Province also has a system, that is, each city alternately hosts exhibitions of works throughout the province. Whenever an exhibition is held, the leaders of the four local teams, the organization department, the propaganda department, and the old cadre bureau all participate actively, making the impact of the Institute of Calligraphy and Calligraphy greatly improved. What is more welcome is the fact that old age paintings and calligraphy have begun to enter the cultural market, giving wider social recognition to the fruits of their hobbies. \\nFor more than a dozen years, Bai shi has edited five large sets of large hardcover paintings and calligraphy works-'Yan Zhao Han ink-outstanding collection of old calligraphy in Hebei province', opened up a new world for the cause of elderly calligraphy and calligraphy in Hebei province. At present, the Institute of Elderly Calligraphy and Calligraphy of Hebei Province has a great influence not only in Hebei province, but also in other provinces and cities. \\nShiraishi's legendary life experience is reflected from a side of the history of our country's decades of twists and turns, in Shiraishi's own words: 'Rich experience, whether it is brilliant or tribulation, is a person's precious spiritual wealth.' From the perseverance and tenacity of Shiraishi, we have once again seen the collective character of our nation. (2013.12.11)\\n (Written by Kong Lingchun)\\nPAGE 1"}

Soon, however, their conspiracy was known to the general public. \\nThe whole wind movement has just begun, with vicious slander against the party at the social symposium. 'The press's party organization is very cold and bureaucratic, which is inseparable from the bureaucratic leadership of the higher party committee,' he said. Bai shou hands believe that 'the party educates sectarianism among activists', and even believes that 'the publishing house's party does not have any education for party members and only teaches party members to leave the masses.' And said, 'activists are some viino, every horse, say a little talk, respond to the worm.' It also wants to get rid of party and executive leadership. He called for an unrestricted expansion of editorial powers in the work of the editors, from the selection of questions to the publication of books to the sole discretion of the editor. \\nAt that time, a lot of anti-socialist newspapers appeared in the society, and were very interested in white hands. His pseudonym wrote an essay in the newspaper, saying that it was 'all known as the 'hero' of the party and the state.' \\nIn white hands, delusions incite comrades of the party to rise up to the Rebel Party, and also posted a slogan that wrote, 'Communist members! Lost the 'head to the whole' thought, please-stand up and speak freely!' Later, he also commanded other right-wing elements, asking the party whether it had any decision to restrict the party's members and directly threatened party members to 'attack' him if they did not mention their opinions again. \\nRight, Zhang Xueqin, colluded with white hands at the beginning of the whole wind movement. He said that party members and activists are personalities with no personality. He wrote a large print entitled 'Publishers Don't Cultivate Minions' (the big print he didn't dare to post it). He said he appreciated the 'Grasswood' of the Quicksand River. And said that Lin Xiling has 'talents', Zhang Bojun is a 'figure with political ideals', and that the fallacy of 'Party world' of Zhu Anping is 'justified'. He saw the review by right-wing elements in the newspaper, saying that these people were 'greedy and fearing death'; he saw the fallacy of Feng Yuan's sponsorship of Zhu Anping, saying that Fengyuan at the beginning was 'real brave'. He defended another right-wing member of the publishing house's 'anti-harm and less' theory. When all kinds of absurd statements were refuted in the press, he and white hands and other people's congresses exclaimed that it was 'hampering the bloom, and the whole wind movement was moving in an unhealthy direction.' They abused their comrades who gave a fair opinion as 'sage' who had 'insincerity, inferior' and openly proposed to lead the rule and give a just opinion. \\nNow, the right-wing elements and Zhang Xueqin have been ugly exposed by employees of the Anhui People's Publishing House. Employees of the whole community are vigorous and are pursuing them. (People's Daily 1957.8.4)"}

But speaking of Zunyi conference site, no one in the world knows. On January 15, 1935, the Party Central Committee held a meeting on the expansion of the Politburo in this small building, which has since become the turning point of the Chinese revolution, which is the private residence of Bai Huizhang, the former National Revolutionary Army's 102nd division. \\nBefore telling the story of Bai Hui chapter, first look at a woman's report:\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, in Guizhou Qianbei Meitan County, a village road, once beating the figure of a woman Juan Xiu. Wearing a white shirt and blue pants, she pulled two young children in her hands, while walking and singing Chairman Mao's quote: 'Policy and strategy are party life, leaders at all levels must pay full attention...' The lyrics are a little joyful, blue pants and white shirts are like clouds in the sky, the crisp song spread across Every corner of the village and even the county city...\\nIt was an unprecedented period of time, black and white confusion, demons reversed, many people were indefensible, angry and committed suicide. However, the woman chose to sing songs and face it with a smile, so that those in power had to abandon her reformation. The adults and children in the village knew the woman, and saw her walk, respectfully shouting a teacher, he hurried to the side. \\nThe village population of the village teacher is full name Bai Yi Fang, is a teacher of the school in Meitan County. Almost none of the people born in the 1960s of the last century did not know her, and many were her students. She is a teaching skill, and every school in small towns and towns has left behind her to explore with her teachers. \\nThis year is 88 years old old \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), Ms. Boyi Fang... That village road singing like Van Yin, passing through the village, through the heavy dust rang up, singing as quiet, with sunshine, light wind and water greetings, so that people can't help but tears. And as a whisk, the heart is the day of May, a clear and quiet.' (14)\\nWho is this woman? \\nShe is the niece of the anti-Japanese veteran Pak Hui, daughter of the anti-Japanese martyr Bai Charter. \\nBai Charter also, the station director of the 102 Division of the National Revolutionary Army Lieutenant Colonel, in May 1938 to participate in the battle of Dangshan in Xuzhou, unfortunately was bombed by enemy aircraft, killed the sand field, sacrificed for the country, was 35 years old, so far unknown where the remains are.

Later, the rainy day was also a nine-dead life of Purgatory Yuanbau, to see if his number could survive 24 years, ushered in another era that should be counted in Chinese history-1976 after Mao Zedong's death. \\nThrough 1976, Zunyi veteran of Zunyi nationality in the same time as Bai Huizhang (Huangpu I graduated, 14th army chief of the National Revolutionary Army, deputy commander in Northeast China, and last deputy governor of Guizhou Province, died in 1982), Wang Guangwei (Huangpu seven graduated, once served as National Revolutionary Army 103 division commander, Yunnan Songshan war Distinguished service merit, won the highest level of anti-war youth day medal One, died in Guiyang in 2004), Chen Yongsi (1907-1981), 103 deputy commander, 249 Division Major General, Central Military Academy higher education class third phase), and so on, finally ushered in life sangyu night scene, sunset lining red, good luck. But Wang Jialie, who died before 1976 (1893.5.27-1966.8, was the 25th army chief of the Kuomintang army, the Guizhou provincial government, the senate of the military senate of the Kuomintang government, deputy head of the 20th Legion Legion, and senior senator of the Chongqing Military Commission. After the victory of the resistance, idle Zunyi. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, former member of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, Vice Chairman of Guizhou Province CPPCC), Wu Jianmin (1895-1962, Guizhou Army lecture No. 1, Army University special class 4 graduated, deputy chief of the eighth army, member of the Guizhou Provincial People's Government and Deputy Office of Civil Affairs Department after liberation Long, beaten to the right, ended in 1962. (Although facing the political high pressure of the mountain and rain, the late scene was bleak and gloomy, it still fell well to preserve his body, there was no abject ending like the Bai Hui chapter, and so far the corpses do not know where they are.), \\nNow looking back at history, Bai Hui chapter one has a lot of life, this doom seems to have started from the New Year in 1935. \\nJust after New Year's Day, the Red Army of the Central China Army entered Guizhou, and another Central Army came along. The two Central Plains Central Army, one militarily weakened the local warlords in Guizhou, and the other resolved the long-term secession political pattern politically, causing the Qianan army to fall apart, and the two divisions were broken down, and the two divisions were disintegrated and transferred out. Within Guizhou. From this moment on, Pak Huizhang's fate in the ensuing long 17 years of personal path, both in the KMT regime and the post-liberation experience, has been bumpy and shocking. \\nIn successive documents, you can analyze Wang Jialie's stepping down and the fate of Bai Hui chapter later is inextricably linked. \\nIn the early 1930s of the last century, the southwest warlords nominally returned to Chiang Kai-shek's central government. In fact, it was only to pay to the central government, and the central decree was difficult to implement. In January 1935, the Central Red Army entered Guizhou. This gives Chiang Kai-shek a unique opportunity to destroy enemy warlords. Chiang Kai-shek sits in Guiyang, while adjusting troops to pursue the Red Army, while designing to force Wang Jialie to step down. Jiang Pai Yan Dao Gang to Qianxi, Dading, Fengguan Wish, heavy gold buy Wang Division Director He Zhizhong, Bai Hui Zhang. Promise to give him a weight of 50,000 yuan, upgrade the army chief, to Bai Hui Zhang 30,000 yuan. After the Guizhou army opened to Sichuan Shizhu, pay (Jiang finally failed to cash). After the Bai Hui zhang was bought, the head of the camp of the station, Linghu as a guest, brought two companies to the military department to raise wages to Wang Jialie, making Wang Jialie very embarrassed in the face of Ho Chengjun (Remarks 1), This episode. Although Pak Fai Zhang was forced by Chiang Kai-shek coercion, temporarily in exchange for self-protection, the future fate is still as unrooted artemisia, but from the view of the great history today, the Bai Hui Zhang, what is wrong with his superiors, but their behavior is in line with the great unity of the nation. The trend has contributed to the total elimination of local separatist forces by the central government. \\nBai Hui Zhang attached to the central government army, in the later war of resistance, led the 102 division, mainly composed of children in Guizhou, played countless hard battles in the war of resistance-August 1937, to participate in the 'eight one three' Songhu war; in November of the same year, participated in Nanjing defense war; in May 1938, in Dang Xuzhou War; 1939, participated in the war of Nanchang; later participated Four Changsha war, especially in September 1941, the second Changsha war was fierce. After the troops withdrew from their positions, they saw that more than 10,000 Guizhou generals left only a few hundred people in the district district, Bai Hui Zhang lost voice and cried. (Remarks 2)\\nSince the Qian army during the Anti-Japanese War, unlike the Sichuan Army and the Dianan Army Institute each have a complete local military system, Qianjun did not form an army according to the Chuan Army or the Dianan Army, or even to form a group army to use it. The Qianjun is simply a few 'independent' divisions that are subordinate to the Central Army, and its fate is only a few 'independent' divisions that are subordinate to the Central Army. Much different. It began to dial under Wei Lihuang, and then transferred to the eighth army command, and then transferred to the fourth army, always under the fence. \\n'We are a division alone fighting, guest everywhere, temporarily on the battlefield to find mother-in-law, to fight to only look forward, can not take care of, if any mistakes, the consequences are unpredictable.' The words said by the 102 division chief Bai Huizhang fully reflect the difficult situation in which the Qianjun was in during the anti-war period. Although the Qianan army struggled repeatedly during the war of resistance, it was always faced with the danger of annexation. And by the end of the anti-Japanese war, the Qianjun forces were indeed few remaining. \\nOfficers and soldiers generally believe that the 102 division has been divided and broken down. However, Master Bai Hui Zhang showed a rare view of the overall picture, and ordered the two regiments sent to Hu Zongnan First Army and Eighth Army to 'obey the command of the superior, if there is a shaken military code.' He thinks that maintaining the integrity of 102 divisions can only be said in terms of actual performance. This is really not the same in the context of the warlords who used the army as their own money and their respective battles. \\nIn May 1943, the fourth army chief Ouzhen raised the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the 27th Group, there was a vacancy in the position of the army chief. On qualifications and performance, it was supposed to be filled by deputy commander Bai Huizhang, but because Bai was a Guizhou, and the fourth army came from the Guangdong army, and Xue Yue's department, Zhang Deneng was promoted to the army chief (this person It is Zhang Fakui's nephew, and Zhang Fakui is Xue Yue's interrogation, so Zhang Deneng (Come to be army chief, Xue Yue is assured). In order to make it easier for Zhang Demeng to command several divisions, especially 102 divisions, he reassigned Bai Huizhang, deputy commander and 102 division commander of the fourth army, to the commander of the Gannan Division, and still holds the title of Deputy Chief of the 4th Army. In fact, Bai Hui Zhang wants to be a military chief is only his wish. Let's ask, will a guangdong predominantly army be taken over by a Guizhou man?. (Remarks 3)\\nThe fate and outcome of Qianjun and even Bai Hui Zhang himself can only be at mercy under the background of factions in the Kuomintang army and the great life of the mountains. \\nSima has always paid attention to the effects of personal character on fate, such as Li Guang, Li Si and other historical figures. If you analyze the personal character factors of Pak Hui chapter, is he deficient? Here is a piece of information that can be used as a reference: Bai Hui Zhang handout gas, hometown concept is strong. When he was reassigned as the commander of the Gannan Division District, his subordinates Li Shaobai, Gong Dejun, while playing Zhuang Ding was detected for private money, Jiang Jingguo must punish two people, and Bai Hui badge his hometown and secretly let away, Jiang Jingguo Not even the deputy commander. Soon, Bai Huizhang was transferred to the Jiangxi Military District as a party and lost its military power. (Remarks 4)\\nHe said that Bai Hui Zhang did not understand politics, did not know the political weight of the son of Chiang Kai-shek, and did not know the power of the nodes, and to build up some foundation for himself. In fact, after the victory of the resistance, Jiang Gongzi played tiger in Shanghai. Some people advised Bai Hui zhang to find a fat shortage of Xiaojiang Mi is not impossible, especially Xiao Jiang's heart, Wang Sheng, who followed Xiaojiang throughout his life, as the senior staff of Xiaojiang. Wang Sheng served as the head of the Gannan division under Bai Huizhang. The two people had private relations, and Wang Sheng came out to find Xiaojiang, Bai Hui Zhang Pingbu Qingyun is not impossible either. There is also a story decades later to prove that in 1982, when he was going abroad, Jiang Xiaofang, Bai Huizhang's grandson, just graduated from university (with his mother's name, his father, Bosli, Suzhou Dongwu University, Shanghai Law School, then transferred to Guizhou University, passed away from Guizhou University in 1996, Peng Chunrong, mother Peng Chunrong (Graduated from Zunyi Health School and died in 2009.), By Liu Tielun of the old department of Bai Huizhang (Guizhou Provincial Government Counsellor, that year was 102 division engineering staff officer, and also with the director Bai Huizhang was Zunyi, once participated in the negotiations of the National Communist Party of the North Ping Army Department in 1948), he wanted Jiang Xiang to release his country to South America Uruguay to find Wang Sheng, Wang was the ambassador of Taiwan at the time. Liu Tierun vows heisel claims that Wang Sheng will certainly accept you, the offspring of the Pok Hui chapter. Wang Sheng in 2005 on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the victory of the resistance, was invited to Beijing to attend commemorative activities, and he lost his hand with Bai Hui Zhang in the mainland.), \\nBefore speaking about Bai Hui chapter does not speak of principle selfish, but he also has no lack of hidden heart. In 1935, Bai Huizhang led the Qianjun to follow the Red Army into Zunyi, in the outskirts of Gaoqiao caught eight left the Red Army, all the way tied up to the entrance of the Bai Mansion (today's Zunyi meeting memorial hall gate), people surrounded by water leakage. Bai Hui Zhang came out of the gate, let it loose, and said loud, 'You are all from Jiangxi, have been cheated. I now give you two oceans to let you go home.' The eight Red Army escaped and followed the Red Army. It is said that the eight Red Army have survived a hundred battles and served as senior cadres of the Party, but so far they do not know that what they put on is the Bai Hui chapter. (Remarks 5)\\nSaid that Bai Hui Zhang is unfavorable, but there is also a story that shows that he is a man of integrity, evil like hatred, and strict requirements for army cadres. There was a former former Zunyi hometown who was the army quartermaster officer, and embezzlement of public funds was detected by him. The father of the lacquer and Bai Hui Zhang father, the old man of the old man, desperately in Zunyi Bojay Book a life-saving, Ran Bai Hui chapter is not moved, serious military discipline, public shooting, this matter has a great impact on the troops. (Remarks 6)\\nSome people also said that Jiang Jingguo later still valued the Bai Hui chapter, at the end of 1949, Jiang Jingguo suddenly called Guizhou President Gu Zhenglun to tell Bai Hui Zhang, saying that Mr. Jiang (Chiang Kai-shek), wanted him to fly Taiwan quickly... (Remark 7)\\nOn the morning of September 11, 2010, the author and Jiang Xiaofang spoke about this matter in a restaurant in Haikou. He said that Jiang Jingguo and his grandfather did not match the historical facts. In Gannan, Jiang Jingguo sent a car to pick up my grandfather and grandmother (Bai Hui Zhang Mrs. Wang Guangmin, Zun righteous people, 1962 in expensive State Dushan disease passed, his brother Wang Guanghan, was the third of the National Revolutionary Army (Chief of Staff of the Group, Chief of the Army is Thombo, died in 1995 in Hefei, Anhui Province.), To Jiang Jingguo's official residence, he set up a family feast for Bai Hui Zhang's mother mother and mother, which can be seen as not shallow between In this matter, Jiang Xiaofang's father, Bai Hui Zhang, the only son of Bai Si Li followed that year in Gannan's junior high school, and also had his \\nJiang Xiaofang said that the reason for the discord between Bai Huizhang and Jiang Jingguo at the beginning was because of the huge background of life experience of the two people. Jiang could not look at Guizhou's Turkish warlord, and Bai Huizhang, like most people in the Gannan government office at the time, 'accusing Xiaojiang of working style like the Communist Party.' (From Chen Danqing, 'Republic of Fan')\\nJiang Xiaofang also revealed a secret that has not been known to date. In fact, before Jiang Jingguo called 'fast fly Taiwan', the three people of the Bai Hui Zhang family once boarded a ship bound for Taiwan in Guangzhou. On the occasion of his imminent departure from the mainland, Bai Hui Zhang had sought the insight of his son Persiri, and finally the whole family was alone. To agree to abandon the ferry to Taiwan and detour back to Guizhou's hometown. \\nSome Zunyi people in that year were reluctant to go to Taiwan, one is Wu Jianping mentioned above. At the end of 1949, look at the point of the team in their hands, weigh the pros and cons, whether to resist or drift across the sea to Taiwan, finally, or choose to drop. Another is Zunyi Old Town, Cai Zhicheng, in the documentary writer Wang Vest's 'dandelion on the battlefield', was already KMT paratrooper Major Cai Zhicheng uprising in 1949, and later moved to Hong Kong, only separated from Taiwan, but still returned to Zunyi by Hanoi via Kunming. There is also a Zunyi man, the KMT Air Force, who obtained a historian similar to the Fifteenth Year of the Thousand Calendar, sent the opportunity to study in the United States. Wang once went to the United States twice to study abroad. Finally, on the eve of liberation, he retired from the Kuomintang army and returned to the town of Zunyi teacher, and later in Zunyi teacher college. Faculty teaching man, died in 1995. \\nIn fact, 1949 was a short and long year, this year behind the political and military history behind the background, there were sorrow clutches and flesh separated, there was a wandering at the crossroads of life. On the eve of this transformation, it is destined to carry out a reversal of differentiation and aggregation. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the fate of every Chinese inevitably coincided with cloudy politics. The history and strife of the two parties of the CPC ruthlessly affected everyone's choice, revealing how times test, merry, and influence the destiny of the individual. Chiang Kai-shek himself sent an orcicular plane to flew to Beiping at Beiping Nanyuan Airport at any time, and was 'rescued' can immediately board the plane south. (8), The rescued is the intellectuals of Beiping. The group of people, surrounded by the Liberation Army outside the city, in the city campus, generously denounced the corruption of the Kuomintang, was reluctant to board a plane and leave the ancient capital. \\nThe state of parents, can not be abandoned also. \\nBai Hui Zhang heard Gu Zhenglun's message at that time, there was a difficult face, immediately said, 'I only went to Taiwan alone, my grandfather's 80s, a big family in the house, taught me how to go?' (9)\\nSoon, Chen Cheng, a senior official of the ROC government, drove 600 kilometers from Chongqing and personally went to Zunyi Bai Huizhang Private Residence (today's Zunyi meeting site). The main guest drink similar, at this time, exclaimed a lot. Chen Cheng again raised the matter of flying Taiwan, Bai Huizhang said, 'Grandpa is sick and not at home (send Suiyang County to hide in the countryside), this family, you see how do I go?' It is the night guest who drank alcohol overnight, the day is not bright, so treasures each other. Chen Cheng drove away from dust and took the last plane from Guiyang to Taiwan. (10), since the end of all things! \\nWhy Chen Cheng to run far away from Zunyi to persuade the Bai Hui Zhang fly to Taiwan? In the KMT army, it is the newest one that focuses on contacts and relations with their neighbors and villages. Chen Cheng is a person of Zhejiang, while Bai Huizhang is a Guizhou inland province. The two have neither the same school experience nor the same family. This insider, it is also this time in Haikou to talk to Jiang Xiaofang, only to know the reason for that. \\nWuhan war in 1938, Bai Hui Zhang led 102 division to fight, the highest commander of the war zone is Chen Cheng. Because of the brave and tenacity of Guizhou officers and soldiers of the 102 division of Bai Hui chapter, brave and bravely kill enemies, make all allies on the battlefield look at, change the decadence of the 'double gunmen' that were badly chased by the Red Army in Guizhou Central. Chen Cheng see Bo Hui Zhang is a member with soldiers, want to pull together for their own cronies, by intentionally close to Bai Hui Zhang, 'in Wuhan base camp, personally pick up my grandparents to the house, by Mrs. Chen Cheng personally cooked', entertained very Yin. Jiang Xiaofang also said that Chen Chengli Lord Bai Huizhang was the fourth army chief and deputy commander of the Third Road Group. But Bai Hui Zhang considers that the Kuomintang army is factional and tipping each other, weighing the pros and cons repeatedly, and is not tolerated. \\nIn that year, Taiwan, by no means an island country that is rich in oil, has just recovered from Japan and Kou for more than half a century. It has been devastated, and the industry is completely isolated from the mainland. \\nIn 1949, the building will pour, the mountains and rivers upheaval, there are too many people like the Pak Hui chapter of the life of the Chinese people, too many people like the Bai Hui chapter. Immediately, the regime has changed, and he immediately fell into the underprivileged figure of society. \\nAfter the liberation of Zunyi, Bai Hui Zhang very pay attention to the inspection, reading books at home every day, never easy to see people to avoid. In the afternoon, Pak Hui Zhang sometimes smoked a cigarette, stop at the gate (the current memorial gate), for an hour and a half hours, convulsive... passing street neighbours is never easy to greet him. In the battle of Dangshan during the war of resistance, Bai Hui Zhang an ear was almost deaf by the day Kou artillery, once said to the family, 'At night I felt heard someone put a gun in the back garden...'\\nThis may be the true portrayal of the inner panic and unease. (11)\\nAfter the liberation of the spring, Bai Hui Zhang and his family in the garden after watching flying kite, saw a wall of neighbor (underground party), laughed: 'Brother, if you say earlier, I will look like this today oh.' Neighbors answered: 'Two brothers, how dare I for a while...' (12)\\nThis dialogue is really cloudy, life encounters and destiny as a wave of clouds, it is difficult to make clear in three words and two words. \\nThe crashing fall of the Kuomintang regime in the mainland is also the arrival of the Bai Hui chapter completely abandoned, and is the ultimate achievement of all his former body. \\nAbout the killing of Bai Hui Zhang, several articles published successively mention some of the reasons. \\nFirst of all, from October 1950 to the first half of 1953, the repression of the counter-revolutionary movement, which lasted more than two years, began. In the spirit of killing according to the targets of the CPC Central Committee: 'The CPC Guizhou Provincial Committee has asked to kill three thousandths, I also feel more. I have the idea that it can be more than a thousandth, but do not exceed too much, do not prescribe a general criterion of two thousandths. In addition, many prisoners are included as life imprisonment, leaving the county, and are concentrated in batches by the state to engage in production such as road construction, river repair, reclamation and housing. For example, the southwest district is ready to kill another 60,000 people, killing some 30,000 civilians indignation, while the remaining 30,000 people are responsible for centralized production in batches. If the population is calculated at a point five thousandth of the population, there are more than 150,000 people in the three regions of Southwest, Central South and East China, which is a lot of productivity. Guizhou Province thinks not to kill three thousandths will not meet the principles of quasi-and ruthless. I think that according to the 10 million population of Guizhou has killed 13,000, and the Provincial Committee has requested to kill another twenty-two thousand to 25,000. We can allow them to kill more than 10,000 more, leaving more than 10,000 not to kill, already more than two thousandth of the proportion, already more than two thousand, according to According to such a special situation in Guizhou, it has been accurate and ruthless.' (12)\\nIn this way, Guizhou's 'anti-bandits', which lasted a year and a half, according to data released by the Guizhou Provincial Government, is 'annihilation of 140,000 shareholders', but according to Professor Wang Haiguang, there are nearly 300,000 people. (Remarks 12)\\nSome people say that Zhang Guotao is actually more than a Zhang Guotao? Later, sports-indiscriminate killing-misdemean-slaughter, 'followed by repeated history, almost became a law of blood, creating many tragic human tragedies. \\nHuman head is not a leek, cut can still grow up; once the head falls, human life is over forever, no matter who, how can you kill and kill, at will it? \\nOthers or songs, the dead are long. For 60 years, what other power person has publicly apologized to the victims and their people and said publicly 'sorry'? Such killings, which were originally confined to the 'Soviet District' and 'border areas' and other localized areas such as the 'Soviet District' and 'border areas', began to spread to the whole country with the Communist Party of China in power. \\nThe first use of anti-revolutionary charges by the Chinese Communist Party was in the central Soviet district, especially in the anti-AB regiment. And this 'wilful and indiscriminate killing' is tens of thousands of people, and they are all 'class brothers' of the Communist Party itself. \\nA research article pointed out that: AB regiment in southwest Gansu district, southwest China, killed more than 70,000 the Red Army, the Red 20 army was surrounded by the Central Red Army and gathered together, and more than 7,000 people were collectively killed. When the Social-Democratic Party of Southwest China, Suzhouqing Social Democratic Party in Southwest China, only one of the 30 district committees in the Soviet district could work normally. For the Red 25 Army 12,000 people, only 6 days after the rebellion Thousands of people, more than four cadres of the Red Army platoon were basically killed; the rebellion in the Xiange Xiu district brought 50,000 people down to 4,000 people, killing only five party members... The Central Soviet District has 'mistakenly killed' 100,000 people (General Shaoke's recollection). \\nZunyi revolt generals at that time were many. Why alone was the Bai Hui chapter alone in a single person who was fleeing? Of course, on September 14, 1952 was killed in Zunyi Fenghuang Mountain and another general of the resistance, that is, Jiang Zai-zhen, a new division of the Kuomintang who was responsible for blasting up the Yellow River Bridge and the Garden Entrance. \\nThe generals killed in the 'town counter' can be slightly classified:\\n(i), The largest number of returnees who were dismissed after the surrender of the 'intifada' at the end of the counter-insurgenc"},
            {"memoirTitle": "", "memoirAuthor": "", "memoirContent": "y war and released after being captured. \\n(ii), The number of persons who have been retired from their homes for several years, living in business or in other professions (e.g. teachers, lawyers, etc.), is also significant. \\n(iii), The number of those who persist in resistance, fight guerrilla and eventually captured in combat, as well as those belonging to the national, military and gendarmerie systems are not significant. \\n(iv), A small number of others, such as those who fled the field for fear, have been identified in secret names. \\nBai Hui chapter belongs to the first one. At that time, some local governments had difficulties in killing according to their targets. Bai Hui Zhang was a general of the uprising. How could I say to kill or kill. However, in March and July 1950, the central government of the Communist Party of China issued instructions twice to suppress the 'counter-revolution', but, because people's thinking was still trapped in the policy of leniency during the war. The strength is not big enough. \\nAs a result, in October 1950, the CPC Central Committee issued a counter-township directive, the famous 'double ten instructions', warning all regions to correct the 'right' tendency to 'leniency'. The 'Double Ten Instructions' was a turning point, the town's anti-movement has since been vigorously launched, and a group of 'counter-revolutionary elements' were sent to the guillotine. (Remarks 13)\\nBai Hui chapter is finally hard to escape doom\\nGuizhou information port has an article that says this way: since the Bai Hui chapter is used as a United War object, how can it be counterproductive by the town? Later, a resistance veteran Li Sunsheng told me that finally unraveled the fascination. At that time, the government invited him to participate in the CPPCC. Bai Hui Zhang, for the Huan Hai sinking, had long seen the red dust, so only wanted to escape the world So, rejecting, shedding away is not ordered, do not want to kill the evil! (Remarks 15)\\nI am afraid that the scourge of killing is not just the pretext of the shadows, almost thirty years after the killing of Bai Hui Zhang. In the early 1980s, the private butler Ge Shicai, the old man of Bai Huizhang, told a dusty past to come to Beijing. Someone in Beijing once came to join the Zunyi court case officer on the 'Bai Hui Zhang borrowed Uncle Bai (Bai Hui Zhang), Huizhang father), to take the slide for the name, use the slider to send guns and ammunition to the bandits' He asked the Ge Shicai old man, and Ge replied: 'There is no such thing. The fact is that at the beginning of liberation, Bai Hui Zhang sent Grandpa Bai to his six brother-in-law in Suiyang County to take a break After the electric uprising, he gave me (walk), to send a letter to Suiyang, let his father immediately take the slide back to Zunyi. \\nThis memories of the most historical value, Bai sent a slide rod to Suiyang to pick up his father, went out to be seen by passers-by, later this plot was denounced, and became a slide rod to send guns and ammunition to the bandits. This evidence is the most powerful handle to kill the Pak Hui chapter in terms of killing in accordance with the indicators of killing people, is worried that there is no evidence of evidence. \\nPeople who came from the 1950s of the last century know that every whole movement, as long as someone denounced or false accusations, you are fleeing. \\nIn his long documentary novel of 'Lai Yongchu' published on the Internet, Wang Ma mentioned a person called Daiqing River, who used to be a bandits in the mountains of Qianbei, and later joined Qianjun, participated in the riots after liberation. After being arrested, 'the victim also implicated the Bai Hui chapter', Wang Vest's waistcoat only one sentence, unclear, but You can imagine that era, as long as a little careless, unprovoked woes change from heaven. \\nIn addition, that is, the five brothers of the Bai Hui chapter mentioned above, this person is completely a rogue of eating and drinking and gambling. After liberation, people were encouraged to participate in the counter-revolutionary riots, and later captured because they had a background of Bai Hui chapter, which caused the authorities to pay great attention, this rogue for life, actually bitten and false accusations of their hands. Foot, and autographed signature, thus becoming a terrible proof of guilt in the desperate situation. \\nJiang Xiaofang said that in the second half of 1982, he graduated from Suzhou University of Technology, and stayed in his hometown with his father, Bai Li Huiyi hometown for half a year, when some relatives of the Bai family were present, and talked about the tragic tragedy of the inexplicable murder of Bai Hui Zhang. Jiang Xiaofang's second sister, that is, Bai Guanqiu asked about being in jail for more than 20 years. Why did the Baemin Chapter, just released from jail soon, have nothing in the cell? False accusations against their loved ones, Bai Minzhang actually said, 'In order to live, the Bai family always have to stay a few people down' to prevaricate, cynical news of grief, outrage, outrage, denounce 'what use to leave your iniquity?!' \\nMs. Bai Guanqiu has been ancient, she and Bai Hui Zhang two brother most exchanges, after the victory, she followed two brother in Shanghai lived a period, Bai Guan Qiuyuan married Zunyi Luohuiwu large household Luo Huiwu daughter-in-law, (Luohuiwu liberation after the liberation of the mountain when the bandits were shot), she was not satisfied with this marriage, is a flee Run out to Shanghai to find two brother, Bai Hui Zhang is also happy to stay around to take care of her. \\nIn fact, Bai Guanqiu attended Liu Haisu in the early 1930s of the last century, and Zunyi Zhou Lin (former secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Committee for 10 years, President of Nanjing University, Minister of Education, etc.), was an alumni. In the early 1980s, the domestic political climate has been eased. Zhou Linte invited old classmates Bai Guanqiu to stay in Beijing for a small week. Zhou Lin accompanied the tour of attractions, during which she inquired about the possibility of Zhoulin's own Ergobai Huai Zhang Ping, Zhou Lin's answer is quite historical depth and vision: 'The case of Bai Hui Zhang is not It is a general question of justice, but involves the unifying war dimension.' \\nThis should be the footnote that the Pak Hui chapter so far has not been reversed. \\nToday, there are too many people who call for 'not let the hero bleed again to tears!' \\nThe future of a country depends to a large extent on how it faces its own past. It is in this sense that a people's tragedy can actually be its wealth, and the refusal to exploit this wealth often leads a people to step in the dead end of history. Many times, refusing to reflect, 'let it past', often lead to a cycle of death of suffering. (Remark 16)\\nBai Hui zhang's private housekeeper once recalled that after the victory of Pai in the streets of Shanghai once asked fortune teller, fortune teller said Mr. good, but like flowers have blossomed...\\nWho is responsible for the death of Pak Hui chapter? \\nThroughout the life of Bai Hui Zhang, in fact, survived in the middle of the two major political blocs of the National Communist Party. He is not the Communist Party, nor is that of the Chiang Kai-shek group. Is this a personal tragedy? \\nAt the end of the article, I think of Engels saying in front of Marx's tomb: 'he would have many had opponents, but he had little one personal enemy. He had many opponents, but never had a private enemy.' \\nThis is perhaps the best interpretation of his murder. \\nData Citation:\\nBaidu Wikipedia 'Wang Jialie'\\nBlog: 'Today, I focus on two anti-Japanese generals' between Huang Huai 2\\nQianjun anti-Japanese Jin brigade 102 division wearing grass shoes to fight the war only forward 3\\nZheng Xinfen Finishing Pai Chapter with 102 Division 4/17\\nSu Lian Bai Hui Zhang whose affairs 'Zunyi Republic military and political figures' 5/6/11\\nGe Shi-cai dictated Su Lian finishing Bo Hui chapter does not go to Taiwan 'Zunyi Republic military and political figures' 7/9/10\\nTwo Leisure Hall Bunko Rescue Mainland Scholar 8\\n360-degree website 'The list of more than 100 anti-Japanese generals killed after liberation by the town-the truth' 13\\nDeng Wenchu Legal Website: 'Strict Beat' and 'Rule of Law' Dilemma 12\\nMeitan online cheerful look back on the post 'singing through the silent night' 14\\nGuizhou information port special information 15\\n[Southern Weekend]2010-7-15 How to make it past Liu Yu 16\\nJuly 17, 2010 Apartment in Guiyang\\n18 Sep 2010 Modified in Sanya"}
