				"memoirContent": "【Attached】Wen Wei Bao: 'To promote a policy of strength in the publishing world, rightists bare barely wrapped up' (1957.7.25)\\n[Wen Wei Bao, July 26, 1957] The symposium on anti-right struggle in the publishing world in Shanghai continued yesterday afternoon to expose the activities of the editors of Shanghai Cultural Publishing House and former deputy chairman of the Democratic Party Branch of the Shanghai Cultural Publishing House and the faithful implementation of Zhang Bojun's anti-party line. Chou biao Biao is a faithful implementer of Zhang Bojun-Xia Gaoyang's anti-party line. Last spring, the feud biao and Xia Gaoyang met. He immediately dropped a letter to the internal publication 'Organizing Life' of the Party Party of Agriculture and Labour Democratic Party Party, in which letter put Xia Gaoyang on the day. At this time, one was recruiting troops to buy a horse, one willing to sell himself and trust. Naturally, it was a snap. Soon, the feud was introduced by Xia Gaoyang to join the A&M Democratic Party. He also managed to enter the Shanghai Cultural Publishing House as an editor. From then on, under the direct instructions of Xia Gaoyang, he recruited soldiers for the Democratic Party of Agricultural Workers and Workers, and wholeheartedly walked for Zhang Bojun and Xia Gaoyang. \\nThe hatred has done everything possible to expand Xia Gaoyang's so-called 'power policy'. He asked for an organizational member of the Shanghai Cultural Publishing House Branch of the A&M Democratic Party to expose that from November of last year to May this year, the only content of organizational life in the branch was the development of members. He first placed members in various departments of the society, and then developed to other publishing houses, and then expanded to other publishing houses. Exhibits 13 cultural, educational and artistic units in the city, and even to the foreign port. The 'principle' of organizing the development of its members is 'rather abusive' ('abuse' refers to people close to the Communist Party). He particularly appreciated those who had problems with political history or were dissatisfied with the party, as well as comrades who made sharp opinions during the resignation. It is very despicable to develop the way in which the A&M Democratic Party members are working in grass-roots units. Threats, lures, blows and greets everything is extremely useful. In a 10-member joint speech to Zhang Lunpei, the Cultural Press School revealed these ugly practices. Gu Yawen, editor of the cultural publishing house, has also uncovered the abhorrent act of using editorial powers to unscrupulously ask authors to join the A&M Democratic Party. Due to the 'efforts' of the hate label, he received the appreciation of his master Xia Gaoyang, and praised the agricultural and industrial branch under the manipulation of the hatreds as 'model branch'. \\nAfter developing a group of members, the hate label believes that there is 'strength', and it can 'stand up with the Communist Party Chamber', that is, blatantly spreading fallacies. He Chou biao said: The feud distorted the policy of 'long-term coexistence and mutual supervision', saying that 'mutual supervision is mainly the monitoring of the Communist Party by democratic parties'. During the great vigorous enlargement, the feud marks delusions and the Communist Party sings against the platform, further set fire everywhere and wants to bring down the party. He used agro-worker members of various departments to spy on news and collect materials as capital to attack the party. At the symposium, people continued to expose and repudiate the words and deeds of the right-wing Sang Ding's anti-party and anti-people. People are also asked to sign up and quickly and thoroughly to account for relations and activities with right-wing elements. (Wen Wei Bao 1957.7.25)"

Call from Los Angeles. The reason is that I sent an email asking for Mr. Channin's opinion-and I'm going to post one of the things she talked about in my blog. \\nQian ning, female, born in 1931, graduated from the Department of Physics in Tsinghua. He left China on January 14, 1976 and served as the first editor-in-chief of Science and Technology News (published in the United States), in 1980. \\nThe older sister was very rigorous, she agreed to publish, but said that it had to be revised, and she asked me to wait for her revision. \\nBig sister is also very talkative. In a 3-hour phone call, she talked about many things that opened my eyes, one of which I was deeply shocked. \\nI'll tell you about it. \\n'You know what? On October 1, 1949, I participated in the opening ceremony parade and was the slogan among the students of Tsinghua University. \\n'Yes?' I am particularly interested. \\n'To participate in this parade, I made the conditions, and they all promised my terms!' \\n'What conditions did you mention?' \\n'It was like this. At that time, there was no bus from Tsinghua to urban areas. The school was not sure whether the students would walk so far to attend the opening ceremony. So I came to talk to me at school, let me organize students to attend Tiananmen Square State Festival-do you know why I was looking for? In our Tsinghua candidates, I scored the first and influential. \\n'I promised to organize students to participate in the march, and they asked me to call for a slogan. So I made two conditions: one, not to shout 'Long live Chairman Mao'; and second, not to shout 'Long live the Communist Party. '' \\n'Do you mention such a condition?' I was greatly surprised! \\n'I have reason to wow! I said the following reasons: Chairman Mao is not a feudal emperor. Shouting 'Long live Chairman Mao' is to degrade Chairman Mao and degrade the revolutionary leader to the feudal emperor. This is a great disrespect for Chairman Mao. \\n'To the Communist Party can not shout 'long live'! Marx has said that the party is dead and communism is coming. If the Communist Party is' long live ', isn't communism coming without time? \\n'Theory, there should be consistent logic. It is only in line with the logic of Marxist theory by not shouting 'Long live Chairman Mao' and not 'Long live the Communist Party'. \\nI listened to stay and deeply compromised. \\nOver the microphone, the big sister laughed: 'My conditions they all promised, we went to Tiananmen Square. I just did not shout 'Long live Chairman Mao 'and 'Long live the Communist Party,' and naturally many classmates did not shout. But one of the classmates shouted. He was desperately shouting, 'Long live Chairman Mao'. Other students were looking at him: you also came from the Tsinghua Garden, feudal emperor consciousness!' \\nNot to shout 'Long live Chairman Mao', not 'Long live the Communist Party'. This is the consciousness of Chinese students in Tsinghua in 1949! The unforgettable consciousness! \\nPerhaps, in 1949, the consciousness of the students of Tsinghua could 'represent' the consciousness of college students at that time-because the school promised her 'no shouting', the vast majority of students also 'don't shout'-not shouting, it represents progress, this is the progress of the times! \\nI suddenly remembered Gu Zhun. \\nSomeone once said, 'Thanks to Gu Zhun, it was only to restore the collective reputation of our nation's ideological community in that shameful era.' And I think Gu Zhun can't do this. In that era, China's ideological circles did not have a reputation. The Chinese thought community in the 50s and 60s is probably not as much as the 'thought' of the Chinese college students in the late 40s. \\nAt the time of Gu's predicament, Big Sister Qian ning also fell, and she was classified as 'extreme right'-this is also logical. \\nShe went to prison and was in a cell with Li Jiantong Guan, author of Liu Zhidan. \\nShe was almost shot dead a little bit-in 1970, Lin Biao ordered that each county should shoot two people for a limited time. She was a 'candidate' for 'shooting'. \\nShe paid the price for her progressive action-action to put Marxist theory into practice. \\nShe left the country miraculously in January 1976-when it was harder to go abroad than in heaven. By the 80s, there were many children from mainland China who 'laid the ground' at her home in Los Angeles. \\nNow, she has been nearly a year, in her own words, is 'busy between the two sides of the Pacific, do not know how to do it right', but always constantly doing...\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"

I gave up my university studies and participated in the national forces and invested in the fight against the flames of Japan and Kou. At the end of the 8-year victory of resistance, I agree with Mr. Mao Zedong's claim that 'freedom, democracy, oppose authoritarian dictatorship and form a coalition government after the war.' However, seeing the civil war inevitable, I thought myself if I could take up arms and shelling my compatriots because I was resisting Japan, and I left my troops from the Hubei front line and returned to Hangzhou. However, I have been trained by three military schools, including the National Huangpu Military Academy, and have become a professional officer and have no skills to earn a living, and still join the local military organ. Work. \\n1949 Hangzhou 'liberation', on the eve of my personal stay, inevitably have a choice due to:\\n1. I heed the Communist Party's call to 'Chinese people do not fight the Chinese people', 'to lay down their weapons is a friend', 'never blame in the past, have won the award', 'do not retreat with the reactionaries, participate in the construction of new China' and so on. \\n2, my parents also taught me, 'you are a national soldier, do not belong to a certain faction, there are also many old officers in the Red Army of the Soviet Union, many of your classmates are also in the PLA.' \\n3. I think that because of the situation at home and abroad, the KMT is unable to fight again, and the Communist Party originally did not want a civil war. Therefore, regardless of 'war' or 'talk', the reunification of the motherland is in the immediate sight, I can go to the new China's coalition government army to exercise the role of military personnel to guard the land and protect the people. \\n4, I live without problems, my wife waiting to give birth, have not done bad things. Therefore, I am determined to stay, save the warehouse under my jurisdiction for the PLA officers to receive it. Originally intended to send me to the Shanghai Military Academy for study, considering that my wife is pregnant and giving birth, there is no problem with my local life, I will handle my return to production. Later with people co-organized a soy sauce brewing factory, not employing workers, homemade, self-owned, self-selling, business very good, life calm. \\nOn April 27, 1951, I was arrested in the town counter-movement. During the interview, the cadre only questioned once and said: 'Your father is the KMT warlord. You participated in the reactionary army in the war of resistance, as well as pseudo-positions such as platoon regiments. You are hostile to the people. You are specially trained by the reactionaries and into military schools and land. Military University, not afraid of no official, what do you stay for? In liberation, we used false merit to try to mix into the inside of my revolution for destruction. We the Communist Party is talking about material things. You can't deceive it.' \\nI said, 'I am a subordinate officer of the 27th group army in the war of resistance. Why is it true and false?' \\nThe cadre said: 'You reacted through the top.' A butt hit on my head. Immediately, I was handcuffed and arrested. \\nLater, a tabloid newspaper in Hangzhou published 'Lurking gangster special Qian qing has been shot.' \\nImmediately, my wife went to Hangzhou's pine shop and other places to search for my body. My body is missing (I will learn later). \\nLater, the Court's Judgment on charges of 'use of ancestry for counter-revolutionary activities' and sentenced to 20 years through labour. \\nThe ancestral house 1,600 square meters forfeiture, watches, cameras, bicycles confiscated, mahogany furniture set also confiscated (someone else borrowed my home). My wife and my eldest son, a newborn baby, moved out of the house. \\nLater, my family broke down, and the reason on the Divorce Judgment was: 'Couple emotion is general, because Qian qing is a counter-revolution must draw the boundaries.' In the future, I was reguilty and escorted Subei to labor reform and atonement. (Although she changed to marry, still a [straight] letter to his wife, encouraged me to fight for a new birth at an early date.), \\nSubei suffered cold, ice breaking water conservancy. Because of the crowds of ants gathered for a moment, the equipment for living medical conditions was difficult to keep up with, and spread dysentery extensively, I was dying after dying, and was cured by the party and the government. \\nIn 1953, the area for some reason was a temporary shortage of food, I had been shocked, and the government (rescue), returned. \\nIn about 1955, the team site passed me to declare: 'Our people's government is looking for facts, there must be a mistake. After checking the fact that you have not used your ancestral heritage to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, you will now quash your previous sentence of 20 years by mistake, but you have been in the past for pseudo-duty and historical crimes must be certain, and you will be sentenced to re-education for four years.' I said, 'My office orders are issued by the state, and I have not been traitors, so come to the false post?' The cadre shouted and said: 'Go out, go out.' A gently grievance, I escaped the dead, but nothing has been done. \\nIn the spring of 1956, as a citizen of the People's Republic of China, I returned to Hangzhou by a state-owned farm in northern China to settle for employment, and issued me 'Voter's Card' to participate in the election. I was homeless, and I had a bed in the 6-square-meter mud room of the divorced husband and mother's family. My wife changed to marry in Shanghai. Back, I said, 'I have nothing to raise you.' \\nThe older child is 8 years old, followed by mother-in-law, the second child has also been 6 years old because he could not afford to raise, since childhood gave to the farmer for adoption, I am alone. \\nEconomically, I give the various units and organs carved steel plates, write materials to do temporary work. At night, the bamboo, wood chips, metal pieces of bamboo, and other materials for toys, such as bamboo dragonflies, trolley run, borrowed in small shops on the street. The masses did not discriminate against me, saying it is 'current situation'. \\nI gave the neighborhood assistant blackboard newspaper, and was also responsible for teaching as a literacy teacher. The father of the leader of the Mingade said to me: 'Everyone needs to be transformed in different ways and methods. You are still young and have many old relationships. You can do the work of the People's Reform Unification War in the future, and now learn about advanced civil leather.' \\nBecause I was originally a 'left-leaning child disease' patient, and a 'fatalism', I chose the road to join the army against Japan and cast together, so the day was full of sunshine on their own future. In the future, home-drawn police comrades asked me to fill out the table, saying that I would be assigned me to school as a teacher, and asked me 40 bucks of salary enough Not enough, I was busy saying, 'Enough, enough.' \\nLater Chairman Mao called on everyone to comment on the party and the government, help the party to rally, and the people were not guilty. Some people took the opportunity to attack the party and the government. In 1957, Chairman Mao launched an anti-right movement, and a large number of right-wing activists were dealt with, saying that Chairman Mao's 'snakes out the hole' victory with his big strategy, the government promulgated in a timely manner Re-education through Labour Regulations. \\nAt the end of 1957, the director of the police station called me to go. I think I was dispatched to become a teacher, and I went again. \\nThere are more than a dozen people sitting in the hall, like a meeting. The director said today I had a debate with you, and it has already been dealt with. \\nThe director said: 'What other opinions do you have on Qian Bingkun' and asked three or four times no voice. \\nThe director said: 'Well, everyone's opinion is to send you to re-education through labor, you signed.' \\nI was again detained in detention. I sleepless at night, I lost a little freedom, and a little hope also turned into a shadow. All I had was a 'Citizen's Voter' hidden in a chest underwear pocket. I want to cry without tears! \\nDuring the period of re-education through labour, it coincides with the great leap forward of how fast and good, the people all need to do so. Our dictatorship objects are of course to build roads up to the mountain, build Xieng Xieng in the sea, and night to atonement, and the 'three years of natural disaster' of pong seven man-made disasters, especially the attrition of our group of people is imaginable Knowing, my lower limbs are swollen close to the abdomen, can't walk, fortunately, and Chairman Liu Shaoqi adopted' 'Three from one package' policy, practical and responsive to the hearts of the people, the national economy has been able to quickly improve, and how many lives have been saved. Again, I am left dead. \\nIn the winter of 1962, I declared that I had performed well and discharged them from re-education through labour, but not to return to society, and must work in the production units of the public security system. I sent to a building materials factory in Changxing to open the mine. The saying goes: 'If you want to be, open stone mine.' Enterprises make more money, but the production staff is heavy labor, dangerous, work injuries often, listen to the fate. Working hours were working day and night, and until I was 58 years old I was still swinging 20 pounds of big hammer under the rock wall of the mountain. Wages increase up to $26 per month. \\nBecause of heavy labor, large food, supplement to black market food, side eclipse daily necessities to buy food card almost. \\nNo matter whether re-education through labour, re-education through labour, employment field workers, there is little change in the learning situation of working life. The food quantity of the most concern is divided into three levels according to labor results. 'Eat more and less, eat less', monthly mutual assessment, minus you, can add me. Living is a collective dormitory on the upper and lower floor of the whole shop, when crowded to sleep, generally do not turn off the lights at night. No tables and chairs each to bring a small bench, eat, write in the bed, medical care, burial full labor. \\nWhen (prison re-education through labour management center), after the farm attendant, the government pays monthly wages, the meal card can be handled by itself. After taking leave approval, you can go to a nearby town to buy some food items. If there are immediate family members, family visit leave can be granted. \\nAt the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, wages fell to 18 yuan per person per month, and all underwear were covered with black lacquered tong oil and black box of three characters 'stayed offender'. Top cover front and back, pants are covered on the knees. \\nOut is also canceled, fully closed. Fortunately, there is still political treatment, with a collective vote of glorious vote in the civil elections. \\nAlthough the teaching cadres enlighten us: 'Labour is the right of citizens, you have citizenship rights, prisoners have no citizens, you have hair, and the prisoners have no hair.' And he said, You have hair, and you have citizenship. And we also understand that labor is still waiting for a heavy prison term, and we live in life to create wealth for the people and atonement for the people. Suffering, one day, January, a year, ten years, twenty years, you often see a pair of dazzling eyes, muttering: 'Marlan, marlan, field attendant years and rain.' \\nAt last, the 'four evil gangs' are full of evil, more evil will kill themselves, be crushed by the people, and the people cheer all the days together. \\nIn 1979, in the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Comrade Xiaoping led the country's revolt to reform and opening-up, and the government returned me back to Hangzhou to arrange employment. But I'm over 60 years old. \\nAt that time, the national economy was damaged by four people for two or 30 years, and the people were in great difficulty, and the government asked me to wait for as much as possible to produce self-help and struggle together. I also made a living with honor printing. In accordance with the policy, self-financing, self-financing and self-financing, self-financing, self-financing, self-financing, self-financing, self-financing and loss, we set up a reputation printing house, as stipulated in the regulations, in charge of public reform. Monthly payment of management fees, typing, printing, binding, and in order to realize the much-needed teaching materials, Information, etc., to address the employment of some young people and the social sector. \\nI pay the national tax and the civil leather processing fee, I keep the trust abroad, the weight of the quality of the internal diligence and frugal office, the business developed, I also earn living expenses, and the municipal United Front War Department also praised. \\nThe company applied for closure in 1995. I have no food and clothing, my own life, my children and grandchildren have a career, academic success, some have entered the team and joined the party. With pain, Chairman Mao said to establish a free democracy, oppose authoritarian dictatorship, no one oppresses people, no one exploits people, prosperous, strong, peaceful and happy, while the 'four-man gang' led by Jiang Qing bewles, deceives and obscures Chairman Mao, and has artificially created the 'nature of the whole country' 'Disaster', 20 years after the founding of the country, a pound of rice, one or two oil, a piece of tofu, every year 5 feet of cloth are needed Controlling the ticket, the national economy faces a collapse. \\nPolitically provoking the people to fight against the people, inflicting criminal charges, arbitrary arrests, people are at risk, and even the President of the State has framed, criticized for abuse and persecution to death. In short, the trick of the four gang is possible to deal with the enemy, 'soldiers do not hate to cheat', and to rule the country, it is difficult, the country has no peace of the day. \\nNow, the great and good situation in China's common prosperity is due to comrade Xiaoping and the Party Central Committee's intrigues and policies of reform and opening-up and seeking truth to rule the country by law. President Jiang promoted 'to govern the country in Germany', 'do things in good faith', and to serve the people with the theory of 'three representatives', to the people of the whole country, and to build lasting peace and stability in the motherland. After the 16th National Congress, new leaders such as President Hu proposed 'people-oriented', to talk about humanity, 'sprinkle all human beings are love', and society is full of warmth. \\nI am 86 years old, I am not much in the coming day, asking myself: life is not negative to the country, no negative to the people, and I have no resentment of volunteering to take the socialist path. And he was wronged, resulting in the separation of wives and the death of the family. The houses, furniture, bicycles, etc. confiscated due to the criminal case have not yet been returned, and have not even been granted. Another 20 years of error, the entire age of the age, controlled labor in the production units of the public security system and created wealth for the people. \\nExplicit correction and correction, admit 22 years of work order. And the elderly retired life, medical labor protection is not. \\nView living alone 12 square solitary suite, looking back on a lifetime of misery, reasons did two big mistakes:\\n, should not risk their lives, put into the battlefield of anti-Japanese flames, become a reactionary, counter-revolutionary, should continue to study, become professors or chief workers, and serve the society safely. \\nSecond, it should not be honest, should flee the mainland and, according to its own conditions, 'not afraid of having no authority'. Hing said that the official was big. My left-leaning element may be a cornerstone of the cause of the reunification of the motherland. At least like the general tour that Taiwan came to the mainland last year, it is not lost as a guest, and how can it become a prisoner. \\nBefore I was 'liberated', there was a naive and ignorant concept, believing that the CPC and the two parties were just two teams in the 'Chinese University'. They were all classmates, turning teams, and unusual things. My relatives, friends, colleagues and classmates all have Communist Party people. I have not fought with the PLA. During the war of resistance, the Communist Party cadres made friends with us. Thought that the National Army and the Communist Army are the national army, I am a soldier, and listen to whoever is in power. Both parties flaunt democracy, freedom, patriotic, patriotic, patriotic. Standing on the position that I am a Chinese citizen, I leave a group and get out of the civil war, I have no guilt for 'betraying the enemy.' \\n(Save Hangzhou Baoshan Bridge and other armoury, such as detonation, there is a burning sulphur bomb seized by the Japanese army, the lower city is finished.), \\nBesides, I have been called 'KMT officers'. In fact, I never applied for membership in the party, nor paid a party fee or participated in a party activity. There was no KMT organization in the army at all. Therefore, without considering their future, believing that they can continue to serve the country, they are recklessly honored. After liberation, I knew that I was a bourgeois reactionary that Chairman Mao's proletarian command had to fight with him or her life and death. It was not enough for civilians to be angry. I had long known this. I had 'escaped from death.' \\nI was sentenced to four years of labor reform for historical counter-revolutionary crime, and was charged with the two palace counts:\\n(1), 'I did not go to false officials to register and conceal identity', should I not register, but also want to win the prize, I want to join the army in the future. I work locally in Hangzhou for many years and wear more military uniforms on weekdays. Not only do I know me by my neighbors, have my identity hidden? Have you checked the registration file? \\n(2), 'Play Jin Bao' is Jin Debao, a rogue in the Guan Lane area. Later, he participated in the anti-Republican Salvation Army and was killed by the PLA in Xiao Shan. One day I said to my wife, 'I met Kim Debao in blackmail a man's watch, said that the man hit him, I pulled to beat him, he slipped away.' \\nThat's it. I went to the court to praise, the judge said, 'Counterrevolutionary! There is always sin in history, think about it yourself.' \\nI thought it was always true, right? In fact, in ancient times, Chinese and foreign governments must have civil servants, and can't say that they were bad in the past, how do we think of the present in the future? \\nAs a result of the above crimes, I spent the whole life of my youth and old age. \\nIt can be described as a 'labor professional.' I work for the production units of the public security system for decades, day and night, free or nearly free of charge, to create wealth for the people. I am an innocent Chinese citizen who was mistaken. \\nI'm old and don't even give a labor insurance. \\nAlthough I was 'unbelievable in my life', I never went to court and had not been tried. I have been in prison, that is, day, month, year and year. Correctional officers did not have insults to me, attitude is very good, and there are still many good people in the world. As for exploitative thinking of the bourgeois, everyone does not exploit others. \\nAfter I returned to Hangzhou, a instructor in the factory passed through Hangzhou by the way to see me, saying: 'You guys leave the factory, have to give the identification, generally speaking of this person in the factory good performance, you guys said this person is very bad. The factory said that this person did not perform well, you said that this person was good, but for your identification, can be said consistent.' I said, 'How to evaluate?' He said, 'Summarize, a 'hard' word, good words do not say, bad things do not do.' In the hardest days of my life, I did not apply for relief from the government, society. \\nWhy am I 86 years old to apply for retirement? \\n(A), the central leadership teaches the rule of law, moral rule, benevolence, reason, justice, equality, integrity. \\n(2), The rapid development of our national economy, people's life into a healthy welfare, I should be entitled to retirement labor insurance, I can go into the hospital for a few years to live more, financially I have security, and can help anti-Japanese veterans and orphaned elderly people like me. \\n(3), to find a bit of balance, a cow, flat white was caught to pull the car, push the fields for two or 30 years old, give it a few bunches of hay, but too much? In the previous two years, I appealed to seven or eight units of relevant letters and calls that I should be retired and went to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to implement the policy, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau's letter and call office said: 'Yes, the retirement should be retired, the retirement will be retired, but there is no work unit before your wrong case, and go up there. What about real?' However:\\n(A), I work for 22 years of labor, should be given retirement, and has nothing to do with the previous work unit. \\n(2), Again, the work unit was assigned by the government. I had no working unit before, precisely because the Public Security Bureau mistakenly arrested me, otherwise I went to teach or do another job early. \\n(3), In general, I am working in state-owned enterprises, not private enterprises. The results of labor are government benefits, and the government should give retirement labor insurance. As a result, I was asked to find a solution to the superior leadership. The superior said: 'You go to the original Public Security Bureau.' The leader's doorman said: 'We have a letter room.' As such, I was pushed and pushed and ran for more than a year. It is precisely a wall composed of letters and calls, it is really 'implaceable letters and interviews'. \\nSome people want to say that I'm whistling, yes, an old cow, when we know that humans want to slaughter it, it can only listen to God's fate, but also have feelings, but also silently tears, not to mention people! If there is no human nature, then selfish and cold, hurting things, doing nothing, society does not speak of humanity, perverse, ingenuity, hatred, you die and live and live, social unrest, these have all been painfully experienced. \\nThe above I stop writing intermittent, written for more than 5 months because of angina pectoris, tears, pen kilos, difficult to drop. \\nOn the night of my arrest, the window was under light rain, I was handcuffed, I stood by my bed, gazing at a young child under two years of sleep, a weak wife, waiting to give birth, with tears, a single dress on my shoulder, an old military suit worn in the war of anti-Japanese, I walked into a long misery. The end of the labor road. Fortunately, anyway, reform and opening-up, I have to reintegrate into society. Now the white sideburns, alone on the lone lamp, life is always awakened as a dream. \\nThe Government grants retirement benefits at the age of 87. \\n86-year-old Qian Bingkun written on July 7-December 9, 2003\\n"

I personally interviewed him and there was no attempt to reverse the remnants of the Kuomintang. \\nAsked myself, I studied in Japan for 6 years and interviewed 22 Japanese army veterans who invaded China. Beginning in 1997, 12 old devils of aggression against China and Japan were received in China and Japan. My biggest experience as a Chinese in Japan is:\\n'We Chinese do not love us Chinese, who will love us Chinese?' \\nThe Japanese are hoping that we will fight forever. \\nWho has played Japan who should rule, it is a philosophy of Nurhaki 'Who hit the mountain customs who should sit on the river'. \\nIf you say: in the period of the Republic of China, during the war of resistance, and civil war, you must die and live between the Chinese people; then, 66 years after the victory of the resistance war! 66 years after the war, we Chinese still have to be hostile forever? Where are our generosity?

The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), believes that the main members of this group are Liu Yiting, Qianqun, Ding Jiang, Xia Hao and others. Liu is the leader. Their reactionary activities include the following three main points: first, resisting and attacking the party's leadership, isolating the kingdom. Liu Zeng publicly said: 'The UPF has nothing to do with the Ministry of Culture and Education and does not accept the leadership of the Ministry of Culture and Education.' The Federation last year summed up its work of checking a year and this time, and this time, were reluctant to allow the Ministry of Culture and Education to participate in their so-called 'internal meetings'. None of the manuscripts of the monthly magazine of Bee has been reviewed by the Ministry of Education and Education. They grabbed some shortcomings in the work of the deputy minister of culture and education, and raided. The Provincial Committee approved Liang Bin and Lin Man two years ago as deputy directors of the WPF, but Liu Yiting has not carried out so far, and openly attacked and excluded Liang Bin and Lin Man on the pretext of irregularity. Their opposition leaders in literary work and advocated the organization of peer publications. In fact, two publications, 'Pear Garden' and 'Bee', have become co-author publications. Second, the direction of the bourgeois is growing. In their publication 'Bees', they have turned right since the first issue of this year, if the approach to serving workers and farmers was changed to 'serving the working people', and their essence was to serve intellectuals, often saying 'farmers do not understand'. Especially the seventh edition of Bee, the bourgeois direction is more pronounced. In July this year, the country is struggling against the right. Instead of publishing an article on the anti-right, Bee has published a lot of articles on attacking party leaders and anti-socialist toxins, and publicly defended the authors of the 'Grasswood' and 'Stars' editorial department.. Third, in order to achieve their anti-party and anti-socialist objectives, they tried to hold the 'Bee' literary forum to attack the party. To this end, they have actively engaged in small group activities to exclude and combat cadres who do not agree with them. They once agreed that five people, including Ding Jiang and Xia Hao, went to the Ministry of Culture and Education to petition for the restructuring of the 'Bee' editorial department and asked Liu Yiting to be their editor-in-chief, and not deputy editor-in-chief Liu Wenbin and secretary Liu Zhensheng."

				"memoirContent": "[Attached] Committee of Renmin University of China: Selected Right-wing Speech in Higher Schools (August 1958)\\n'Recently since the People's Daily, 'Why is this?' After the editorial was published, said that my neurotic people, do not touch their ass, whether they are nervous abnormal, just like anti-counter-revolutionary compounded 5% counter-revolution as busy to find North chaos, as if the beast broke into the Yan Garden, loudly called 'counter-revolution', 'anti-socialist'!! People who are highly debilitated in nerves, listen to the 'class', and say: this is expanding the contradiction, transforming contradictions, ah! Look at the officer: Can there be contradictions because I think so much. If so, then I shouted for the social nature and possession of the private nature of imperialist production, then the conflict between British and American and French capital and workers is expanding (strictly monotonous rise), capitalism will immediately perish, and there is no need for workers' struggle. We supported the World Peace Movement! I think: objective things do not deteriorate because people know different, otherwise it is anti-Marxism, that is, 'Marxist' who sells dogs (meat), of sheep heads...'\\n'Fortunately, write down the main arguments, starting from Lenin on the definition of class, try the reality:\\n1. The possession of the means of production is mainly in the hands of military and political dignitaries-a worker does not have the right to intervene in production because it is not in the hands of the masses. \\n2. The distribution is unreasonable, with those who are unremunerated for work (otherwise why wage reform), much more can be described as exploitation. \\n3. Social status (see newspapers for details, from small things in life to political rights, we can only call long live, not 'nine thousand years old', can only be called-'class'-can be called-'goods' from the surface text, verbal to practice, there is a gap). \\n4. Don't trust the people and kill heroes. Just give one example, as far as the big print newspaper is concerned, why does Secretary Cui have a cold attitude, this is to believe in the masses, is there the ability to identify whether or not? Kill the chicken with a cattle knife to monitor a citizen overnight with four people? ... This is trust...' (Peking University Qian ruping Ruping)\\n'After the triumph of land reform, then capitalist industrial and commercial transformation, and so on, the old class relations were shattered, so it seems from existing theory that our country has basically eliminated class, and the guardians did not think about it. In 1957, today in theory, in 1957, in theory, you are full of Foot, high and frizzy is called 'Long live socialism ', 'Long live Marxist' What is the difference between Buddhist desire to live for a thousand years? ... with the extinction of the old class, the new class has risen again, nature which differs from the old, it has unique features, and rough thinking about the following:\\n1. The ownership of production materials, now the possession is different from the bourgeois, they are more dispersed, now the party, political and military dignitaries in power account for a very small proportion of the country, collective possession, the better name: 'All ownership' is now not easy to see, if you look at the distribution relationship It is even more distinct. \\n2. Distribution, central level cadres pay more than 500 yuan per month... In general, between 40-60 yuan in comparison with ordinary workers, there is also a difference of more than 30 times, as far as I know that even the middle bourgeois does not have such a large net income, because the capitalist has to go back to production. Among them, many of China's middle bourgeois have a total capital. About two thousand dollars, therefore, although not formally exploitative relationships, there is essentially an unequal deal...\\n3. We want to ask whether such a disparity is in line with social labor equivalent exchange? I don't think, it's just taking advantage of the regime-the leaders themselves are interested in material enjoyment, dictated by themselves. In the case of very low productivity of the whole society, if not unequal exchange, it is impossible to differ 800 times, because imagine: you are very lagging productivity around you, you alone can create so much wealth? What is so precious for Chairman Mao to wait for their labor? If you tell the world's farmers, I see very few people in favor. \\n4. Social status, constitutionally stipulates that all citizens are equal. However, in daily life, all kinds of treatment (whether work, study, play, eat...), are hierarchical, clearly unequal, and a small party secretary can cry up to the innocent struggle and impose corporal punishment. How is this different from the attitude of feudal rulers towards farmers? At least a name and way! \\n5. Guardianship of officials. It is clear that a conscious social group has begun to form a social bloc that supports each other, sheltered and have special interests in common economic, political and social status. \\n6. disguised official tolerances exist, but the name of the 'correspondent' is not equal treatment. Tolerance advantages are common, in addition to distrust of citizens, like spy surveillance even more than any time in history. Because the most brutal Kuomintan-China cooperation institute, they also captured people on the basis of at least some facts, even if there were shooting people. However, there are no human rights at all. Life is threatened at all times, and once a violation of the superior nobility, you can be killed in a vain fight for months and with a touch of apology. It can also be seen that this kind of society can be 'comparable' to the rule of exploitative class... What kind of 'good happiness' is this society! If long live such 'socialism', I'd rather fight to death, not to save again, it would be a life of cattle and horse! \\n7. Historically, such as Zhu Yuanzhang, the world began to fight for the masses, cheated everyone's trust together with the people. Once a great success was done to kicked the masses, slaughter heroes and compete for status and fame. Now in our country, it is also clear at a glance by reaching out to a newspaper or asking about Rulin's interior. More many politicians speculators have sharpened their scalp into political parties. Ronghua is rich and powerful and powerful, and gracious. \\n8. Marxism-Leninism was only a sign of those in power, and practical action was guided by another theory. Just like when the Sinhai Revolution miscarriage, now this reality 'long live' goes down, I think the revolution has been aborted, if it does not drastically reverse the current crooked wind...\\nThe income of workers and farmers in China has actually increased little over the years, only the extent of eating and not starving to death...\\nCapitalism is unreasonable, I oppose, but I think it's not enough now to change. The real people who represent the real people's leaders should be to work with the people and respect the great personality of the people; they are the masters of history, and those who sell dog meat must step down. \\nNew class contradictions and old differences can be resolved peacefully using the pressure of the masses and, if necessary, through violence-to indelible. \\nTo radically change the current style and establish a legal system that is sufficient to guarantee the people's freedom and democracy, oppose the deception and propaganda of the masses, oppose the spread of idealism, oppose the existence of privileged classes, stop the massacre and incarceration of unwarranted people; oppose the new disguised class oppression, people need to use themselves Your eyes look at the real world and listen to the sadness of the masses with their own ears Crying, good play bad resolute eradication. If there is a group that resolutely violates the development of society and violates the aspirations of the people, I think the people will surely rise up and attack. Long live the real history creator working people intellectuals! All those who violate the development of history should step down!' (Peking University Qian ruping Ruping)\\n'We have preliminary consultations on how to improve the current government leadership and party and group status:\\n1. revolutionaries should be 'congenital worries, happy after the worries of the world', suggest party members, members of the group to give a part of the money to the organization, as social expenses, so that the actual income is less than other comrades of their peers. Now, on the contrary, it does not reflect the spirit of the revolutionaries, but rather contributes to unfettered demands for material enjoyment. \\n2. In addition to individual particularly good quality comrades, leaders should be changed, re-elected once in three or four years, to elect the typical and exemplary figures of the original masses, so as to ensure that they do not separate from the masses, and have individual experienced people to guide the business, can make the administrative work well. The phrase 'internal contradictions among the people' is too abstract. It should be said that there is a certain economic basis, and there have been some contradictions on issues such as distribution and social status. At present, it is not very sharp, so that internal contradictions are not necessary either. It must be noted, however, that if issues of management distribution, social status, etc. are not better developed, contradictions can move forward and basically satisfy the definition of 'class' relationships. Therefore, in order to face up to the reality and to pay attention to this issue, it is of certain relevance to point out that the new 'class' should not be overstated and vague in the words 'intra-people'. To solve it, it must be resolved economically and politically, and the others are secondary.' (Peking University talk about [Qian ruping Ruping])\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"

				"memoirContent": "【Attached】'Xinmin Evening News': 'Money Thin Iron Legacy: Lu Yan Less Pen'\\nCollector Wang Keqin, has a lot of famous paintings and paintings, and some are still huge masterpieces. However, there are two thin iron brochures (only longitudinal 12 centimeters, 16 centimeters large), Mr. Wang very valued. This is not only because money is always his teacher, but also because two pages of money were not finished in that year. Wang Keqin asked Mr. Lu Yanshao to complete his pen. \\nQian thin iron (1897-1967), famous, word uncle, old age since 'Songbin sick old man'. He was a painting artist of the Shanghai Chinese Academy of Art, is a typical literary painter in modern Chinese calligraphy, seal engraving and painting. In that year, he and Wu Changshuo (No. bitter iron), and crown mountain (ice iron), three people were hailed as 'Jiangnan Santie'. Its calligraphy four body work, long seal; its seal engraved blunt knife hard, clutter ancient Tibet; its painting brush ink and smooth, strong momentum. The most legendary is: in July 1937, Qian Thin Iron went to Japan, and heard that Guo Moro, who wanted to return home in exile to join the rescue campaign, he planned with Guo's friend Jin Zu, and personally escorted Guo Moruo from Tokyo to Kobe secret boarding ship. After Guo Moruo returned home, Qian Skiniron was arrested in Japan and spent four years in jail in Japan. \\nIn the 1960s, Wang Keqin was brought by his father, the late century-old painter Wang Kangle, to the old school of money. At that time, money had just taken the 'right' hat, life was very difficult, but the students were very serious. He painted plum blossoms, cursive plum, ink dripping, Wang Keqin liked, learned very seriously, so today painting plum blossom still has the taste of the teacher. \\nIn 1966, the 'Cultural Revolution' began, the money was the first to be waged by villains, and the collection of paintings, seals, books, etc. were confiscated. At this time, money has been an old old year, suffering from illness, and carrying 'agent' and 'fine rape' and other modesty charges, but still secretly painted more than 20 pages of album pages for Wang Keqin. According to 'Money Thin Iron Chronology' records: On December 17, 1967, Qian Thin Iron met with Mr. Qian Junyi, who was also a calligraphy and seal carver, said: 'It has been difficult to be people in the day, the pain is constant! See you today, may not be able to see you in the future!' After the words are stumbling. The next day, money could not be cured because of emphysema and heart disease, and was ill at home. \\nWang Keqin news, rushed to the teacher's home, the teacher took out more than 20 pages of small paintings to Wang Keqin's hands. Wang Keqin, one of which two pages have not been finished, and no payment has been made, he will take it home to keep it properly. By 1987, Qian's legacy was exhibited at the Shanghai Art Museum for two months. The relevant parties also held a 'Chinese Painting Achievement Seminar'. At this time, Wang Keqin to find out the unfinished work of these two money old, please Lu Yanyan less to fill up, Lu Lao promised. When Wang Keqin takes back the book page and then look, money old donkey and riding donkey, and Lu old painting landscape is really intact, the above there is Lu Lao question: this book number of pages are thin iron before the dyeing of Mr. Iron, fear for a long time to give no test, so it is sufficient. Recall the life tour from the good, great. Mr. Tang Yun met, and also wrote: 'Skinny iron man and the other old trade for decades, have got along with a brother, good is also the same. How fast is the wine at the old Maursurutei? Transient light has been twenty years away, every day apart, much more sense. Ke Qin Xianyou, Ding Mao, Hang Yan Tang Yun. \\n(Xinmin Evening News, 'Money Skinny Iron Legacy: Lu Yan-Less Pen' December 11, 2009)"

He went to Wuhan and went to Guangzhou, and made a short stay at Wuhan University when returning from Guangzhou North, and wanted to see the dynamics there again. Invited by two memorials from Xinhua News Agency Hubei Branch and Hubei Daily to attend the symposium of the student union of Wuhan University. After going, the students must ask to speak, and asked the Guangming Daily to publish their news. Despite repeated rhetoric, they could not stand up to the same demands of the students. They had to simply add a few words: 'Although the Guangming Daily sent me to the field to report on the revelation, the subject is mainly known The top people of the intellectual community. I am sympathetic and supportive to the classmates asking for the revelation, because it was proposed by the Central Committee. However, the revelation of the students is not within the scope of my coverage. Even if it is reported, it is up to the head of the newspaper to decide whether or not the Guangming Daily is published.' After that, I left the venue and the next morning, boarded the train bound for Beijing. At the beginning of the anti-right struggle, following the editor-in-chief of the 'great right' based on the 'party world' theory, Chu Anping, and a group of men, women and young people in the Guangming Daily became right-wing elements. The only charge is: 'sympathy and support for right-wing attacking the party.' However, the male and female students at Wuhan University did not shine on that day. They were merely asking for it. They couldn't talk about 'attacking'. How can they be 'right-wing'? I had to endure in the back, without making any arguments, and signed the Political Conclusions on the Right Party's Qian tonggang General Platform, and accepted the 'dismissal of registrations, the abolition of journalist posts, and lower five salary levels' and distributed to the Beidawang 850 farm labor reform. In addition to President Zhang Bojun and Editor-in-Chief Chu Anping, 17 people were beaten as right-wing elements-Yin Yi, Wang Shaotong, Pan Wenbin, Qian tonggang Tonggang, Qiu Lin, Zheng Xiaofeng, Ou Zhipei, Han Hongwen, Han Yiyun, Xu Ying, Xie Jie, Fan Yuzeng, Xu Zimei, Xiao Enyuan, Li Xiao, Zhang Yinhuai, Yu Friends; more than 20 per cent of editorial staff."

Xie Liqiong, one of the masterminers of Katyusha, went to Peking University to learn about the movement of Ming Fang, participated in the founding meeting of Baihua Society headed by Peking University right-wing Tan Tianrong, and actively contacted with it and organized the Katyusha newspaper at the college. Chou naibo Naibo is planning behind the scenes. As a result, they began a conspiracy to attack the party in an organized and systematic manner. \\nThe second gun to attack the party by this small group is to disrupt the party's rectifying plans and steps, the opposition party's policy of winding, opposing the wind and rain, and actively inciting greater democracy. Sun Dexin arrogant said: '50 Qi Enling, 20 Sun Dexin can achieve greater democracy.' At this point, the school was full of large print papers they posted. and anti-party poetry, etc., to carry out defamatory personal attacks on party leaders of the Academy. \\nIn line with the right-wing leader, Lorongi, they vigorously attacked the anti-rebellion, thereby inciting the masses. Not only did they support the reactionary rhetoric that 'the Academy's rebellion is dominated by forced confessions, supplemented by inducement,' but they also fabricated facts to stigmatize the anti-movement. Chen Dingsha also posted reactionary poems on the party's general branch, demanding 'the pacification of injustice against people.' \\nWhen Ge Peiqi issued reactionary remarks to kill the Communist Party, 'Katyusha' immediately reproduced in the big print, and marked the words 'killing the Communist Party... overthrowing the Communist Party leadership, not not not patriotic,' and added the words 'according to the words' that Ge Pei Qi 'has spoken out certain truths and speaks the hearts of the people's masses. The day after the fallacy of the 'party world' was published, Chen Dingsha He wrote the article 'I am the party', proving the correctness of the fallacy of Chu Anping; organized a report for Yao Dengfo, a general general of the NLD right group Sun Jiaxu and Xubu Union, to support Yao in public slander, 'Communist Party members are plainclothes police, and the Communist Party should leave school.' Party Speech. \\nThe masses were extremely outraged at these right-wing elements and expressed their determination to fight them in the end, not to win all, and never recruit soldiers.

				"memoirContent": "[Attached] Qian xiguang Xiguang: 'Political Stations and Academic Opinions Should Be Distinguished, Let Go Criticizing Policy Law-Speech at the May 31st Meeting of Political and Law Colloquium held by Beijing Branch of Jiusan Society'\\n(1), Prerequisite: in legal research should be particularly good at distinguishing between political and academic views. Because (1), law and law have a strong class character and are closely linked to politics, within the legal leadership, academic views are most easily mixed with political positions. (2), The arbitrary effect of the reform of the Department has not been eliminated, the old jurist is the bird of the bow, and the new jurists still look at people in another eye. Before Chairman Mao's two speeches, old jurists did not dare to sound, afraid that, like the reform of the Division, any issues are mentioned in the standpoint, and put a hat on them. In order to express their firm position and correct views, the new jurists cannot use Marxinist legal theories to analyze actual material and independently think and research problems, thus forming a serious dogmist tendency. This is the main reason for the current backwardness of legal research. \\nIn order to change the backwardness of legal research, it is necessary to implement the policy of one hundred people under the premise of a strict distinction between political and academic views. How to implement?-Not only can academic opinions be contested, but policy laws can also be commented on. At a seminar on political and law work held by the Institute of Political Science and Law, Comrade Wu Defeng said he could comment on policy. It is hoped that the party and the government will study how to make it a long-term approach. The benefits of doing this are unpredictable, and I think of a few main benefits are:\\n(1), The motivation of jurists can be encouraged: when the research work of scholars can produce practical effects for the welfare of the citizens, their motivation is conceivable. \\n(2), It can help governments to identify policy and legal problems and overcome subjectivity and bureaucracy. \\n(3), Legislation could be improved. \\nAs in the Soviet legal community during the popular period of personal worship, jurists had to recite dogmas, and people were in the cloud. After the twenty party congresses, the situation has basically changed and the legal profession has become active. A number of recommendations and suggestions were made that would contribute to strengthening the rule of law and conducting legal research. Such as Mo Mikhailov 'Some Issues in the Practice of the Soviet Constitution' (Study Series, February 1957, Russian September 1956), presented a systematic opinion on the revision of the Constitution of the Soviet Union and the improvement of the state system, which we have not seen in the past. \\nOur critical study of policy laws can look into the laws that have been enacted. The Rule of Law Bureau is currently undergoing the process of finalizing administrative regulations. Could the scope be expanded to include all decrees that have been enacted. And to develop the internal collation into open discussion in society, allowing all new and old jurists to participate. Or first study a few major laws. Comments can be made on which laws to be amended, how to amend, what laws should be enacted to implement the Constitution, etc. In my preliminary view, the Marriage Act may be amended or implementing legislation, or setting out Chapter 4 relations between parents and children in more detail according to the current situation of abusive abandonment. For example, the question of the criteria for divorce in chapter 5 should be set out. Former article 17 was very unclear and technically flawed. As in article 97 of the Constitution, 'Citizens of the People's Republic of China have the political advantage of lodged a written complaint or oral complaint to state organs at all levels against any staff member of the State organ who has failed to act in violation of the law. In order to give effect to this provision, laws shall be enacted in order to implement this article on persons who have suffered damage as a result of violations of civil rights by agents of State organs, the right to compensation', which is of great significance for resolving internal conflicts among the people and in close relations between the people and the Government. \\n(2), legal cadres. \\nFor old jurists, do not look at them in a constant point of view, but from the point of view of historical materialism. In this way, they can be equitably valued, their potential strength can be used, unites them well, and through academic studies to overcome old ideas of law, increase the Marxist view and gradually transform an old law scholar into a Marxist jurist. \\nFor the new law cadres who really train, properly use it, it is not an abusive charge (student source), (the original intention of the money is to say: such as Renmin University students are mostly workers and farmers cadres who transfer to study, I heard that some people have difficulty even attending written tests, so you should pay attention to student source-Editor's Note), and abuse of cadres (assigning work), Ministry of Higher Education), (Money intended to say: once seen in the report, the Ministry of Higher Education allocated among graduates , Law graduates, many use non-learning-editorial notes), or Miao fueled (people's congresses and dry schools), (money originally said: teachers who do not have enough lecture conditions also make lectures hard. People's University and Central School of Political Science and Law are all like this-Editor's Note), eager to achieve it. To take the law seriously as a science, it is not enough to deal with legal issues from a political standpoint. Scientific knowledge is still indispensable. \\n(3), Research institutions and book material issues. \\nIt was not cumbersome in favour of the Institute of Urgency Legislation to adapt to the task of strengthening the rule of law. It is proposed to set up a law library. \\nLack of information: domestic data Yes-sleeping there. Master the information will not write articles, will write articles can not touch the data. No data abroad-there are few social science books in international bookstores, especially in law, and virtually no doctrine of capitalist law. English literature is full of eyes, and Hobbs's Liviathan waited months to buy one. \\nAs a result, it would be difficult for women to be rice free, and everyone (especially non-party writers), had to be limited to studying the history of the rule of law. The lack of information is a serious impediment to the development of legal research. The establishment of a law library was recommended. The purchase of all new national legal books and various legal journals now published on the basis of the Library of the Rule of Law Bureau, the former Library of the Political Society (AIPJ), and the Library of the Institute of Political Science and Law, should also be placed in the international bookshop. \\n(Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Institute of Law Library provides a collection of myths of right-wing political and legal circles Law Press, 1957)\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 2"

Whenever I go here, I can't help but recall one of my early years, Mr. Chin Yin-wing (Tian Yu, 1910-1971). Mr. Yin Rong was born of Taian Shu Xiang family-his grandfather for the late Qing poet, former Honglung Temple orderly class Mr. Qian Yin-bin (Jingfu, 1851-1928)-Qian teacher from a young child to learn, deeply educated, and teach in the village before the war, pay attention to scientific knowledge, respect for the post-school.

Yam Wing is versatile and often choreographed some small operas or live drama outside of teaching to lead us around. Qian also talked to me many times that to be a qualified teacher, he would lecture and publicize-it was inspired and induced by Yam Rong that I became an active activist in the academic circles and academic circles by a shy teenager. \\nIn the fight against the right, Yin Rongji was misrepresented on the right, and died of persecution in the Cultural Revolution. Because I was also trapped in a cattle shed, the Xie Shi of the enshi could not spawn, but to look away from Dai Ling, swallow. For many years I have tried to return the teachings of the first teacher, but because the deceased has not been able to make up, I feel sorry in my heart. Two years ago, due to a chance, I was delighted to learn that Zhou Yijun was the grandson of the first teacher! Interaction with Zhou Yi realized my desire to pursue the forerunner. It is his ancestors poetry and ritual, since childhood opened the heart of Zhou, coupled with his own diligence to learn, finally achieved outstanding academic achievements, Shishima family, origins. Today I read this book of Zhou Yi, not only have a deeper understanding of Xiao Tycoon this evening, but I would like to take this opportunity to make a slightly statement with Zhou Junzhu, in order to express my deep remembrance of the foreman and the unrivaled satisfaction of Zhou's ancestors, not to fall. \\nLuo Chenglie, July 1999, Qufu Normal University"

				"memoirContent": "【Attached】Qian yi: 'Participating in the revolution is my biggest lucky' (book book)\\nI was born to a poor family in Wujiang. After I graduated from primary school, I was studying at the then public education center. As the pace of Japanese aggression has accelerated, Wujiang regions have fallen successively, suffering the relentless trampling by the Japanese invading forces. \\nIn 1942, it was the inflection point of my life and the starting point of my revolution. \\nWhen I was 17 years old, I remember one day when a female teacher came to the education hall and didn't think she changed the fate of my life. She is a Japanese student who speaks fluent in Japanese and Mandarin, and she cannot fail her with any musical instruments. The classmates adore her very much. While teaching us Japanese, she will tell us about the situation and stories of the Kuomintang and Communist Party from time to time. The longer you get into contact with her, the more you will be attracted to her. Gradually, I knew she was taking advantage of her class to buy a horse for the Communist Party. \\nYou know, in old society, good men are not soldiers. However, the country flourished, Pi Fu was responsible, and I followed the teacher along with 23 students to Yixing Zhangzhu, to become an underground worker, and since then embarked on the road of revolution. To participate in the revolution, I talked with my peers to change the name. Considering that Chen Yi has always been my idol, I changed the name Qian Runsheng to Qian yi. \\nAt the beginning of Zhangzhu, Zhang Zhu has not been occupied by Japan. In addition to studying and working every day, occasionally teachers will let me take responsibility for sending some letters. Around the Beijing-Shanghai Railway from Nanjing to Shanghai, there are a lot of underground workers stronghold; Japanese soldiers were also patrolling a lot, but at that time they were not very strict supervision of ordinary people, especially children. Remember when I sent the first letter, I saw the Japanese soldiers, and I walked away from them with my head and nervously, but I was not stopped by them for questioning. Gradually, my courage grew up. In 3 years, there was never a problem when sending the letter. \\nIn 1945, I joined the New Four Forces and became a veritable revolutionary warrior. \\nRemember that the troops just entered, in order to prevent the enemy forces from attacking, everyone has to take turns every night, and I am no exception. A shift from zero to two o'clock in the morning is the most difficult, sometimes carrying a gun can doze. In winter, the temperature is particularly low at night, everyone is often cold straight shiver, can only run back and forth to heat. \\nI was lucky. Compared to comrades, such a standing experience I did not have a few times. Because in the army, many comrades are illiterate and don't know a big word. Although I am a primary school graduate, I am also a little intellectuals. Comrades received or responded to letters, are willing to come to me, I am happy to help them read letters and write letters. As compensation, they helped me get up. \\nDuring this time, I felt not only friendship, but more of a strong affection. Since approaching 200 miles a day, I grew a blood-bubble on my feet, but still had to bite my teeth, and I couldn't affect the collective because of myself. The deputy chief found this incident, every night to give me hot water, and then use a needle to help me pick up the blood bubble one by one, wipe on the ointment. \\nWith such leaders and comrades, can the troops ununited? Later, when the instructor discovered that I was a bit of culture, the record staff at the class session became me. I didn't expect that, six months later, I went to the battalion communications class and became a correspondent. \\nLater, I was a telephone clerk at the Mission Department, and the fighting broke out in Xuanjiapu. The left and right rooms at the duty station were dormitories and mule rings used to drag the telephone line. The air is full of powder smell, guns and ammunition firing each other, deafening. As a telephone clerk, I don't stop for a moment, contact my superiors, understand the war... affected by the combat, the phone is disconnected. The sound of the bomb explodes sounded in the ear and I was only nervous to pick up the phone. Suddenly, a bomb exploded in Westinghouse, the west wall collapsed, side by side down the sea towards me, the mule died, and I became unconscious. \\nBy choosing a revolution, it means always choosing to give up life. Indeed, my first battle was in Yixing Dingshan. At that time, Japan had a small unit and a company of pseudo-army troops. We ambush on the side of the road, there is a bunker on the road, we can see machine guns stretching out from the bunker. To cross the road to reach the village in front, you must regain this bunker. A comrade in charge, wanted to fire a machine gun with his own life, to help us cross the road safely, but he sacrificed heroic. At this time, the instructor ordered me to collect the remains for him. As a soldier, obedience is a duty to obey orders. Even though I know that it is dead, I will also rush forward. Brain, under the cover of the guns of my comrades, I picked up the pens of the ship as cover to climb on the road. 100 meters, 50 meters, 20 meters... near, still frightened, I successfully 'grab' back from the gun and bomb rain. But Penny is full of bullet holes. So far, I still have a lot of thought to think of this. \\nThe brutal war and the dire situation of struggle do not allow us to relax and slay at all. Immediately after Japan surrendered, we went to the war of liberation and moved to the battlefield of Shandong. Remember once, on the battlefield of the Huaihai Battle, around the corpses, bloody, after the gun was exhausted, we staged the bayonets with the Kuomintang. Whistling, bayonet collision is always in the ear. My left arm was stabbed by the enemy, and with strong faith, we won the war. One more time, I hit a stray bullet. Well, it was winter, wearing a thick padded jacket. Only half of the bullets fell into my thighs. They are the testimony of my revolution, reminding me of my unforgettable years. \\nIn 1952, I graduated from the army and returned to Wujiang, and the Sunan Culture and Education Department uniformly assigned me to the Daxin Blessing Center Elementary School. \\nIn 1958, in the big magnification, I was called the 'right', devolved to rural labor, 'transformation' was 18 years. Remember a year on New Year's Eve, snowflakes flooded outside, and everyone was eating reunion rice at home. At this point, the village leader informed me to drag the reed. Just walked outside, the cold winds blow in front, I shivered a bit, wrapped in a padded jacket, immediately put into work. In the snow and ice, the already flooded reed reeds were dragged so heavy until the 3,000 bales of reeds were filled and dragged tired back home, almost 1:00 a.m. \\nIt can be said that I have experienced special periods such as the war of resistance against Japan, the war of liberation, the struggle against the right to the 'Cultural Revolution', and witnessed the transformation of a person and a country from confusion and struggle to progress. A bitter effort. In 1979, I once again stood on the three-foot podium and saw the students, and I felt I didn't go far with them. In 1985, after leaving, I enjoyed playing chess, singing, reading newspapers. \\nI have always considered myself a lucky man of the revolution, with 24 fellow countrymen participating in the revolution, leaving only three; although I was decentralised, 18 years of rural labor exercise my body. Now, don't look at me in my 80s, but eyes do not spend, ears are not deaf, the days are more comfortable. (The author is Zhangjiagang city retired cadres)"

Money originated from a landlord class family, the sense of exploitation was extremely serious. At the time of university, it was decided to rely on Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang for power and money. After joining the Reactionary Sanqing League in 1943, he was satisfied that 'the principal and head of the team are Chiang Kai-shek, and they can eat in the future.' (Formerly: Chiang Kai-shek is the Pseudo-CUHK Principal and Head of the Samqing Since then, Money began a series of criminal anti-party activities against the people. \\nIn 1944, Qian zhicheng was teaching director in Pengxian simple teacher teacher, at a time when local farmers had a movement. Money had asked the pseudo county governor to send troops to suppress, causing the peasant movement to fail. Peasants were killed and injured by two or 300 people. In the event of an emergency, money and harboured their father-in-law, and robe bullies in their homes. \\nIn 1948, Qian zhicheng was the director of the training director of the Minming Puiwen Secondary School, collusion with KMT agent leader Mao Jia (Principal), to persecut students. He had worked with Mao Jia to catch Communist Party members in student dormitories and frequently raided students' dormitories and turned the cage down. In order to ask agents for their work, the money stood at the entrance of the school before 8:00 a.m., and the students were searched. Under this fascist rule, the whole school students are all over the day without fear, and the money is forgettable, claiming that the 'Communist Party' 'does not enter the literature'. \\nAfter liberation, the moneyclass position remains unchanged. Disobeying distribution when participating in the land reform, resisting the leadership, insulting party members at work, provoking party relations, often slipping out of work, and committing many serious mistakes, such as misdrawing class components, activism in combating poor farmers, compassion to wealthy, leaking secret land reform secrets, causing great losses to work. Money's participation in the land reform work is only to cover up its reactionary face. \\nMoney reactionary class revenge sentiment is deeply rooted. In 1950, money concealed history mixed into the NLD, with the intention of finding an organization's relationship stealth, standby again. After the organization found out, in 1951 to stop its alliances, money conspiracy defeated, hateful threat: 'two days old Zi gain momentum, not kill you a few!' Money has defamed every measure of the people's government since liberation, and has undermined the resistance to teaching reform. It was also extremely hostile to the Soviet Union, saying that the Soviet Union 'moved the machine in the northeast' and 'was imperialist.' \\nQian zhicheng Zhicheng is not always hostile to the Party and socialism, and is a political rogue scammer. In the early days of liberation, forced by the situation, once claimed to be grateful for the leniency of the Party and the people, and to work hard for socialism. But there was still hostility towards the new society. After the reform of the land reform and the ideology, they all made similar confessions, and later proved to be a lie, put it back in rebellion, thanked the Party and the government for leniency, saying what 'is determined to wear guilt and reward the party and the people', pretending repentance to deceive the organization, and in fact to carry out a conspiracy for class restoration. When the bourgeoisie right-wing rampant offensive against the party this year, the money thinks that the time has come to leap out, and become a pioneer in advancing government towards the Party and the people. \\nMoney endorses the fallacy of the 'party world' of Chuanping. Advocating that the Party withdraw from the school, be managed by 'professors', and slander the Party Committee, saying: 'The Party Committee is Yamen' and 'the Party Committee is Yan Luo Temple'. School leaders and comrades of party members at all levels were litigated. The money has attacked and negated the socialist democratic centralization system, the Party's cadre policy, the socialist personnel system and the achievements of socialism. For example, 'with the personnel system, evil will rise'; 'teachers who raise salaries are all linked with relatives and uncle'. Money openly threatened during a crazy attack: 'Under the socialist system, everything is not democratic'. And said, 'I think that old system was good'. At this point, the purpose of the criminal activities of money, which has always sought to overthrow socialism and revive reactionary rule, has been revealed. \\nMoney Weekday performance has always been bad, set of rogue scammers. When it came to the cloud, he lied to be robbed and cheated cloud travel expenses. Before and after liberation, innocent women were raped. Weekdays always provoke the right and wrong, undermine unity, crack down on the leadership, and make a slight attempt to recklessly abusive, and the impact is extremely bad. \\nMoney in the big magnification, happy, around activities, performance is extremely crazy. At the beginning of the liberation, Qian zhicheng immediately sent a letter to the Yunnan Daily to attack the Party and Yunda leaders. He did not see it out, and wrote a letter to criticize the Yunnan Daily for 'sectarianism'. Why did he not register his letter and coerced the Yunnan Daily to reply publicly. Money at various symposia, rampant to attack the party. In the colloquium held by the Provincial Sports Committee, speeches for several hours, and made great efforts to defame the attack. In the early days of the revelation, money often wandered in front of the 'democratic wall' full of poisonous grass, saying, 'This is the end of the Communist Party, these king eight bulbs should be complete.' The ambition of its sons is well known. After the fight against the right began, money left school due to events, knowing that he was guilty and defeated, and in order to escape the masses struggle, delayed the return for a long time. But the right-wing elements are hard to escape the people's networks, and the anti-socialist right-wing elements of the anti-socialist, too, can't escape the masses of the people.

He also added in his essay, 'Mr. Sung Shue Sung said that professors are the system of capitalist countries and that professors are the bourgeois ideology. 'I say no matter, though professor is something in capitalist countries, as long as it is good, it can be adopted.' He also said that the party was not selfless and that defaming the party did not treat people equally.

He said: 'The school is very harsh on sports teachers. I have been a lecturer for eight or nine years, upgraded lower than me, and it is very harsh for us, so I can't afford to pay professor for four reasons: (1), I was unfortunate to be a sports teacher; (2), a non-party person; (3), no kinship at school; (4), I At Yunnan University, Yunnan University has a tradition of looking down on physical education teachers. \\nHe slandered the school: 'We feel that our school is a sectarianism, all factions are also sectarian, for the sake of their own sectarian, completely regardless of the interests of the masses', 'schools like Jia Fu, Inch Tree and other democratic people are big girl and two girls. People like us are four or five.' \\nHe spoke out at all school units and leaders at all levels, such as the General Affairs Office, Personnel Department, Personnel Section, Party Committee, Registrations Committee, Education Section, Health Section...

				"memoirContent": "【Attached】'Big Communiqué': 'Wuxi Business and Commerce Stripped Zhong Han Jinxiu Outerwear' (September 18, 1957, 'Big Communiqué')\\nThis spring, there was a person in Wuxi City who called himself 'Song Shijie', who set fire everywhere and encouraged the business community to 'spit bitter water'. Nowadays, the counterfeit Song Shijie was stripped of a splendid jacket under the siege of the business community in Wuxi City, revealing its original shape as a reactionary politician and a political gambling stick. \\nThis person is Qian zhonghan, Vice Mayor of Wuxi City, the Central Committee of the Civil Construction Committee, and the principal of the Municipal Business School of Political Science and Industry. Is the son of Qian Sunqing, a veteran bourgeois, a veteran of Jiangsu Province. Before liberation, some people called Qian Zhong-han for the so-called 'provincial senator' when he was called a 'home-learning origin'. This sentence was indeed right. Qian Sun-qing, a veteran right-wing activist, has given Qian zhonghan's ear training to Qian Zhong-han, making Qian Zhong-han always wanted to inherit his father's mantle in Wuxi After liberation, the father and son double stop, also dry many reactionary hook. For example, when the government issued Victory Bond in 1950, this pair of fathers and sons made a two-stone approach. Instruction that Hsiao Zonghan, a right-wing activist in the business and industry, must make the cotton spinning and flour industries in the business world account for cheap. Qian zhonghan also personally came forward, forcing the then Municipal Joint Preparatory Committee for Industry and Commerce to adopt a consultative plan, so that the cotton textile industry, which accounted for 70 per cent of the total capital of the city's industrial and commercial enterprises, had subscribed only 23 per cent of the total public debt. The flour industry, which accounts for more than 7% of the total capital of the city's industrial and commercial enterprises, only subscribed 3.25% of the total public debt, More than 70 per cent of total public debt is allocated to small and medium-sized industries. After the fact, the father and son of the Qian family pretended to represent the opinion of small and medium-sized businessmen and said to the party and the government: 'The business community is overburdened with public debt. To make small and medium-sized businessmen of unknown truth complain about the government, mistakenly believing that Qian's father and son represented the interests of the business community. The father and son of Qian both kept hypocritical face and achieved anti-socialist goals. Finally, the task of making the city subscribe to public debt was not completed. In May of this year, the father and son sang one and one, Qian Sunqing said in Nanjing: 'The private party will run a factory, and a factory is better than looking at who.' Qian zhonghan immediately said in Wuxi, 'Shenxin textile factory may wish to try.' He also slandered the public representative system and said: 'The public and private parties are generally like Buddha, and are as defensive as thieves.' After the publication of this fallacy, it once caused confusion in the business community in Wuxi. \\nQian Zhong-han officially suspended Song Shijie's signboard, also in May this year. He spoke at the third closing ceremony of the Municipal Business Political School on the pretext of helping the party to rectify the wind and ignite the flames. He said to the trainees of the business community who participated in the study: 'Everyone can make personal demands, spit up five bitter waters. If someone crashes against retaliation, I am willing to be Song Shijie, and for you.' And tell you the three phone numbers of your office and residence. \\nThis poisonous flame stirred the Wuxi city's business community into a pandemonium. \\nAfter a student in the hotel industry listened to Qian Zhong-han, immediately wrote to him, saying, 'How warm I feel like listening to your report, I hope you can do Song Shijie.' Qian zhonghan immediately replied and gave encouragement, saying, 'This issue does not require me to come out to do Song Shijie,' suggesting that he was yelling at the grassroots level. The private sector has been demanding wage increases everywhere. \\nIt also happens in the bathroom industry, photo industry, catering industry. Some members of the private sector have come back from the Political School of Business and Industry to professional companies and trade associations to make many unreasonable demands: to increase wages, call for reversed accounts, etc., and so on. The company's manager, chief of section and they said, 'You are all bureaucratic, and we have rich deputy mayors.' And threatened to withdraw from public-private partnerships if they were not addressed. \\nIn public-private dairy farms, the countercurrent of capitalism is even more dramatic. A trainee who graduated from the Political School of Business and Industry cried out of the public-private partnership was unreasonable when he returned, and he wanted to quit the joint venture, and incited other private personnel in the field, saying: 'There is a problem ministry can raise it, and rich deputy mayor Song Shijie is the backbone.' There were then seven private individuals requesting written requests to withdraw from the joint venture, some to withdraw advances from the shareholders already approved in the funds, to repay the private debt and overthrow agreements on wages after the climax. \\nQian Zhong-han, this counterfeit Song Shijie is hesitant and forgettable, the powerful anti-right struggle began. From August 27, Wuxi business and industry rally continuously to fight against him. More than a week at the meeting, 101 business and businessmen attended and 98 speakers. There were 152 people who exposed and refuted Qian Zhong Han's reactionary remarks and deeds. Reasoning struggles will receive a total of 336 statements, statements of resolve and expose materials from all sides of the business community. Many people who have been pulled by him and used by him in the past And also gradually come sober, and he draw the boundaries and fight face to face. In a reasoning struggle, he did not admit the fact that there was a bribe, and those who had been used by him immediately stood up and said, 'I am a witness, you still have to be cunning.' Qian Zhong Han had to lower his head. \\nQian zhonghan's anti-socialist crimes against the party for seven and eight years have been difficult to book. But he has always smeared and disguised progress. He repeatedly boasted to the business community that he was 'half a Communist Party member,' he said: 'According to my thoughts and abilities, it is quite enough to be a Communist Party member, only because my status is not a member of the Communist Party.' Many people in the industry and industry in Wuxi had been confused by him. On the contrary, he said to some businessmen that as long as a 'crying out' look, you can pass through the customs. In this anti-right struggle, Qian Zhong-han, even if he pretended to cry out the look, he could not be confused. \\nWuxi movie theaters are releasing the film 'Song Shijie' this two days, which may be a coincidence and an irony. Peking opera performing artist Zhou Xinfang's artistic creation, carved out the image of Song Shijie, a well-deserved and unequal love, won the audience warmly appreciated. What about Qian Zhong-Han, who calls himself as Song Shijie in Wuxi City? He has yet to fully account for his anti-party crimes against the people. At the end of the streets, people are arguing: 'Stink!' \\nOn the afternoon of September 14, more than 2,000 businessmen and businessmen in Wuxi city rallied to criticize the money Zhong Han, debunking on the spot that he used to obstruct the struggle by dragging people into water and other means, trying to confuse the border. Businessmen in the city are determined to fight against this bourgeois reactionary politician to completely eliminate the influence of Sun Qing and Qian zhonghan's father and son in Wuxi for decades.

				"memoirContent": "[Attached] Tongji University Marxinism Library: A Compilation of the Words of the Right Party Qian zhongyi (1957.10)\\nI. Leader of the opposition, stigmatization of the party and activists\\n'Now the Communist Party is not a problem of the trialism, it is not a question of lack of ability to lead.' \\n'Liu Shaoqi's political report at the Eighth Congress is not good. If it is difficult to come up with a solution, if it is not available, the government is not entitled to exist again.' \\nWhen discussing the issue of Chairman Mao's report on the food and five people eating by three people, Qian proposed 'to reclaim the waste,' and said: 'The Communist Party is the ruling party. If there is no way to solve these problems, it should step down. The party cannot fall.' 'Communist Party, Bastard'! \\nHe strongly favoured the introduction of professors in higher schools, and the opposition party committee directly led the administration. He said: 'So the party committee becomes the executive emperor.' \\n'Turning to the leadership of the Party, I think that the Party needs to have principled leadership and to have concrete leadership. Now it is a reflection of the fact that the Party has not led this way. Now, the newspaper says, don't kill a stick. I think it's hard to be a matter of leadership, not a problem of style, and now the principal is hard to do it. Is a bad style. My thoughts are reflected in my view of the problems with teaching and teaching plans. Zhang Yunting (Party General Secretary), wants to lead me, my teaching plan came out, and he scared away in a few words.' \\nHe said: 'I find a new group of exploiters who are in a very high leadership position, do not learn without skills, do not work with money, do not work enough, and lose more than anything. There are too many people to eat by virtue now.' \\n'The party has a lot of merit in the revolution, and how to arrange the position is a question. If the party does not absorb experts or become experts themselves, then the business cannot lead...'\\n'Communist Party members, very organized, but also very blind, always knew only the intent of implementing the leadership. What is Leadership Intent? Is it always right to lead this? 'They don't think independently at all, and our school's political leadership and business leaders have increased.' \\n'There should be no secrets within the Party. The Party is representative of the interests of the people. If it truly represents the interests of the people, there is no need to fear the people.' \\n'The question of whether the Party Committee wants... is actually the question of who the Party Committee is responsible. I think the Party Committee is responsible for the party members, and the municipal committee is responsible.' \\n'There is no subjectivity so bureaucracy is serious, no subjective is bureaucracy.' \\n'The phrase 'make less or not make principled mistakes' is bad, only those who do not do things.' \\n'The party used to be materialism prevailed, and now it is idealism prevailed.' \\n'People's Daily editorial workers spoke, this is a blind talk that is unwilling to facts, listen to × × say that a lot of Shanghai workers have made trouble petitions earlier, who actually represents the workers.' \\n'The current party is the ruling party, has mastered the propaganda body, and rebuttal criticism if there is a problem, this role is extremely bad.' (Abstract of Qian Chung Yi's reactionary remarks)\\nAttempted to seize the full power in the department, saying, 'What I want is full power, otherwise I don't have to show up.' \\n'The Yugoslav lady believes that direct party leadership in production is the root cause of bureaucracy. I think it is very bureaucratic, at least, to lead without acting.' \\n'There are now many accusations of private individuals in public-private joint ventures of disobedience to public representatives. I think it is not an issue of disobedience, but a question of capacity. If the official representative can quickly master the business, it is natural for people to serve.' \\n'There are no people who rent to open stores now, and direct forms of exploitation are gone. However, there is a form of indirect exploitation-parasitism under the regime, the Communist Party packs people down, holding a position mixed, unintentionally, and sharing the fruits of labor as such-'who are born and the eaters are wideless'. Overall production efficiency is extremely difficult to improve, and the production enthusiasm of workers is difficult to improve further.' \\n'The history of all (some), democrats are known to be ugly without revealing. The old society can become famous people and have not been killed by Chiang Kai-shek, must not be too clean, and if there is no certain name in the old society, it will not be treated as democrats after liberation.' 'The Communist Party raised the blood and sweat of the working people a group of democrats for themselves. Ken played a certain positive role when speaking of a certain positive role, when not scolded to a worthless money, aged dormitories turned up.' \\n'(The Party believes), to take the masses route is the most rare talent. Now it is often said that as long as you go the masses line, you can lead it well. It seems like taking the masses route such a rare talent, as long as you go, you can have.' 'Turtles are always turtles, rabbits are always rabbits. Bunnies may sleep, turtles can not always catch up. Walking the masses route is also albinism.' \\nWhen the newspaper revealed the thickness of the party's treatment of certain right-wing elements after liberation, he said: 'The treatment given by the party to these people is superficial, and the party should be responsible.' \\nWhen the newspaper refuted the claim that 'there is no right' and exposes the ambition of right-wing elements to usurp the party's leadership, he raised a 'duty and no responsibility' and said: 'It is not powerless, but because the system is not clear, responsibilities are not clear, and public officials can do whatever they want to do, can also 'scalper' for a day. Cut to push and push.' \\n'The four sets of leadership cadres in the business departments of the party, government, industry, and regiment, there are too few direct production people.' \\n'Collective leadership is a good excuse for executive leaders not to be accountable.' Describe those who obey the party leaders as 'cattle without shoulders.' \\n'Don't be anxious as soon as you hear not the party committee. The problem is how the party plays a leadership role.' 'The separation of party and government dignitaries is the executive not party leadership.' \\n'Party members are too organized and too poor to think independently. Can not wait for the superior arrangement, according to their own experience of the party platform and constitution, direct action?' \\n'The leader of the opener party, the leader of the closed party, is the best amulet for scalpers.' \\n'In the administrative system, there is also the party's great emperor.' \\nAt a panel meeting, a comrade said that Secretary Hu said that the North University's Democratic Wall was right, it was still worth studying. He is not in favour of such an approach and is willing to check in the future if his decision (opinion), is wrong. And the money said: 'It's not the superiors right yet, and the supervisor will review it wrong. What is the meaning of such an ordered review?' (Qian zhongyi Check 2)\\nII. Stigmatization of the wind, liberation and anti-right struggle\\n(A), defamation of the wind\\n'The whole wind can only solve some chickens and garlic skin, the fundamental problem is not solved.' It is not in favor of the Party's proposed wind and rain, saying: 'Some kind of people hit ten sticks will not die, and some people die as soon as they touch and kill, for example, I am not afraid to fight, even though it was done.' \\n'It is not a matter of style, but a problem of ability.' (Qian zhongyi Check 2)\\n'The party's reckoning can only improve some minor problems, the fundamental problem cannot be solved. Unless achievements are reassessed, there is a fundamental change in some systems.' \\n'This is different from the last time. Now the party is the ruling party, the bureaucracy of the ruling party is uncompromising, the ruling party must be proud of complacency...' ('Qian zhongyi reactionary remarks summary')\\n(2), slander\\n'The Central Committee calls on everyone to shine. This is the emperor whipped by Lee's wife after the wife gave to the Bai, and the pretense is finally not daring to beat the small emperor (than dare not to give a fundamental opinion to the party leader), because if the small emperor is beaten, it can then ask her wife to withdraw the whipped queen to kill him.' \\nWhen it came to light, he incited, 'I am now mixed up with a second-class professor, even if it is. How do you guys do I don't care.' \\n'The political interests of students are narrow, and there will only be some personal stigmatization and attacks, and the political air is too bad and not hard enough.' (Qian zhongyi Check 2)\\n(3), Stigmatization of anti-right struggle\\n'This is an absolutely accurate approach to the Communist Party's assertion that it will be tentative for seven years and, if necessary, can be extended in the future. Li Kangnian said that 20 years of fixed interest would be the right. What about a fixed rate of seven years and one day is left and right? Eight years is left right? 'What is the dividing line of years?' \\nWhen the newspaper revealed the thickness of the party for some right-wing elements after liberation, he said: 'The right is condoned by the party.' \\nWhen the newspaper refuted the arguments of the right, he also spread the theory of 'no total negation'. 'A false argument may be that the underlying argument is wrong, but it is never possible that all the arguments are wrong. The whole false argument, do not attack itself, no fight against the right heroes flourish. If criticizing Hu Shi, hard to say 'bold doubt, carefully seeking proof, 'is meticulous, I think some of these two sentences are good, completely scientific... All arguments put forward in order to criticize Hu Shi are negated, but not convincing.' \\nWhen Sun Heavy Rain was published in the newspaper to stigmatize the counterrevolution, Fudan Party Committee warned Sun that he would prosecute according to the law. Qian said: 'When the three countermeasures counter counter, I was bravely doubting, criticizing the idea of methods, but I was using the law to crush people.' \\n'Many of the things that the right party claims are right and have to do less in the future, only because others have raised it, the Communist Party will be hard to deny it.' \\nAfter Chairman Mao presented the six-standard report, he said: 'Chairman Mao said that critical mistakes should not be dogmatic, metaphysical methods, dialectical methods and scientific analysis. What kind of criticism is dogmatic, metaphysical, and how is it a dialectical scientific analysis? Is there a dogmatic, metaphysical phenomenon in the criticism of counteracting the right now? Chairman Mao will not raise this issue without targeting.' \\n'It is now the time of movement, melee, stray powder fly, stretched out to suffer from an unarrogant catastrophe, has no positive meaning and cannot be brave. When a little calm, the wind turns into a positive and constructive time, and then speak well (refers to public official speech). \\n'As long as I don't speak in public, they can't catch my dreadlocks.' \\nWhen Comrade did the anti-right report, he said, 'Chairman Mao is afraid to see the right.' (Qian Zhong Yi Check)\\n'The right line is hard to draw, see that he (refers to the party), willing to draw there right there.' \\n'The anti-right is a manifestation of the party's lack of strength and confidence, and anti-right activists are dog legs.' \\n'My anti-right struggle is a formula of criticism-tolerance-unity, and the party is tolerant of those who are useful. '(Summary of reactionary remarks by Qian zhongyi)\\nThird, stigmatization is a policy error\\n'The fight against Hufeng anti-revolutionary group, against some people, in fact, violates human rights, separates people and struggles, says help, it is illegal.' \\n'Party organizations at all levels should not use instructions to violate human rights.' (Abstract of Qian Chung Yi's reactionary remarks)\\nFourth, against the proletarian dictatorship\\n'The current system cannot be considered to be the best proletarian dictatorship, and it cannot be assumed that changing the current system will be no proletarian dictatorship.' \\n'Proletarian dictatorship is a hint of dictatorship, while bourgeoisie dictatorship is a clothed dictatorship.' (meaning that the bourgeois dictatorship can be seen), ('Qian zhongyi reactionary remarks summary')\\nV. Stigma workers and farmers and oppose the policy of higher education to workers and farmers\\n'The question of helicopter is directly related to the future of speed secondary students, and they strive for it to be natural. College students have entered college, and the rising up of speed high school students has nothing to do with them (college students), why would they all be noisy?' (Hint that this is just outrage). (Qian zhongyi Check 2)\\nVI. Stigma Marxism and political workers against theoretical learning\\n'The percentage of the total hours of political classes is too high.' When comrades raised the question of the effectiveness of the political class as a matter of teaching methods, he said: 'If there is always a problem with the method of something, it must be doubtful if it is itself problematic.' \\n'The philosophical debate is a matter of rank, and to debate with people, it is necessary to quote classic writings.' \\n'University students should know to be responsible for their actions,' said in a symposium on students against political examinations. If I was convinced that the class was unnecessary, I would dare to come out of the department with a certificate of lack of this score.' (Qian zhongyi Check 2)\\n'Dialectical materialism has nothing to learn, all day in a few nouns circles, drill the horn tip, and vice versa, is always unclear, learned useless.' \\n'In the past, church schools read the Bible, the party's ideology, and now learn Marxism-Leninism, are all just as annoying and ineffective. It is recommended that students do not have to learn Marxism.' \\n'Stand plus machinery, materialism is a mess.' (Abstract of Qian Chung Yi's reactionary remarks)\\n7. Oppose our foreign policy, stigmatize socialist countries and promote capitalism\\nHe did not value the expert's speeches and refused to personally ask for expert speeches, saying: 'Now take the facade and make content for the paper basket.' 'It is not enough for experts to spend so much time writing handouts. As long as two or three yuan to buy this Soviet textbook, you can get teaching materials produced by the greater specialization of the Soviet Union.' Stigmatization of Soviet experts is 'stupid' and 'old man'. \\n'The mistakes of Stalin, Lakosi, Gro, etc., are fueled by dictatorship.' \\n'The Hungarians should be allowed to choose themselves, and the Soviet army is to interfere in internal affairs.' \\n'A great communist like Stalin can also make mistakes in the late stages, because he holds a personal expression of the interests of the proletarian regime and the masses. It is visible that materialists have become mentalists because they are satisfied with past achievements.' (Qian zhongyi Check 2)\\n'The Soviet Union sending troops to Hungary is hard to interfere. The proletariat cannot lead, let the bourgeois lead. They should be allowed to fight within themselves. The Soviet Union should not intervene, and the victories of the counter-revolutionary forces will continue to persist.' \\n'Now Hungary's Qadar government is also a bastard, and after he came to power, he is still dictatorship, without democracy.' \\n'Lenin said that the revolution cannot be exported, and now the Soviet Union is sending troops to Hungary, which is a guise.' \\nSold: 'Sadovich (Soviet expert), is a foreign liar, will only brag, come to China to take China's money and build merit for themselves.' \\n'The opinions of Soviet experts cannot be combined with the actual Chinese reality, nor are those who study. Many units blindly send people to learn from experts, with no practical effect and will only cause waste.' \\n'The Soviet experts are stupid, I have a formula on the line, and the experts need to explain the information for half a day, not yet clear, very stupid. I now lose my PhD in the United States and get a new one is very easy.' (Abstract of Qian Chung Yi's reactionary remarks)\\n8. 'Democracy ',' freedom ', and the stigmatization of socialist democracy and freedom\\n'The Saudi King's visit to the United States, the mayor of New York did not pick it up, and then Eisenhower met in person, which showed a clear division of power between the US local government and the central government. Eisenhower has no way to him either.' (Meaning praise for American democracy)\\n'Our secrecy system has been extended too. Now everything is kept secret. Public security personnel need to take pictures on the road. When I'm in the United States, I look at whatever, no one manages... how free my money Zhong Yi is in the United States.' \\n'I used to hate the KMT, now I don't hate it.' And he said, 'It's good to talk about life, or the past. Being a treasurer can have everything, free and comfortable.' \\n'I think there is a serious bureaucracy in the government today, without democracy, the representatives of the people have no real power and do not work at all. Who has something to find a representative of the people, is not going to the Party Committee yet.' \\n'Subordinate under the authority of the superior shall unconditionally follow the instructions of the superior. Matters falling under the authority of the subordinate, the superior shall not interfere with it, and the subordinate shall not ask for more advice.' \\n'I never felt I had a mandate. I think I am very powerful as head of the Education and Research Group, and I can do what I want to do. But if you don't want to do it, you can do nothing. And no one comes to me. Now the problem is the chaos of the system, the leadership is incompetent. He always says good, it doesn't matter.' (Abstract of Qian Chung Yi's reactionary remarks)\\n'Democracy now is false, 'unanimous passing' is just superficial and fundamentally unstable.' \\n'Democracy now is the Communist Party and leadership to come up with a proposal, and we talk about it.' \\n'The CPPCC contains the nature of a House of Lords. The Communist Party cannot be considered right for the establishment of the CPPCC. It is wrong for others to advocate the establishment of the upper house (the design house).' 'To set up a political design institute cannot be considered to take the leadership of the Party. For example, the owner of the business director has to do the design by a consultant engineer. It cannot be considered to give up sovereignty.' (Qian zhongyi Check 2)\\nIX. Stigma socialist construction\\n'Liu Shaoqi eight report said that the problem now is that productivity lag behind production is not feasible. Liu Shaoqi's phrase means that the Communist Party has resolved the problem of production relations, and that the people are responsible for falling behind in productivity. I think the problems now and later are always a matter of production relations.' \\n'It cannot be said that the gains made in productivity development have been demonstrated by the standards of production at the time of liberation in 1949 as a basis, simply because of the superiority of the social system. It is natural that there is a great development of production after the end of war and the transition into peace.' \\n'The increase in percentage does not show the rate of production development (real), positive face, absolute increments are also important.' \\nIn the wage reform, he said: 'The government estimates big (too), optimistic, only taking into account the gross growth rate of production. In fact, the productivity of consumptive goods should be the main criterion for determining wage growth. The government has not yet taken into account the increase in total wages due to the increase in employment.' \\n'In the past in the struggle for life and death with Chiang Kai-shek, the revolutionaries who committed their minds and subjective mistakes have sent their heads to people. Therefore, at this time the Communist Party is in power. Now the Communist Party is in power, there is a regime protecting it, and may be intoxicated under the slogan 'Achievement is Basic'. This is true yesterday, and may not be the case today.' \\n'Students are now 'blind 'when enrolling in college,' a choice for lifelong '.' 'Various professional names create 'rigidity' in students' minds and are the root cause of 'learning and not used'.' \\nThe study of certain high and deep courses in universities and universities is said to be: 'But in vain waste of students' time in order to gain a deep and false name.' \\n'The teaching plan will also need to be drastically revised.' 'The previous period, which was essentially a phase of socialist transformation, has been completed. The next step should be a comprehensive socialist construction, beginning a new phase, and everything should be reconsidered.' (Qian zhongyi Check 2)\\n'Production relationships constrain productivity development, and our manpower has not yet been liberated.' \\n'Many statistics are deceiving now, and after liberation, productivity growth is too slow and seems to be less than the pre-war productivity growth rate.' \\n'I think the fundamental problem now is the speed of industrialization, it is useless to say what things grow and how many times it is useless, productivity is always constantly developing, to bring productivity growth, go now than years before the liberation of war years, of course... I think it's not enough to talk about productivity growth first, Lord The pace of industrialization should be seen in order to see whether the socialist system was Superior? I'm looking at it now. Look at the second five-year plan productivity growth rate is increased! Or maintain the status quo.' \\n'Wage reform made a mess.' 'Instead of increasing people's motivation to work, wage reform has been negative.' \\n'In wage reform, Germany, talent, and capital are empty words. A visible measure must be established, namely, the degree system is more difficult than the rhetoric of virtue, talent, and resources are much harder than a comprehensive consideration.' (Abstract of Qian Chung Yi's reactionary remarks)\\nX. Other\\n'Business is born at a desk and meeting out, it seems to be busy, actually do not do no problem.' \\nAfter listening to Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of internal contradictions among the people, he said: 'It is now possible to understand that absolute unity of thought is an ideal. At the international level, the concept of peaceful coexistence has finally been accepted, and even if the believers of capitalism and communism are absolutely confrontational, do not have to kill you and die and live together. Internal contradictions should also be tolerated.' \\n'When society jumps, there are many people who are not satisfied with the status quo, that is the period of the rise of materialism, and when society leaps, when society is stable and settled in the status quo, people become meticulous.' (Qian zhongyi Check 2)\\n'What life outlook is not life, I don't care about that set, I'm not doing the same design?'

				"memoirContent": "【Attachment 1】Yao Dan: Behind the Grass Articles (People's Daily, 1957.8.16)\\n[People's Daily Reporter Yao Dan] Although the 'grass article' written by Liusha River has long been notorious, the right-wing elements have struggled to paint it, saying it was a 'fragrant flower' released in response to the call of the Party Central Committee. In Sichuan literary circles, led by Shitianhe (i.e. Zhou Tianzhe, 'star' editor), including Liusha River (member, star editor), Bai Hang (party member, 'star' editorial director), Qiu Yuan (that is, Qiuyang, provincial literary association cadres), a day (team member, 'grass' editor), Chen Qian (that is, Qianzi, 'Meadow' Editor), Remote Climbing (Meadow Editor), Bai Causeway (Lyrics Editor), Xiao Feng (i.e. Huang Ze A large group of right-wing elements such as Rong, the editor of the Chengdu Daily), Xu Hang (i.e. Xu Rongzhong and students of Chengdu Second Normal School), are indeed there warmly 'responding' to the call of the Party Central Committee and strive to implement a hundred 'flowers' of all miles! 'Grass' is just one of them. \\nThe Star was launched in January this year. Long before the launch of the publication, Shitianhe, Liushahe and Bai Hang secretly planned the anti-party conspiracy through the Star. They set the direction of the Star: not to take the 'celebrity line', thereby excluding progressive poets, to cultivate a group of 'authors' in accordance with their anti-party intentions; 'Manuscripts do not work mechanically with politics,' in an attempt to build on their anti-socialist works. On this basis, Shitianhe wrote an agreement to openly exclude socialist realism works. Under the guidance of this explicit anti-party platform, the first phase of 'stars' appeared 'grass' and another bad poem 'kiss'. \\nThis spring, after being criticized, they conspired to use all kinds of despicable means to launch rampant attacks against the party. This large group of right-wing elements almost all wrote 'anti-criticism' articles full of abusive attacks and put them in various newspapers. Some of the articles even wrote: 'The fake crown is quickly taken off, tiger leather chair is about to sit unstable!' And the critics were 'old clients of brothels'. These articles have not been published and they intend to print secretly and distribute them throughout the country. Another vicious way for them is to continue poison on the Stars. It was decided to publish more anti-party satirical poems and poems of decadence and sorrow later. Liushahe threatened to write 'insect', he shouted: 'You are afraid, Lao Zi two days (meaning later), to do!' \\nAt this time, the only thing they fear is losing the 'star', the anti-party territory. So big rumors: 'The stars' are surrounded by which!' 'The world is not messy first!' Bai Air also discussed with the River Shahe and wrote letters to friends everywhere, asking them to justify and touted 'stars' and 'grass articles' in the press. \\nThe anti-party activity of this group of right-wing elements does not stop with the Star, nor does it begin after the 'grass' article was criticized. \\nAfter the events in Hungary last year, the activities of this opposition group have been particularly arrogant. Some openly said: 'We are here the Pedofi Club.' Shitianhe shouted: 'To kill!' 'If I was in Hungary, I would pick up the gun rod too!' Also scolded: 'Now the Communist Party member is an official, everyone's wife and concubine. One day, the lone dog party fell over one day!' Quicksand River also shouted: 'How good to live in capitalist countries now!' Okawara (who was expelled from the Communist Youth League in the past), even slander 'Chairman Mao is a personal heroism.' \\nIn addition to this explicit attack, they also dressed themselves as 'Marxism-Leninist followers,' attacking the party under the anti-dogmatic 'flag of righteousness'. From the head of the Ministry of Propaganda of the Central Committee and the Provincial Committee to the Provincial Federation, from many Chinese writers to Soviet writers, and all those who criticized the 'Grasswood' and them, they had been falsely accused of being 'dogmist' and attacked them. \\nBai Air is the faithful sit-in of this anti-party group in the party. After the launch of the 'star' issue, Li Lie, secretary of the provincial Federation of the Party branch secretary, will his views on the 'grass' and the head of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Committee on 'kiss' told him, reminding the party members of the 'star'. Instead, he reported the situation to stone, stream and others, and on several occasions, misrepresented the situation within the party to the stone, stream and other people, supplying them with anti-party material. When anti-party activities such as Stone and Stream aroused people's anger and turned to repudiate, Bai Air said at the meeting that they 'work hard' and 'is for good work.' When the Quicksand River threatened to yell: 'Interference with Laozi, Laozi strikes! Lao Zi rebellion!' When, Bai Air also made tough to the leadership: 'criticism again will not do it!' Some people wrote materials that expose Shi Tianhe's reactionary words and deeds, and gave him for reference to the party organization, but he withheld it privately and never handed it over. \\nUnder the justice of the masses, the reactionary flame fell on the surface. Quite Tianhe also retreat to Emei Mountain to 'buried to create' to go. But this, as Xu Hang, the right-wing activist said: 'Silence is not depressed. Silence is that ammunition is being loaded into the bore and the bore!' \\nCertainly, in May this year, during the colloquium held by the provincial wenith, the river appeared as the 'star' 'grass article', shouting for the opposition group. Describe criticism of 'grass' as being 'besieged', and the criticism of their reactionary words and deeds as being subjected to 'internal and external attacks.' It is also bloody to say that they have been 'politically framed' and that 'freedom of communication has been restricted.' Qiuyuan, Chu Yiday, Xiaofeng, etc. also criticized Sichuan literary circles with a combination of dogmatism and sectarianism, and rooted in the provincial committee. \\nIt turns out that stone Tianhe was laid out before leaving: now can be silent, the time has come to say again. The content of the speech at the symposium, who? Fight against whom? When to attend or not to participate in the symposium and other issues, we have discussed secretly in advance the river, qiuyuan, xiaofeng and so on. \\nAt this time, Xu Hang has been hiding in the dark place, constantly writing letters to the River Shahe. On the letter he claimed: 'Before Mr. Shi Tianhe (Shitianhe), my shooting was blind, scattered, and in the future, I will have a planned and purposeful focus.' After Liushahe spoke at the symposium, Xu Hang was greatly pleased, and sent a letter to Liushahe, saying, 'Your counterattack is already known. The gun hit well, fierce and spicy.' But he immediately warned the River River: 'If you have to step by step and forget the strategy of 'right to stop, 'you will be in the' enemy deep. '' \\nShitianhe, already hidden in Mount Emei, also set up the 'command desk' on the mountain. While writing articles to Wen Wei Bao, he shouted 'Jincheng Spring Festival Gala'; right-wing activists who were grappling elsewhere wrote articles to newspapers and speeches for the symposium in Sichuan Province, verbally abusive attacks; and also directed the activities of opposition groups based on reports by Liusha River and others. He saw Qiuyuan in his speech without following his 'don't pull it wide' instructions and attacked outside the party, writing to Liushahe, saying, 'Don't just pursue outrage and lose the masses sympathy.' It was also directed that 'more constructive comments should be made and the disclosure of contradictions should be combined in making constructive opinions, so that resistance could be reduced'. At the same time, he wrote a book of thousands of words to be read out at the symposium on the river river. \\nHis word book is an anti-party platform that attacks on the fundamental principles and policies of the party. Quicksand River saw not dare to read. Reply to Stone: 'You are far from the depths of the white clouds, too unaware of the climate in the dust... if your shocking bomb explodes, what will happen? ... they will hit you with a stick that is three times more fierce than Takebara. Because your bomb is more powerful than his atomic bomb, it's a hydrogen bomb.' And Shitianhe thinks that the Liushahe is growing up others' ambition, extinguishing their own majesty, and a letter saying: 'You can not believe in the kindness and grace of the tyrant, but only believe in the power of struggle.' He still wants the quicksand river to release the 'hydrogen bomb'. \\nUntil the people across the country began to refute the right-wing speech, Shitianhe thought that the situation was not 'good', and immediately burned a batch of letters, and called Liushahe to send back the books of thousands of words and intended to be rewritten. He also directed the River Shahe and others: 'The struggle must continue... hopefully you remain optimistic... do not fully take an exit attitude.' \\nBehind this anti-party group, two prominent right-wing generals stand, one of which is Zhang Mercson (Allied member and head of the Chinese Department of Sichuan University). \\nIt is not strange to mention Zhang Mercson people. Twenty years ago, when he was the principal of Jinan Middle School, he attacked the revolutionary writer Hu Yepin and forced him to leave the school. Progressive students have been expelled later. He is the author of 'Biography of Li Zongwu', and wrote a preamble to 'Biography of Martial Arts'. After liberation, he became a favoured member of the right of the NLD. Luolongji and Fei Xiaotong came to Chengdu to talk to him. Pan Dakui first went to visit his house once he went to Sichuan University. \\nAfter the wind began, Zhang Morson, called 'a sense of justice' by Shitianhe, finally stood out to speak. While he set fire at Sichuan University, he said: 'This time the whole wind is a test for Chairman Mao and others. Not good, as soon as there is wind and grass in the international community, the Communist Party is over.' On one side and again at the symposium, for the Liushahe, Shitianhe. First pop up 'poetry is not up to assessment', saying that poetry can not have a fixed explanation, it is best to let the author note, for the 'grass article' defense. Then he asked the party's criminal division, 'Why do you want to publish so many articles that block literary policy (referring to articles criticizing the 'Grasswood')?' \\n'Why do you want to fight for a couple of days?' 'Is it going to let the flowers go up? Or let the grass not live?' 'The star poems are just unearthed shoots, why are leaders to relentless destruction?' \\nThe other is Fan Yan (also known as Huan Bangxian, Allied Member, Wen Wei Po correspondent in Sichuan). \\nThe wind began, when the Liushahe River, Qiuyuan and other people did not attend the symposium according to the prior agreement, but still in the foresight of the day, waiting for the 'climate improvement', Fan Yan came to visit the Liusha River. Written the notorious 'Liusha River talk about 'grass'. Then Fan Yan went through the River Shahe to find Bai Air, and made clear to Bai Hang that his visit was to listen to some 'internal information' from his mouth as an 'internal reference'. He asked Bai Hang: 'Criticism of 'grass' is a good role? How bad is it?' White answer: 'bad effect... did not see what the problem of grass articles...' Fan went on to say: 'I read the 'grass' did not see what to come!' \\nWhen people began to pursue the right, Fan Yan and other collusion with Zhang Morson, the River Shahe and other other countervails. Fan Yan's speech about Li Liu debunking the truth of the 'political fraudulent' slanted by the River River. In addition to distorting reports, Drift Shahe has adopted a new tactic of refusing to attend the symposium. In addition to distorting reports, he called a telegram to Wen Wei to report, falsely alleging that 'Grass and Wood' Colloquium Liusha River was unwilling to attend. Therefore, Li Liu spoke to certain 'These questions do not talk about, forming a new siege.' Later, the anti-party bloc conspiracy was gradually exposed. People like Shitianhe, Liushahe and others felt that 'the general situation has gone', Fan Yan still shouted in Chengdu, and threatened to say, 'People like the Union of Soviet Union, Li Liu and other people don't have to see what they can't do, just put the material out!' \\nThe intrigues and tricks of the anti-party group led by Shitianhe have become apparent. Liushahe, Bai Hang and others have been forced to make some representations, but it is very incomplete, especially Shitianhe, still not honestly and honestly well. The struggle against these right-wing elements in Sichuan province continues. (People's Daily, 1957.8.16)\\n"

Now written in several ways:\\n(a), For counteraction\\n(1), I said, 'The fight was bad, hurt my self-esteem. \\n(2), I said, 'In rebellion, keeping me in detention for half a year is an infringement of personal freedom. \\n(3), I said: The constitutional provisions protect the freedom of personal expression, and once the movement comes, it will not take effect. \\n(4), I said: it is wrong to mention about five percent of the bad guys when counteracting. The Central Committee said this way, the following does not follow the specific situation, on the subjective view: Wulian hundred people, there should be five people. That's why I was tried. And said: 5 million intellectuals, are there 250,000 counter-revolutions? The depth of subjectivity is visible! \\n(5), I said: to put people in the studio closed, or to protect, it simply doesn't work. \\n(6), I said: After rebelling, my motivation is finished. \\n(7), I said: Originally, I also believed that the leadership did not entirely want to cheer me, after rebuttal, this belief was retained only a little bit. Qiu (referring to the right-wing member Qiu Yuan-Editor's Note), said: I have long been desperate with the party. \\n(8), Initially, I talked about the River Shahe, I doubt whether Hu Feng is a counter-revolution? Later, he heard Maple that there were democrats in Beijing requesting bail for Hu Feng. Hu Feng was not a counter-revolution at all. I believe it, and said: Is there such a silly counter-revolution, writing 300,000 words to attack? 'Hu is just a matter of history,' said Liushahe. Now they (refer to the party), to ride horseback. (Note: Stream said at the meeting he never doubted whether Hu Feng was counter-revolutionary, that was a lie!), \\n(ii), Responses to the Bosnian incident and international issues\\n(1), At the time of the events in Hungary, I said: Democratic freedom is really important. We in China also have such factors. Otherwise, why should Premier Zhou come to a report on the intellectuals issue? \\n(2), I said: The cause of the events in Hungary was to hurt national self-esteem. China's hard moving Soviet experience has not yet hurt national self-esteem. \\n(3), I said, 'Now, should you knock the alarm bell for the party, right? \\n(4), I say: Tito is the brightest leader and the most liberal in Yugoslavia. \\n(5), I said: The Hungarian events began with a revolution at all. Qadar declared that the incident was insurrectional. If there is a problem, it is simply not possible to push it on capitalist countries. Actually, that incident was the result of bureaucracy. \\n(6), I said: Qadar also made the means of Rakosi come. \\n(7), After the publication of 'On the proletarian dictatorship', I said: I doubt there is revisionism. He also said: Yugoslavia has done well, then democratic freedom, and said that people have distorted Marxist-Leninist Miles. \\n(8), I say: The personal worship of Stalin is simply the result of the system. Qiu said: How could Stalin rule for 20 years without a political system suitable for personal worship? Quicksand River said: Stalin's early days in Georgia, he created political frauds. This was pointed out when Lenin died. Later, Stalin took over his opponents, such as Toloski, one by one, to take his power alone. Stream also said: Stalin has a secret police, placed on top of the party's central party, so he can do whatever he wants. \\n(9), I said: Stalin came to power by political framing. \\n(10), I said: People who used to say Tito were counter-revolutionary, including journalists cartoonists, had no conscience. This talk flow、Qiu said。 \\n(11), I agree with Tito that Su send troops is necessary, but a mistake. Qiu said: the Soviet Union sent troops, it was a great power chauvinism \\n(12), I said: Rakosi's fall of power and the Gro reservation must be given prior consent of the Soviet Union. So, what is Hungary free and independent? The Soviet Union is interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. It is the chauvinism \\n(3), to the social system, life, etc. \\n(1), I said: Democracy is concentrated, it should be democratic before concentration; now it is counter-productive, and before it is concentrated before democracy. Like rating, the above decided before it was scored down. Like the election, the above decision first decided to elect a few people, and the masses passed by raising their hands. These things simply cannot speak of democracy. \\n(2), I said: Witchism like the previous election, there is also a superficial competition, and now even this has been canceled. \\n(3), I said: Last year many cities celebrated the entry into socialism, simply formalism. In fact, many barbershops, paper cigarette shops, free joint venture signs, their essence is private. \\n(4), I said: China's personal worship also exists. What songs and poems, all compare Chairman Mao to a Savior Sun Dad; the popularity of these poems is not prohibited, is it not to preach personal worship? Does it have nothing to do with the system? He also said: Because of misinformation about Chairman Mao's criticism of Chen Qitong and others, the following is a chaos. This is precisely the danger of personal worship. \\n(5), I said many times: I do not want anything, as long as it is free. \\n(6), I said: egg pork supply is not available, always the food purchase made a deviation, farmers do not feed the pig to feed chicken. Xiao Feng also told me that the overall purchase was the hard figures above, forcing the peasants to death. \\n(7), I, Qiu said: the Party itself lacks self-criticism. We can't admit openly, but it will be wrong. \\n(8), I said: Every unit must be placed party members to lead. So, sometimes it becomes a lay leader, how can we not hinder the work? \\n(9), I said: Minor politics, writing more to eat is good. \\n(10), I refused to change the mind, said: the transformation of ideas over the years, changed, changed out of two kinds of people, one is like me backward, the other is to climb up. \\n(4), to the literature\\n(1), I said: There is a small circle of sectarianism in the WWL, which started after the province. Li Li came from East Sichuan, he had seats to, Fu Qiu, Wenxin; Youxin came from South Sichuan, Yang Shuqing, Chen Zhiguang, Zhou Tianzhe (at that time Zhou had not been stigmatized with Youxin). \\n(2), I said: Li tired to protect people. If Fu Qiu Xi Xiang, there are clearly problems in history, and will not engage in counteractions; Chen Xin is all the more so. And I, there was no political problem in history, but I wanted to be skeptical and polarized. This is not sectarianism. What is it? I talked to Qiu Yang many times. \\n(3), I said: Li Lie is the most subjective, most brutal. After listening to the drifting sand river rumors, he said: Li tired insidious. Liu said that Li Laishang power is good at pulling up a group of people, cracking a group of people. I said, 'Li Lie is a paternalistic rule against us. \\n(4), I said: Youxin is superficially humble, actually the most subjective. And he said, From Youxin, I have seen the characteristics of Sergeant Prišbeev. \\n(5), I cursed Yang Shuqing 'what things', scolded the table to 'rape and cunning terrible, used to fabricate rumors', cursed Chen Xin 'insidious', cursed Chen Xin 'and don't rely on to climb up to eat, why tout'. In one word, all villains. \\n(6), I said to the River Shahe: to Li tired and so on, I am 'averse away'; to the seat, is 'hate and far away'. \\n(7), I said, 'The leadership is out of the masses, and only listen to those few people blowing in their ears. \\n(8), I say every time I criticize me, it is to cheer me \\n(9), I said: the permanent director is not a great deal, all things listen to Li tired of mercy. Qiu said: the permanent director, like Jia Mu, is not yet aware of the harm. \\n(10), I said: Wenlian affair is Li tired to count. \\n(11), I said: Wenlian is a long place, have to leave quickly. Qiu said: Wenlian is a villain gaining momentum, leading bias. We said, 'We have to try to professionalize quickly, and only then can we be free. \\n(12), I said: People are afraid of sad, tree afraid of peeling. Back to the movement all cheer me, cheer like that miserable, also called to play positive, I only have a negative one! \\n(5), Literary and Artistic Thought\\n(1), I mistakenly believe that the leadership of the party, including literary and artistic policy, communist worldview, are dogmatic, saying: this is the root cause of the formulation of conceptualization. \\n(2), I said: Due to dogmism, the films, lengths, songs, drama have not appeared in good works for several years, and is not as good as the age of May 4. \\n(3), I say: there is a strange phenomenon, the conceptualization of formulas, where democracies produce the most; adding that the birthplace of dogmatism is the Soviet Union. \\n(4), I agree very much with some Polish writers that socialist realism is a deflation of realism. Says: Socialist realism is the biggest dogma. \\n(5), I said: I should oppose the essence, the mainstream theory and the theory of major conflict. Think of this as soon as the work is written, and it will lead to conceptualization. \\n(6), I said: literary arts have no class at all. Like Chekhov's novel, people from all walks of life around the world love. \\n(7), I advocate that literature and art serve humanity and do not necessarily serve a certain class. \\n(8), I advocate: to write a good work, as long as one condition is 'conscience plus skill'. \\n(9), I said: Theory cannot guide creation, the more dogma learn, better not to learn. I claim that I am a skeptic in literary theory. On this, the River Sand River has debated with me. He said, 'How can dogmatism be defeated without theory? \\n(10), I said: Literature should reflect reality. There is a dark thing in life that should be exposed, otherwise it is not called realism. \\n(11), I said: Socialist realism is called to have a certain degree of whitewash of life, so it is a kind of metamorphosis. \\n(12), I said: The Party's propaganda department, who does not understand literature and art, will come to lead, and the results only greatly contribute to the conceptualization of the formula. \\nThat is my reactionary words and deeds. Most of the revelations in the big print are real, they are not written. All these reactionary remarks, which are unwritten, are all I talking about with Qiu Yuan. Most of them I talked about him, some of them, and flow, Xiao, remote (referring to right-wing-editor's note), talked about, to flow most. \\n(vi), Words and Deeds at the Editorial Office of the Grassland\\nIn the editorial office, I, the store (referring to the right to save a day-the editor's note), the three people, sang together, in an attempt to cancel the party leadership and try to change the direction of editing. But it should be made clear that my words and deeds have not been supported by anyone, nor has I given any support. \\n(1), When Youxin was coming, I said: I did not work well in the future. And he said, I will go when you come. Similar words have been said remotely. We sing together, saying we feel an invisible pressure in our heart. I said, 'Youxin is the most dogmatic, and he comes, and the review will not be free. I also publicly said that Youxin dictatorship, cursed Yang Shuqing anything. Later said: I'm not doing it! Later he said: If anyone else uses administrative means to deal with me, I will curse! I do so, I want to make friends less hinder my 'freedom'. \\n(2), In the organizational form of the editorial department of 'grass', who proposed to cancel the executive editing, the store also proposed to cancel the team leader. I very much agree, saying that the two-tiered system is best, can simplify the review process, improve the efficiency of work, etc. Editorial independence is also promoted. Actually, want to increase their power. \\n(3), I also emphasize so-called collective leadership. said: The editor-in-chief should not have the final decision. said: In the event of a disagreement between the editor-in-chief and the editor, the manuscript should be submitted for discussion and a final decision should be taken. Its purpose is nothing but to weaken the power of Youxin. \\n(4), Who proposed editors take turns when performing editors (save one day and Vincing raised), I began to agree, and later felt that doing so would still not be free, I disagreed. \\n(5), On the editorial policy, I said: Socialist realism, I do not understand, and I am afraid you do not understand it, so do not have to promote it. He added: Realism and Romanticism should be promoted only. Remote, storage are agreed. Later on, I used to talk about my mistaken literary view (as mentioned above), saying: Today's work, there is too little romanticism. I also said: Literature and art do not have to write workers and peasants, do not have to write positive figures, do not necessarily have to serve workers and farmers, etc. Its purpose is nothing but to change the political orientation of the publication. \\n(6), Special mention should be made of intervention in life that we often preach. I advocate bold intervention in life, boldly expose the dark side. Storage, remote too advocate. I said Xiao Feng wrote it well because his work was in line with my mind. 'Reflect to the party' a draft, I, remote, store all say true. I, remote advocate to use, save advocates the author's own change. I have said many times that Xiao Feng's work is real realism. I not only deleted it for him, but also offered to recommend the set. Although the collection was agreed by Wen Xin, but I was afraid to come out, and privately wrote an introduction letter that Xiao Feng was 'a better amateur author'. Chen Jun's script that distorts life, in my eyes, has also become real, and only gives some advice on skill. 'Reflect to the Party' after the two sequels of the lead print, I told it remotely, I had advised to take away, lest it be criticized. \\n(7), the theoretical part of the journal, it is the combat force. I can't say openly to abolish theory, but say: Theory cannot guide creation, I am a skeptic of theory, etc. Those views were also widely supported. I also said that most of these criticisms, which refer to the grass articles, are dogmatic. That said, there was nothing more than a desire to cancel the theory. \\n(8), At the beginning of the breadth, I did not understand the situation, I said many bad words to him, such as saying Youxin dogma, Yang Shuqing horrible, desperately insidious, and so on, the intention to make him dissatisfied, and he once said to Zhou, renting the rebellion to me, and intended to obtain sympathy. These words and deeds have served to provoke leadership and relations between comrades, comrades and leaders, comrades and comrades. \\nWhat I did at the editorial office was aimed at cancelling or weakening the party's leadership. It should be said that Zhou Tianzhe and the Liushahe did in the stars have played a certain influence in my mind. I propose, for example, that I do not have to comply with the commuting system, or to move hard from them. \\n(7), When criticizing the 'grass'\\n(1), began to criticize the 'grass articles' and 'kiss', stream, Qiu, Xiao, remote and me, privately said that 'grass' is not poisonous grass at all, said dogmatic attack. I said, 'kiss' is not erotic at all and is very real. 'Those who criticize the 'kiss' are all fake masters. These words have also been said publicly in the editorial office. \\n(2), One night, the river river came to my house. At that time, Qiu Yuan was there Stream said some 'insider news' such as Li Lai's bulletin at the propaganda department and engaged in political framing, etc. (It is now clear that this is a rumor made by Zhou), My thoughts are reactionary, and this instigation is even more powerful. At that time, the flow also said that it should fight back, and should generate public opinion. Later we also cursed Li tired (as mentioned earlier). \\n(3), I write an article 'The answer of the poplar'. The content is for the Liushahe defense, attack Youxin. I put this thing, signed a pseudonym and handed over to Liushahe. Liu said he immediately transferred to the newspaper, that is, it was a reader to write. \\n(4), At that time, he heard Maple saying that he had gone everywhere to organize counter-criticism. \\n(5), After the executive meeting, Qiu and I praised Zhou and Liu scolded well. Later, Stream said: Don't speak at the meeting tomorrow and see what they do. And said: Silence is resistance. \\n(6), Soon after, the stream、Week has been criticized。 I was scared, had called the stream not to expose me. \\n(7), I talked about this matter privately with Qiu, saying, 'Never attend that meeting, lest you be angry. I said, 'Even hungry rice, do not go to participate.' So I wrote my retirement book and decided to be free from the revolution. Later, the Quicksand River came to persuade me, said the interests, I was afraid, only went to participate. \\n(8), After being criticized, I said to Qiu Yuan: Do not care for those things anymore, or whether it is a good thing to write the work to eat. After that, I and outsiders will not be in contact. Only Qiu Yuan, because of collective creation, often come. Quicksand rivers sometimes come to whistle. \\n(9), I and Qiu Yuan said: have to quickly strive for specialization, dissociate from the Union. \\n(8), When zooming\\n(1), When zooming in, I am still skeptical, so I do not want to appear and speak only inside. I said, 'The results of the transformation of several years have transformed me so called 'seven gentlemen', and on the other side there was a seat to such a person. And he said: I have desperated with the leaders of the Union. These words, all carry an offensive nature. \\n(2), I also wanted to go to the General Assembly to defend the 'Grasswood' article, which was later dissolved. I said: I only participate in the put, not to take part in Naruto \\n(3), To Qiu Yang (i.e. Qiuyuan), I said, 'Scolded well. But I advised him to delete the words 'Tsang Guofan' when he was at the school sample. He also felt it was not true, and he deleted it. \\n(4), I also agree with Chu's statement, but he says there is no sectarianist group, but I disagree. \\n(5), the river river retreat, the first was to drink tea in the People's Park at the night, he talked about many dissatisfaction with the group organization, saying that the group not only did not protect him, against him as a wooden fish, beat at times. At that time, both I and Qiu Yuan advised him to withdraw. Qiu said, 'You have returned to the regiment so as not to be shaken I said, 'You will be free when you leave the regiment.' He agreed. \\n(6), Once, I, Qiu, Liu and another friend (former classmate), went to South Suburban Park for tea. Go, because Xiaofeng's family was there, Reuben and Xiaofeng talked about. We played Park on this side for a long time, and the River Sand River came to us and took Wenwei Po to show us, which has his 'visit'. Qiu Yuan said, 'You should add the name of Li Li, so that he may also taste the suffering of criticism. I agree. Stream expresses regret. \\n(7), After that, I went down. When he went to Jiangyou and Qiu Yuan, he said: Temporarily free. Hurry up to create, strive for early specialization. \\nI will continue to do so. \\nAugust 3 (the Office of the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of the Communist Party of Sichuan Provincial Committee prepared 'Sichuan right speech selection 10/ internal documents, for reference only for the reference of leaders, do not pass and reprint' September 5, 1957)\\n"

'I agree with Qian zi (note: Chen Qian),' said Bai Hang. \\n(2), the climbing novel, just on its structure, is always strange; and the content, mostly reactionary. Once, I advised him to consider the way out of the works and said structurally he walked the evil door. He said: 'I can save without sending it, and one day it will prove that my writing path is right.' \\n(3), I think, and repeatedly stressed, that the most important thing is the depth of the subject-that is, there must be a philosophy of life. For example: 'Playing the sparrow itself, no matter how it is written, can not contain the philosophy of life. So this subject can not be written deeply.' This was said publicly at the editorial office, privately and Qiu Yuan. He concurred. \\n(4), I think that small things in life, if you can show the depth of the theme, are good themes. I think Chekhov's novel, attests to this, as one of my arguments against the 'theory of major conflict.' \\n(5), I, Liu and Qiu believe that Chinese films except 'white hair women' are poor, especially low artistic. We said, 'It's all about dogmatism.' \\n(6), I, Qiu Zeng said, 'We feel sad about the Chinese literary career. This way, it will never again appear Lu Xun and Cao Xueqin.' \\n(7), I often say: so far, there has never been a better work than the 'Red House Dream' in Chinese literature history. Why does Cao Xueqin have no Marxist-Leninist views, but is much better than a writer with Marxinism? \\nAugust 7 (the Office of the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of the Communist Party of Sichuan Provincial Committee prepared 'Sichuan right speech selection 10/ internal documents, for reference only for the reference of leaders, do not pass and reprint' September 5, 1957)\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 4"

All the machine guns of our army are ready, and you will be alarmed, and you are all swept away.' After liberation, hiding handguns and sheltering landlords and anti-revolutionary elements have consistently distorted and destroyed the Government's major policies and measures. In particular, this spring took advantage of the opportunity of the party reckoning to attack the party rampant, he said: 'In our country, there is no freedom of press, no freedom of association, no freedom of speech, no freedom of residence.' He argued that 'Communist Party members are plainclothes policemen' and that the Communist Party is grabbing 'boring people' and 'useless people.' He said that the problem of counteraction was very biased and wronged a lot of good people. He also said upside down in black and white: 'Peasants live bitter.

Some right-wing elements have begun to plead guilt and confess some problems. The confidence of the masses in defeating the right has increased; however, some rightists are still extremely unhonest; they use all kinds of tricks to try to muddle the customs. \\nAt first, the right-wing activists refused to account for their usual reactionary words and deeds. They also played with the 'thief shouting and catching thief' tactics, deluding to escape the struggle His conspiracy sparked the rage of the masses. Three group meetings were held on July 23, 24, and August 2, respectively, to adopt a method of laying down facts, reasoning, layers of peeling. In the face of the fact of iron, Qin Shufu had to admit that for eight years he had issued a series of anti-communist anti-socialist calls; admitted that he had seen peasants in Liling inspection. Life is good, still kill chicken to entertain him, but he fabricated rumors everywhere that 'peasants live bitter'; concede land reform when sheltering bullies Landlord Tang Ding Hoon; admitted that he had litigated party members as plainclothes police officers He acknowledged that these reactionary remarks and deeds were aimed at opposing and bringing down the Government. The masses warned that he must sincerely repent and fully account for their crimes. Chen Yuxin, a right-wing member, has pleaded guilty because of the deep pursuit of the cultural community, and has confessed some problems. \\nThe second branch of Changsha City of Minkor recently held five meetings to expose and criticize the right-wing activist Yang Siyi. When Yang Siyi's rightist face was completely exposed, he had a poor rhetoric and made six written representations, but still avoided weight and was not willing to truly surrender. Everyone warned that Yang Siyi can only show that he has sincerity of repentance, otherwise the people will not answer. \\nThe material revealed by the masses shows that the right-wing activist Ling Zhaoyao has always opposed the people's democratic dictatorship, undermines land reform, sympathizes with the counter-revolution, and defames the party's policy of united war. In his written representations, he rejected his reactionary words and deeds, and refused to confess guilt to the fallacy he made at the meeting of the provincial CPPCC. This shows that Ling Zhaoyao also has no manifestation of remorse. In this way, it will be free from the people. \\nLiu Yuehou, an old and crafty right-wing activist, has stunned his attitude, playing up politicians' rogue tactics at the struggle meeting, trying to evade guilt, without any manifestation of remorse. \\nFrom July 12th to 16th, Liu Yuehou wrote a 'review' to resist some material revealed by the masses at the struggle meeting; or pretending to be confused, or shamelessly cunning, it was all to dig hollow minds. Delusional blame for his consistent anti-Communist anti-socialism is pushed to one or two net. At the July 17th struggle meeting, he said that his sympathy and shelter anti-revolutionary Huang Jiayang and other things were before 1952. On the spot someone broke up his lies, pointing out that he also said to people during his visit to Yueyang this year, 'Huang Jiaxing is a good person'. In the struggle, he also denied his sin when he ruled Hunan bloody, shamelessly said: 'He Kan ruled Hunan, he has nothing to do with me, he wants to shovel together, I still very opposed him, a faction wants anti-Communist, I also often fight with them...' to say, it seems that he is against 'shovel together' of. In his written review on July 31, he also only overemphasized that 'when he ruled Hunan, my sin was deep', understated, and was invisible under the hat. The historical facts of Iron made a relentless rebuttal to Liu Yuehou. According to the Hunan Yearbook, 'In October 1934, Liu Yuehou and Zhai Zhai stationed in Hengyang, to deal with banditry matters. After Liu Daheng set up a stationary office, instructing the county party departments to carry out coordination work, and issued the 'Organizing Outline of the Civil Association Committee against Bandit Counties in Hunan Province', 'County-Party Department Handling Sporadic' 'Measures to disperse banditry', 'county party departments implement defense campaign', 'anti-banditry propaganda program', etc. On November 23, Liu departed from Changde and all members of the committee, and on December 25, three people including Liu and Peng Guojun went to Shaoyang to attend a banditry propaganda conference...' Liu Yuehou never pleaded guilty to these 'crackdown' facts. Since July 17, in addition to forcefully rebutting the lies and slanes of the right-wing activist Liu Yuehou, the masses who participated in the fight have also revealed his reactionary rumours and some unspeakable manipulations he carried out. Liu Yuehou is an extremely intransigent right-wing, and members of the Democratic Leather expressed their intention to continue to expose rebuttal, not to win all, and never recruit soldiers. \\nRecently, a group of right-wing elements such as Peng Ye (member of the Changsha Municipal Committee of Mingor), was also revealed. Pengye's anti-communist activities are organized and planned, the means are extremely insidious and spicy, and there are many people who wear his crotch with him. \\nAt the time of wage reform last year, Peng Ye took advantage of the grievances of some people in the Senate about the rating, ignited everywhere and launched a rampant attack on the party. Pengye was rated 16, and he refused to receive compensation, and instigated others not to receive compensation. And fabricated rumors that Wang Lian was crying, spitting blood and fainting at home for the purpose of rating, trying to incite the masses and even collecting 'materials' everywhere, and gathered some people to hold secret meetings and plan how to attack the party. Later, the United Front War Department asked him to talk. After talking to Deputy Minister Chung, he carried out a vicious personal attack on Comrade Zhong Hua everywhere. 'All those who rated 16 have political history problems,' he fabricated a rumor. The Senate had a 16 rating of 2/3, and he tried to provoke these people's dissatisfaction with the party. Peng Ye, under the guise of helping the party to rectify the wind, said that 'the Communist Party is better than the Kuomintang'; and has vigorously defamed and slandered the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee and the United Front Department; put forward the slogan 'political freedom, organize independence' against the leadership of the Communist Party; visited Hankou last year to visit the Soviet Union The exhibition hall, he published lengthy anti-Communist fallacy against his friends in an attempt to bring the history of the Communist Party leading the people's revolution Clipping. In the struggle meeting of the People's Revolution, everyone rightly refuted Peng Ye's shameless statement. It was also reported that he had done an anti-Communist anti-people long time ago. He joined the Chinese Police Institute in 1944, has ties with the Military Unification and Restoration Society. When he was a pseudo-police chief in Qiyang in 1946, he was in collusion with the military service chief Yi Jingxiang, and joined Al-Shabaab in 1948. He participated in the Civil Revolution because of the relationship between the anti-revolutionary Zhou Yixiang, who was arrested shortly after liberation. They also pointed out that Li Maoqiu, Yuan Boxie, Wang Guoyuan, and Peng Ye wear crotch pants; pointed out that Pengye had close contacts with right-wing elements Chen Yuxin, Chou shuofu and so on. \\nAt present, anti-right struggle organized by the provinces and municipalities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is yet to be further deepened. (The New Hunan Newspaper, August 11, 1957, the original title, 'The anti-right struggle of the Democratic Revolution has made preliminary progress, Chou shuofu and other issues, Liu Yuehou is still resisting, and Peng Ye's reactionary activities have been revealed')"

				"memoirContent": "【Attached】Zhou Li: 'Zhiqing beauty Qiao juncheng Xianhua' (forbidden smell network/Shi Hai hook sink)\\nIn winter 1957, Fuling snow was great, Qiao juncheng Xianhua, only 3 years old, always remembered the flying snow. A group of people cried 'to pull out the counter-revolutionary Qiao juncheng Juncheng', rushed into the house and dragged his dad outside the door. There are no other people in the family, small Xianhua scared in the corner, and trembling. Dad who was dragged to the door suddenly broke out, ran back to the house and put her daughter tight in his arms, tightly clung her face with tears, eagerly said: 'Yatou, no matter what happens, you have to remember that Dad is not a counter-revolution, Dad is playing the Japanese devils...' did not finish, Dad was dragged again Go. \\nIn the snow, small Xianhua crying all the way to catch up, has been chased to Fuling area shelter. 'I saw them hung their dad backhand, hit with a stick, and dad made a bleak cries. I don't dare to look down, I can only run to find my mother.' In the evening, Dad was dragged back to the ground by several people, blurred with flesh and snowflakes on messy hair. Dad said 'I'm not' he broke his breath. After understanding, her mother Zhou Weiqing told her that his father was graduated from the Huangpu military school, was an officer of the KMT, and had played Japanese devils on the battlefield. \\n'The next days can be described as dark days, where people go chasing us to 'kill a little counter-revolution', no baby wants to play with us. When opening a fight, mother's chest hung 'counter-revolutionary family' black card, standing on stage, low head, someone under the stage from time to time spit to her, throwing small stones, she dared to avoid. We cry under the stage do not dare to speak. Every time I come back at a meeting, Mom says to me, 'Remember, even if someone spits his mouth on your faces, do not say anything, and it's just wiping it yourself. Learn to be strong in patience! '' \\nAfter the age of 3, Qiao juncheng Xianhua began to be afraid of snow, afraid of snow days. Carrying the notorious anti-revolutionary dog cubs, Qiao juncheng Xianhua spent a humiliating childhood in patience. \\nOn December 22, 1968, Mao Zedong issued an important directive: 'Knowledge young people go to rural areas and receive re-education from poor farmers.' Qiao juncheng Xianhua, who was attending a physical school, did not wait for the mobilization, took the initiative to apply to the difficult Longtan District. She is the youngest of those young people. 'I was only 15 years old that year, and I was still a minor, as now said. I want to take the opportunity to show how distinctive I want to break with the bourgeois, and hopefully others will change their perception of us.' \\nOn February 8, 1969, Qiao juncheng Xianhua and other educated youth set out together at Fuling Lighting Stadium, grass green military uniform with a belt, wearing Chairman Mao's statue on his chest, and a military satchel printed 'Rooted in the countryside dry revolution'. Everyone holds a red treasure book, shouting slogans to the countryside. Qiao juncheng Xianhua inserted team in Longtan District Taiping People's Commune Revival Team 6th production team (now Qingyang Town, Fuling District, Xinyuan Village 6 team). There is 90 kilometers from Fuling city, looking at a glance, except the mountains or mountains. \\nAfter arriving at Taiping, local elementary school students met them, and villagers showed a special passion for the beautiful Qiao juncheng Xianhua. In December 2006, local villager Lee Shun Zhen was still impressed by Qiao juncheng Xianhua 37 years ago: 'We look at her like a fairy. At that time there was a pretty female educated youth, nicknamed 'Taiping flower'. But it is recognized that Qiao juncheng Xianhua is more beautiful, everyone calls her 'race Taiping.' Because he can sing and dance, Qiao juncheng Xianhua quickly became the literary and artistic backbone of the propaganda team. She has never enjoyed this kind of courtesy at the age of 15. She was very pleased, felt that the green road was right, and was determined to step down to receive the re-education of poor farmers. However, good days have not passed a month, because her black five status was debunked. \\nQiao juncheng Xianhua participated in the labor, excitement to go back, meet the production captain on the road. The captain said: 'I thought you were Dragon is Phoenix, and now I knew that you were a counter-revolutionary dog mixed into the revolutionary team. I want to let poor farmers regulate you well!' Only then Qiao juncheng Xianhua knows how naive the initial idea, family composition this thing is like genetic genes. No matter how you pursue progress, it is in vain! \\nQiao juncheng Xianhua dreamed of being a singing dancer and dancing with dance shoes. She still insists that she gets up every morning at 6 o'clock, sneak to the hillside behind the house-gently, do not dare to let go of her throat. \\nThe farthest field of the production team is at the foot of the mountain. It will take two hours one way to go home. She worked hard, called 'roll a mud, make a red heart'. She was deeply afraid that her face was not dark enough, and the calluses on her hands were not thick enough to show how he supported the 'combination with workers and farmers' road. \\nThe first time up the mountain cut firewood, a knife down, Qiao juncheng Xianhua suddenly felt a cool left arm, lift his hand, a green snake wrapped in the arm. She did not dare to call out, afraid that others curse her as Miss KMT. For the first time underground transplanted rice, crawling grasshoppers on the 'Some are drilling in the meat. I was scared of death, but only quietly pulled out. Broken, get full of legs is blood. I hold back nausea and do not dare cry out. Later, still kindly villagers taught me, first hand shoot, wait for the mangou loose mouth and then tear.' \\nHard work day, Qiao juncheng Xianhua can earn up to 7 points, while other educated green dry day is 8 points. Other educated youth can divide six or seven hundred pounds of grain in a year, and she has less than 300 pounds. Others occasionally have meat to eat, Qiao juncheng Xianhua does not, her meat tickets are often 'substituted' by other educated youth. All this, nobody dares to speak openly for her because she is a black five class dog cub. \\nIt is also the reason to blame for being beautiful. At first, Qiao juncheng Xianhua dressed avant-garde, when other girls wear loose cotton tops, she wears a shirt, but also tied in pants, showing a moving figure. These are also used as examples of the serious bourgeoisie minds. \\n'Others treat me as a corrective labor prisoner, and anyone can scold at my nose. This life is more difficult than childhood discrimination. Before, after all, there was a mother around, can talk, not lonely. But I remember my mother's words and learn to be strong in patience.' \\nIn the winter of 1970, Heilongjiang Military Region song and dance troupe to Taiping condolences. Qiao juncheng Xianhua, who is the backbone of the propaganda team, has shown his talent in cooperation with them to subdued the cabaret leadership. The song and dance group intended to call her into the group, but was unable to do so because of composition problems. She also did not fight, and she knew that her own identity was not eligible to fight for it. \\nIn winter 1972, several male youth in the team stole a piece of brown sugar at a nearby affiliate store. There are members who pursue progress reported Qiao juncheng Xianhua is complicit. No matter how she explains, nobody believes what this counter-revolutionary offspring has said. For a week in a row, she was asked to go to the team every day after work to receive education for poor farmers. When the poor farmers are tired of education, she can return to her residence 10 miles away at night alone. \\nOn the way back to the accommodation, go through a pond. This evening, Qiao juncheng Xianhua sat on the mud ground, looking at the dark pool water, allowing snow and rain to hit the face. Lianglong, she looked for an abandoned disc stone tied to the body, slowly towards the heart of the pool...\\nWhen she woke up, Qiao juncheng Xianhua lay on a villager's bed. Shabby Tsuchiya could not cover the winds whistling outside the house, but she felt particularly warm. Villager Tian Mengchi saved her. Tian family composition is not good, is the landlord. 'My girlgirl, we are all poor people, do not do stupid things in the future.' Tian mother Xu-chun caressed Qiao juncheng Xianhua's face, distressed that she was a dry daughter. Thinking of the dying of his father and mother's love, Qiao juncheng Xianhua once again mustered the courage of life. \\nOn December 6 this year, Qiao juncheng Xianhua returned to Taiping. This is the first time she returned to her place in more than 20 years after her return to town. Back to this mountain village for 8 years, Qiao juncheng Xianhua tears sprinkled all the way. Mountains or those mountains, but the things are human and wrong. After 17 years after the death of dry mother Xu Chunhuai, failing to return to run a funeral for the elderly, became her life's guilt. She insisted on going to the dry mother's grave. Dry mother buried in Tangya mouth, Qiao juncheng Xianhua cried in front of the grave, until the incense candle burned."

Zhang Qiao duo communication excerpt: December 6, 1956 Zhang to Qiao's letter said: 'Back to Zhangjiakou for many days, door to string, only to know a family, a day is not as good as a day. The hardship of life is unprecedented. Household households shouted, some shouting, in fact, the same. People are not bored, desperate, every day... looking for your bitter reading success... for our Yellow River youth to fight for a breath, par with the multi-brain youth.' On June 3, 1957, Qiao addressed a letter to Zhang said: 'The tianjin whole wind movement has emerged, my college students spontaneously get up, the party committee lags behind the thoughts of the classmates and get busy... our way to the whole wind is the big print newspaper... to expose their ugly facts. Now the number of sheets posted on the walls of the hospital is hundreds. Many words in the big print are very intense, saying what ordinary classmates dared to say... I also posted two big print newspapers at first, very dull content. Usually they rarely touch them, do not understand the insider, and can not hit the key. In the future, the students themselves took up and set up a contested group. I tried to unite all my classmates and let them lead the whole house's activities. But a reflection of the facts is not as easy as imagination. What about the consequences of leadership? It is also worth considering. Therefore, I did not do that on my own passionate time. My intention now is to learn in silence, and to fight for what we want to get-freedom of thought in speech. I also intend to organize a literary community about a few classmates, but there are too few like-minded people and I'm trying to find friends.' It is a matter of rule that right-wing elements move from political thought to organizing activities into counter-revolutions. Meanwhile, in rampant attacks by right-wing elements against the party, hidden counter-revolutionaries cannot fail to take part in their activities. We therefore believe that, at an advanced stage of the anti-right struggle, investigations must be intensified with a view to further clearing the counter-revolution in the fight against the right. The Provincial Committee intends to include the public security departments to participate in the leadership group in order to strengthen counter-efforts in the fight against the right.

After the reform of the currency system, prices have risen somewhat, and some explanations are not reasonable, such as the need for greater than production, people's lives are improved, supply is inadequate, and the acquisition of care for by-products has increased the acquisition price. I don't think the supply of goods is not a reason to raise prices, because we do not necessarily adjust the phenomenon of artesian snapping with the laws of supply and demand. Like this year's shrimp, never fell, always 0.9 yuan, can be interpreted as export, do not set the formula that purchasing power has increased, in fact, the purchasing power of each person is reduced. Life has not improved after salary increases, although good is not a sincere word, so people can not obey. (Panel presentation on 29 May)\\n2. The rural visit came back to know that farmers eat bran, bran noodles. Pay attention to whether there is too much export in the food acquisition policy, and the national reserves should be considered, otherwise it is impossible to do so. China's 600 million people have not had a lot of grain surplus, but because of the struggle with nature yet has not had a lot of power, basically eat on the day. The ancient notes have a cloud of 'Yu has nine years of water, soup has seven years of drought, and the country has no donation, forgot to accumulate, and have it first.' Note that it is difficult for such a large country to rely on foreign relief in case of famine. It should be considered whether it is appropriate to publicize the reference to China's abundance of clothing and food. (panel presentation on 24 May)\\nII. Views on Party leadership and communist organization\\n1. Some of our mistakes are related to the central government, such as Xi Zhongxun's report on handling letters from the people, and the State Council does not handle the letters from the people well, and the theory is out of practice. (panel presentations on 3 June)\\n2. 'Knowing leadership intentions' is an unhealthy, afraid of responsibility. Intent can be said in words, books in paper. Apart from this, there should be no other intention, and now often leaders do not say specific, the following is done right, saying they can appreciate the intent of leadership, and when something happens, he can't appreciate the intention of leadership. It makes some people who have an incorrect style of begging and flattering, fearing to experience the intention of the wrong leadership. Leaders also like this set, forming some small circles, sheltering each other, and their status wages are also cared for. \\nWhen countries lead professions, they tend to hear that 'leadership is behind reality' or 'behind the masses'. In fact, for several years, the central government has generally made calls and instructions after making calls and instructions. However, people often think that the call made by the central government is timely. Some of these statements belong to the singing of meritorious morality. For example, there is an inappropriate proportion of the pace of industrialization, and the difficulties encountered in practice require correction. Correction is, of course, necessary. The situation is different, and everything is measured by the present, and it is wrong to say that everything is wrong. Of course, everything is not realistic. The dialectics of these aspects are of a high level of dialectics. \\n4. Confucianism called heart, slim, homogeneous rule, peaceful truth, after liberation always descended. In fact, this is a human law, can not be sincerely, slim, homey people, if talking about governing the country, flat world is unthinkable. To govern the country and to calm the world, on the one hand, the courage to defeat the enemy (revolution), on the other hand, love the people (united war, industrial and agricultural union). Sincerity, slim fit, Qi home is nothing more than love the people's basic morals. It is really called the people as expensive, and the junks are light. This is true for the enlightened men of the feudal era, in the case of communists. In this way, you can enter the communist society of 'the world is public', and achieve 'a trip to the road, the world is public, choose and be able to talk about mercy, so that people are not alone relatives, not only their sons, so that the old, young care, widows and widows are alone with the disabled.' Party members don't understand this truth, that is, the party is impure. \\n5. In the past, some organizations used to say to people in movements, 'You believe in the organization, organizations trust you.' This argument makes sense, but when deviations occur, there is some causal upside down, and in the case of a leader, first of all, the so-called 'morality of morality and honesty' should be done first. Understanding these two sentences is not only to follow the good temptation, to convince people, treat people openly, this is not enough in many organs. \\nIII. Perspectives on Communist Party Members\\n1 Communist Party members have experienced style, this wind is sometimes virtuous, sometimes it is a disadvantage, such as making mistakes to senior party members, and the party secretary bag down is the shortcomings. If the High Assistant Minister summarizes this situation in such cases, is there any shortcomings in the central percentage of repudiation? \\n2. Strengthening the rule of law does not necessarily mean merely guaranteeing personal freedom, while at the same time denying him freedom to those who undermine the rule of law. Again, ask non-party personnel to help the party to rectify the wind and catch the wind? Again asked Minister Liu, the report of the General Assembly said that it would never capture the wind, did the wind capture in the end? \\n3. Marxinism has a high degree of prestige among the people, but it is idealism to say that party members are patriots. Those who loved the people in the past succeeded, but those who did not love the people would not succeed. Li Zicheng was a peasant revolution, and he killed many people, so the people did not love him. He was a bad revolutionist, and his drama suggested less. \\n4. I think the party group is a big wall, but there are two small walls, one between senior party members, cadres and general party members, and the other between the masses trusted by the party and the backward masses. (22 May panel statement). \\n5. Now the power style is also very serious. This has a causal relationship with sectarianism. Understanding one thing should also ask whether it is party members or the masses. This is related to the style of leadership, thus also forming part of the power style of general service staff. The leadership should self-check, such as Bao Guobao in the past when he was in the ASAC Give himself a car, but he doesn't sit. (panel presentation on 22 May)\\n6. In 1952, when the transfer and allocation of houses was the northeast cadres who took care of more, there were fewer cadres in North China, because Secretary Cheng was from the Northeast. (Panel presentation on 27 May)\\n7. Assistant Minister Cheng has many drawbacks. Chief Jiang should be very clear, but also does not stop, whether it is afraid of promotion being affected. This point is more hopeful in the future that Director Jiang will pay attention to all work for justice and will have more prestige to the masses. \\n8. Divorce over the years has been many, and many have occurred among members of the Communist Party. Chen Shimei does not recognize his ex-wife. Qin chao Xianglian's play should be singled out, and can be turned into strength for women to fight for freedom. (29 May panel presentations)\\n9. It is not right to negate the moral culture of the past four thousand years. It is suggested that the party should educate members of the middle and lower levels of ethics. This is not retro, but rather good for work. Moral education includes Zhongxiaoren love and righteousness and shame, and three from four German also need to know, daughter Scripture can also read a reading. (panel presentation on 3 June)\\n10. Such things as Chen Shimei did not recognize his ex-wife, suggested strict law enforcement. In the past, sectarianism, senior cadres sheltered each other, if the masses knew that he had no credibility long ago. Senior cadres are enforcing law play, sheltering each other, and cannot educate party members. (panel presentation on 5 June)\\n11. cadres who do not recognize their ex-wives have been divorced, please note the statistics of the Party Committee, there are many members of the party, the masses; there are many senior cadres, and there are many general staff. Lawful of this group of people who are divorced, the city's lesbians know that you marry after the divorce, that is to praise your fame. If your status decreases, such as the head of division, she will also divorce you. To call for young people to choose targets depends on political quality. However, some big cadres are there to abandon their ex-wives and pick up fertilizers. What is the reason? \\nIV. Perspectives on cadre policy and salary policy\\n1. I hear that there are dozens of non-party directors and deputy directors of local authorities in Beijing, and look at the power sector, I'm afraid that even a non-party director can't find it, but rather all. Even if so, I am afraid that there is no right to be responsible, and there is now a widespread problem of lack of competence. Are non-party cadres untalented and unvirtuous? This is not actually the case. \\n2. Non-party cadres either have a function or have no authority or responsibility, or they have the right to be responsible, or they are not competent. Party members and cadres either have the right and responsibility, or they have no right or responsibility, or they have the right or no responsibility, no competence or no responsibility, no duty, no right or no responsibility. \\nThe level of 'Professional' within the Department was created at the time of the assessment of salaries in 1952 in order to alleviate the situation. It was suggested that the State should establish an examination system and that new standards should be applied to standards of meritocracy and morality. (Panel presentation on 29 May)\\n4. I believe that the only solution to this problem (referring to cadre selection), is to reconsider the criteria of virtue and merit in the selection of personnel. On the issue of Germany, we should conduct a comprehensive analysis of each individual's personalism, style, patriotic thinking, and the concept of life. In short, Marxism-Leninist culture. On the issue of talent, there should be a comprehensive analysis of each individual's knowledge, experience, work ability, and even the necessary selection of examination systems. In short, it should be done: not Eloch selfish, meritorious, not by the official to love, who can be the place. Not to abolish his son with his father's sins (Gun and Yu Xing), not with one wrath. Leadership reviews of subordinates should also be frequent and meticulous. \\n5. The manifestations of sectarianism in wages are quite serious. The increase in the wages of party members is indicative of sectarianism. The party has sectarianism, as reported in the blackboard newspaper a few days ago, pulled down if they have opinions about the masses in the assessment, and not pulled down on party members. (Panel presentation on 7 June)\\nV. Perspectives on intellectual-policy and ideological transformation\\n1. There have been some changes in intellectual-policy, but there are problems in practice. The genesis of sectarianism lies in the central government. After the three and the counter-parties, the replacements of democratic personalities were all started by the Central Committee. I have the same views on the comments of Chuanping. (panel presentation on 3 June)\\n2. Industrial and agricultural cadres have more general sentiment that they are reluctant to approach intellectuals. Of course, intellectuals are not very close to industrial and agricultural cadres. In the end, there are more responsibilities in that area. It can be concluded by the Party. I think that the workers and cadres of the Labour and Agriculture Party are more responsible. \\n3. In the past, the intellectuals were overvalued, not allowed to make a whim, talk about state affairs is counter-revolution, in fact, show revolt, three years not. (panel presentation on 22 May)\\n4. thought work called people to expose thought, superior criticism and come up as a typical. Thought work should be meticulous, and this style is holding a stick to find direction to fight, a stick to kill others. (Panel presentation on 27 May)\\nVI. Perspectives on the whole wind movement and vigorous exercise\\n1. Today, the party is very necessary, and it is not right to split up from past movements. A number of people were killed in the past movements, after liberation, and a lot of fights, and agreed that Mr. Lorongi proposed to set up a 'rehabilitation committee'. In the past class struggles, most of the people's internal contradictions have been included, and many internal contradictions have been created. Therefore, the 'three countervails' and 'rebellion' should be completely repudiated. (panel presentation on 3 June)\\n2. After the whole wind, the People's Daily still has sectarianism, such as Li Kangnian raises the question of fixed rates, just add a question mark after the title. It is sectarianism that the wall is to be demolished in two ways, and it is labeled with a large title. This may cause the concerns of the spokesperson, and it is also being magnified, and everyone will rebutt the wrong place, and do not have to aroust from the title. (panel presentation on 3 June)\\n3. This time, the Party was windy and rain, and in the past all non-party personnel were rampant storms, which was unfair. The Central Committee said that not to pill cold water to activists. What do activists refer to? What do activists mean, it is not considered to be positive. (panel presentation on 5 June)\\n4 this time some party members are unclear, such as Tang, leather incident revealed a bad man and bad thing, and party members are unclear. As the leader on the shortcomings of the old Dong mentioned, the rest of comrades rarely raised. We feel that party members, such as Bai, Jiang and Kang, Assistant Minister Cheng know better than us, but rarely put forward their views. Gentlemen love to Germany, whether party members love people not to be virtuous, appeasement is wrong, suggesting that the Party Committee strengthen education. Before Chairman Mao made a report on the issue of internal contradictions among the people, it seemed peaceful, and it was not. If it is a peaceful world, it should be thought that the Chinese people have a sense of contentment and can ninja self-safety, this has played a great stabilizing role for the general masses. In the past, there were some words in my heart, but dare not to say, afraid to hit a stick. This time, it is necessary for some party members to set fire there. Chairman Mao didn't see it burned up early. If not, then the fire was lurking. This time, not only educated Party members but also educated Chairman Mao, and gave all party members a The most vivid political class should be thoroughly awake. In the past, the Annunciation was not worried. There were some bad phenomena. Chairman Mao could not necessarily know, and suggested that the party should pay attention to this situation in its organization. There are some bad things that only senior party members know, subordinate do not know, but some party members also don't say, what is this reason. \\n5. The People's Daily published some of the opinions of democratic people about the wind. Some people think it is good to say, I think this reasoning is very simple, why is it biased to want to pull the back of the Communist Party. Chairman Mao has always made the whole wind better than treating people. When I asked a doctor to see a doctor, did any doctor point to the patient and said, 'You are too passionate except for serious stomach problems.' Of course, it is two things to evaluate the party and help the party to rectify. Evaluation of the party can come to a method of physical examination. But if someone can't find the party's shortcomings, then he cannot necessarily say the shortcomings. This time the party welcomes me to participate in the whole wind, give opinions and criticism. The whole wind is a cure to save people, then there must be a doctor. We participate in the whole wind like doctors, in fact, there are Western medicine, Chinese medicine, quacks. Western medicine may be more powerful, Chinese medicine may be eased, quack doctors often have to put people to death. I do not want to be a quack doctor, although I do not have access to medical care, but I do it again? Only some panacea 'with nicillin', 'anti-inflammatory tablets', 'soda tablets'. So it may be symptomatic to eat, just take care of matters, maybe not, but never kill people. Because I don't want to sing praise here to do some false morality. \\n6. Party members of the past movements also hurt some people's hearts. To see corruption is absolute, such as living well is embezzlement, living out of poverty is impoverished, and cannot be conscientious. And, like expelling someone, say, 'usurp the leadership.' Nor can it be agreed that some of the suicides in the movement are said to be suicidal, and 90 per cent of the suicides are innocent. (panel presentation on 3 June)\\n7. The manner in which several campaigns were disagreeable. For example, if the target of the public trial assembly is not a true crime, then it is inappropriate for the masses to have a snow bright eye. In fact, the people go with you, where the snow is bright? The masses were covered there saying the snow was bright, and the deviation was on it. (Panel presentation on 29 May)\\n8. It is bad for the social climate to say that someone is bad, an anti-revolutionary, and that the masses never discern it, and the strengthening of the rule of law is necessary. (3 June presentation at the panel)\\n9. Leaders in the movements think to fight whoever will fight whoever. If in Tianjin, I reflected some opinions to the Party branch, that is, we have committed to attacking and defending the alliance. This is no longer a reflection of the situation, for example, dozens of examples. (presentation at the panel on 31 May)\\n10. Non-party people can say that they have frightened the courage of the past movements, and they will be 'whole' if they are completely unable to get up to the side. Since it was decided to be complete, then the attitude of calm and honest, that is to say, 'muddled and falsely sedative', and a hurry attitude is said to be 'panic and panic'. If a non-party person in the leadership position is rectified, that is, 'usurped leadership'; people who can not withstand the waves commit suicide, say, 'serious evil, fear,' 'Sin suicide'. Good for a good person, who is alive for fear that he will not die, and he is afraid he will remain fond of death, have to give him a 'stinky years'. This method and pragmatism are completely contrary to the requirement of 'treat people with sincerity', and this kind of person who defends the prestige of the country's best to pay the judgements, exactly what is the reason. I would like to suggest that the party start reading some classics, history and literature on old morals for intermediate party members. \\n11. The main reason why criticism and self-criticism cannot be carried out is the disconnection between theory and practice. We tend to say that 'acknowledging shortcomings is the greatest prestige', but in fact there are places where this is not done. This shortcoming exists in the higher party and political organs, which I think also exists. Knowing mistakes is not always so painful, speaking is not too simple, surely the results are always so comprehensive. On the other hand, in terms of the promotion of democracy, how to speak out is paramount. The ancient language is called 'a saint forbidden by the sage who cannot be honest with the people.' On the issue of broad talk, in the past, it has not been done enough, emphasizing positions, hard snapping hats, and even the phenomenon of 'defamation by the foreword'. Waiting for the movement, it is the result of some leaders who think they are self-righteous and misunderstood 'prestige'. Of course, we must oppose defamation, but we must not confuse factual criticism or opinions to the party and politics with defamation... for example, the three, five counter, anti-counter, and rebellion, agree that it is a good thing, but because the leadership leads the masses with subjectivity and dogmatism, the result has come to work. The Communist... this prestige... the damage it causes is incalculable if it is buried at a moment or is stolen for the purpose of personal 'glorification' of certain middle and lower personnel. The word 'prestige' has prevailed in the past with vulgar understandings and practices, believing that power over all is prestige, and therefore there is also a subjective approach to building authority.

Away from the hustle and bustle of the city, life has a little bit of fun. Take a break to buy your favorite confectionery, candy, canned food, tobacco and alcohol and daily necessities, or go to the post and email agency to see if you have a letter from loved ones. In a relaxed environment, everyone is happy to forget, everyone looks forward to good labor in exchange for the release of labor re-education, return to normal life. But the day is unpredictable. In the days of three red flags flying, after Marshal Peng Dehuai was hit as a right-wing political storm, people's good hopes turned into a bubble, and the farm situation is worsening under the influence of the far left route. Because of the shortage of supplies, the commissary disappeared quietly. Correctional personnel must send letters openly for management cadres to check the offspring, and no one knows exactly if they do not send them. The letter at home is also the recipient after inspection. The lack of freedom of communication and the difficulty of telling the truth among loved ones exacerbates the mental suffering on both sides. The money sent from the home cannot be saved. It is all managed by cadres, and cannot be freely accessed, and they are expecting money to sigh and bitter. In order to prevent the destruction of class enemies, the farm was stationed in PLA and increased vigilance around the farm. The teams have strengthened the control of their lives, they must not be noisy in the work shed, can not run teams to find acquaintances to chat at rest. Unleashed on the site must first shout report, obtain the permission of the team captain before acting. Captain Li is particularly harsh, restricting stool time. People who exceed the time limit due to gastrointestinal discomfort have difficulty in defecation will be abused. In some cases, an unresponsive patient kicked and sat on a pile of shit. During the break break, it was stipulated to stay on their own narrow work surface, not to go beyond the minepool one step, and the punishment of ancient land was imposed. According to those who have served their sentences in the labour force, they have never seen such indiscriminate aggressors in the labour force."

				"memoirContent": "【Attached】Qin deyu Deyu: 'Review of Sandwich Groove Reeducation Farm' (Zhao Xu 'Anti-Right Movement Sandwich Ditch Survivors Testimonial' Taiwan Show Wei News 2014)\\nI am the only son of the three fathers, loved by my family since childhood. During the anti-Japanese war, the policy of the Kuomintang stipulated that telecommunications technicians were exempted from military service. So after I graduated from Zhiguo High School in Lanzhou City, my fathers and boys urged me to be admitted to the training courses for staff members of the Northwest Training Corps of the Eighth War Area at that time. After graduation assigned to Lanzhou Telecom Bureau as cable clerk. Was retained after the liberation of Lanzhou on August 26, 1949, and worked hard for several years. From the end of 1957 to the spring of 58, late in the anti-right movement of this unit, the leadership mobilized ordinary employees to give hearts to the Party. I responded positively to the call and honestly put my non-proletarian thoughts and the sense of bourgeois deep in the so-called soul. No critical education has been given to the party and no questions have been raised by the organization. Until August 24, the Bureau's party committee leader asked me to talk to me, not to submit the matter of my heart, just said that I went to the farm to participate in labor exercise and explain that up to six months would be able to return to work. I am pleased to express my willingness to travel. \\nMy love, Zhang Jiulan, was an accountant at the Hongqi Machinery Factory in Lanzhou, and was seriously responsible for his work. Political progress had been made actively. It was approved by the Qilihe District Committee to join the Party. She encouraged me to work well and strive for good results. Early in the morning of August 26, I was excited to say goodbye to my parents and left my wife and children, carrying my luggage to the unit. The Party appointed a cadre in the Labour and Personnel Section to lead me out, because my heart is very practical, so I don't ask where to go, just follow. Only after getting on the train, the cadre said: the farm is in Jiuquan, where we should seriously transform the mind and strive for good results in order to facilitate future work. I am still unrestrained, very optimistic, talk about the brilliant future. Get off at Gaotai County West Wutong Spring Railway Station. This cadre is familiar with the situation here, and he has passed here several times by escorting the right. At that time, the car on the farm was waiting for us. Listen to the driver, it was our unit to make a long-distance phone call.\\nof. Cadres drilled into the cab, I climbed into the big car, the car flew north. An endless desert beach, not a little green. After the car raised the dust fluttered. Close your eyes and listen to whale. Occasionally fluttering the tongue, there is sand tooth. Think poet Wang Changling's poem, 'Desert dust and moon faint', is really refined condensed in front of the Gobi style. \\nAfter completing the process of handing over to the farm correctional unit, the escort cadre returned with a face, the farm cadre cold said: 'This is a reeducation through labor farm. Since your unit has given you the heaviest administrative punishment, you must abide by all the regulations and regulations, and rest assured labor reform.' These few words seem to be pouring cold water at the top of the head, and I argue that when it comes, the unit leader clearly spoke about the exercise for six months, without announcing any punishment. The staff said: We do not know this situation. We only carry out re-education through labor tasks based on the official documents sent by the unit. You can ask this unit for comments. He has repeatedly stressed that only honest transformation is the only way out. At this time, I suddenly realized that my unit, in the name of labor exercise, cheated me to come to the farm to become a re-education element. I was three or four months later than other re-education personnel. It is clear that this unit has taken the number of indicators to accomplish the task. I fell into the abyss of pain. It is even more sad that the family of the company, the fact that his loved one's approval to join the party blows unannounced, the younger son ranks among the top junior high school scores and is not allowed to enter high school. Parents over sixty years old have been battered among the residents, and the whole family was sent to rural areas for suffering. \\nI have been confused by re-education through labour, I have never seen any written basis for re-education through labour, nor have I told the masses that I had any problems. Individuals and their families have been subjected to painful discrimination for the past two decades. After returning from the farm, sincerely requested the organization to explain it. The headline charge for the leadership to send re-education through labor in the file was 'extreme reactionary of thought, after mobilization, not to apply for membership in the party'. This is a great mistake. I am ready to fill out after receiving the application form to join the party. Can this be said to be an extreme reactionary? \\nFortunately, out of the more than 10 people who went to the middle of the whole farm, only I and one surname Li came back alive. In 1960, during the Great Famine, a large number of laborers starved on the farm, which had a bad impact on the society. There were many books and reports. My experience in re-education through labour is now presented later in order to supplement the content of similar books. \\nJiabiangou education farm is located in Jiuquan County Northeast of the Great Wall rural area, West and Qin deyugshui Township adjacent to the North and Yuanyang pool reservoir, east of Gaotai County Badan Jilin desert edge. It was originally a branch of Xinhua's labor farm. There are more than 100 acres of ready-made cultivated land, under the leadership of Zhangye District Labour Reform Bureau. After the arrival of a large number of re-education workers in early 1958, more than 2,000 acres of arable land were reclaimed on the desert beaches, divided into dozens of pieces of fields, 70 acres each. The soil here is the flood beach sand land between the snow alluvial fan of Qilian Mountain, with a great sandy content. Because it is located between the Heihe River and Beida River water system, groundwater reserves are very rich, digging less than two meters under visible water, but because saline bitter water, people and animals can not drink, nor is it conducive to crop growth, so each large piece of arable land on both sides must dig deep digging ditches, the project is huge and difficult. The irrigation system here has a trunk canal, and each cultivated land is connected. Excavation of water canals and groundwork is a huge project. Edible water from the canal, the taste is pure and pollution-free. \\nThe farm has poor traffic and there are no regular roads. From time to time, there are farm cars, cattle carriage to and from Wutong Springs Railway Station to transport materials pick-up personnel. The station has a dedicated telephone connection to the farm and is responsible for serving the proletarian dictatorship. The family members of the re-education through labour force visit prisoners. There is no means of transport to ride after getting off the train, and they only have to walk several dozen miles in the desert and desert beaches. Winter season risked such as a knife cut wind sand and snow, frozen trembling, tough steps. Summer days have to step on hot grilled gravel, stifling hot air, dry mouth, sweat. People in the hot sun under the majesty, who can not look forward to the heavenly hush, feel the Yuanqu of the horse Zhiyuan make the famous sentence 'Broken people in the world' sorrow. Even worse, watch out for dust storms and wolves from time to time. But thinking about the safety of their loved ones, all this difficult and dangerous prevent\\nThe white haired elderly and physically and mentally tired young women risked to go to the farm. \\nThe farm under the leadership of the Party Committee has a director and deputy director. There are four administrative, management, education and production units, as well as medical clinics. There are only more than 20 official cadres who manage labor production, ideological education and life chores of nearly 3,000 re-education personnel. There is a serious shortage of manpower. Therefore, the cadres at the county level who are considered reliable among the re-education through labour force personnel are used as team leaders and adopt the expeditious method of re-education through re-education through re-education through re-education through labour. When some have taken power here, forget their status as re-education through labour and abuse their power, with serious consequences, it is clear from the facts described here. \\nAll re-education personnel are divided into two major organizations of the Agricultural Infrastructure Team and the Agricultural Sideline Team. The former engaged in heavy physical labor such as digging and drainage ditches, repairing drains, leveling land, and so are young people in the middle. Agricultural and sidelines are engaged in light labor, such as spring sowing, autumn harvest field management, irrigation release, planting beets, carrots, onions, melons, poultry livestock, sheep, shoe repair, sewing, etc. Because of the light work, it is all responsible for the elderly and the division of labour among women. The infrastructure team consists of a number of teams, with the team leader leading 60 people, responsible for life management and production learning, and power in one. The agricultural and sidelines are divided into groups according to the type of work. Most of the team leaders are employed persons who remain in the field who are not allowed to return home, but who have to be supervised. \\nThey all have a skill and knowledge of the work they do. Because they have undergone a long period of labour reform, they have a meek character, treat people with courtesy, they do not easily expose their emotions. They rarely blame the personnel in the group, and solve the problem by way of persuasion. \\nIf Soo Rong, the chairman of the shoe repair team, is a person who stayed in the field after reforming labour. He respects and cares for Chen Pi Tak of the same group, and work together to make good work. With this good team leader, Chen escaped the fate of starvation. The team captain of the infrastructure team has exclusive authority within the team, such as carrying out meals, bundling, and confinement. Few official farm cadres have asked the captain of the squad to commit an abusive punishment. What is afraid of being charged with the right leaning charge is themselves. Some small team captains act according to policy, and the staff in charge suffer less, such as Zhao Longnian is a good captain to be praised. He was one of the leaders of the Hexi Underground Party, and after liberation served as a secretary of the Wuwei County Committee and deputy county chief. This person is mild, approachable, well developed and compassionate. In heavy labor without a sound lead, never fingers as supervisors. A sick person who does not complete the task he helps to do, never rebuke rebuke or, like other small captains, often punishes eating. Due to his good morality infection, the whole team tried to complete the task automatically, and comfortably make good production. Some small captains, when rations are scarce, give the good thing of licking the barrels to be enjoyed by people who are good at a flattering, while Zhao Longnian always gives the good thing to the weak. Personality is not insulted, so the tragedies of the dead occur less than the other teams. This well-managed division of labor has been jealous of the wicked, repeatedly framed to the farm leadership, repeatedly criticized, accused of weak right, but he insists on the principle. If the policy is executed like him, the whole time will certainly save a lot of lives, but there are too few small captains like this. \\nIncidentally, a captain of Li surname opposite Zhao Yanxing. This person was very arrogant at the beginning of the fight against the right. It was a stupid thing to curse with a dialect book to the leaders of the provincial and municipal post and telecommunication offices. The only thing I was was, I was After getting to the sandwich gutter farm, because there were acquaintances at the labor reformation branch, he was on the capital team captain. This position, though small, satisfies the desires of his official, and also gives him the opportunity to play an abusive character. When he opened his mouth to the squad, he scolded, he hit his hands, spitting on the face of a man is common. When someone fainted on the site because of starvation, he did not go to raise a handful, but instead cursed the mother or stmatized with his feet. A person tied up for a day in confinement for the crime of 'attacking the leader' for a little curse of barbarism. Because of starvation poor physical failure to complete production tasks, he used to take a meal to punish, it was really aggravating the suffering. This kind of reversed management, official cadres do not listen to them.\\nThe fear is that he will be blamed and politically risked by right-leaning ideas. \\nSome books talk about the situation of re-education workers living in the nest, that is a matter of Mingshui Farm in Gaotai County. The offices and dormitories of the jiangbiangou farm are all adobe bungalows. Agricultural and sidelines are dispersed in small houses in groups because of their dispersed labour. The members of the infrastructure team work collectively and live in small units in larger bungalows. Dozens of people slept with thick firewood grass. In the middle of the house there is a long earth platform with seated mound on both sides for people to write home letters or write reviews and give materials. There is a mud stove in the room, burning the quality coal produced by Jiuquan, firepower is very strong, so that people from the cold, can also cook wild vegetable debris, is a farm a great German government. Room door hanging ventilated grass curtains, the roof is ventilated everywhere, so there is no risk of gas poisoning. \\nThere are tables and chairs in the cadre's rooms with wooden beds, and there are also senior uniformed fighters who enjoy this special treatment. Chen Shiwei, vice-president of Lanzhou University, director of the provincial museum, Lu Changlin, bacteriologist Liu Fengju, secretary-general of the Provincial Ethnic Affairs Committee, secretary general of the Provincial Ethnic Affairs Committee, and Zhang Zhongzi, old professor of psychology from Northwest Normal College, were compiled into a group, directly led by the field department. They don't work in the field and do some easy chores. Every year when the cadres take to the farm around the Gobi beach, dug more than two meters of old cloxock grass, arms generally thick aged licorice root, and straw hat-like aged dandelion head, piled up on the ground burned ash, known as soil fertilizer. These huge plant rhizomes have grown for years and have played a good role in fixing the gravel, and it is sad to dig them out without a pity! Chen Shiwei once proposed to pay attention to ecological issues and was criticized by cadres as a conservative thought. He had to be chilling. More than a dozen special people are not only treated by the farm, but their families also frequently come to visit, such as Chen Shiwei's wife Zuo Zongqi sitting in a trolley twice a month, each time brings a lot of food, the same group dipped a lot of light, others are sighing. \\nIn the autumn of 1960, I went to repair shoes set shoes, met a thin and melancholy old man, hands hold a few pairs of old shoes, to the shoe repair team leader Soo Rong said: 'These old shoes can also be worn, thrown into the garbage strange, give to people without shoes to wear it!' I left at a glance. Obviously, this is not willing to say anything to my stranger, how careful and careful he lives! When I was touched by his benevolent heart, the numb mind was difficult to calm. I asked the shoemaker Chen Pi-de about the situation of old Mr.. Chen Ru said: He is a professor at Northwest Normal College, a renowned psychologist Zhang Zhongzi and author of the first set of books in China's university series of psychology. His works have been translated and published in various foreign languages. He rigorously governed, did not ask politics. The anti-right movement did not make a statement, only because he wrote a letter to warn his son not to speak anything detrimental to the party, so that those designated as extreme right were sent to re-education through labour. He loved the poems, and at one time he heard his head singing the poem of King Lo Bin 'In Prison Ching Cicada', 'No one believes Gao Jie, who gives the heart' to express his innocence. He has a strong self-esteem, can not endure the humiliation of his personality, his body is becoming increasingly weak, and his family continues to receive food, but he has failed to save his life. He unconsciously fell into a political trap, causing a tragedy in life, and it is very sad! \\nInfrastructure team personnel sometimes go out for other tasks. In 1958, hundreds of people were sent to the mines near the Yuanyang Pond reservoir to back and back manganese ore. Departure at three o'clock in the morning, reach out to five fingers, and the brigade personnel are led by workers employed after re-education. There are no ready-made roads, in the Gobi beach looking ahead in the big direction, stumbling and walking very slowly. Some people were stumbled by the shuttle, followed by someone fell on him, shouting laughter and scolded into a piece. Some people were touched by stones, hurting shouting 'Mom'. Meet the sand Wo legs are not moving, tired sweat, inch walking difficult. \\nSeeing the flashing green light spot in the distance, then in the sand pile even crawling forward, afraid of lagging behind feeding the wolf. Not to say how many wrongs have gone. At 10 a.m., the brigade personnel arrived. Hastly swallow after eating their own meals, according to the regulations back forty kilograms of ore back to the road. At that time, food was good physical enough, people were also highly motivated, so no one would be back less than the prescribed weight. No tools will each find a way, someone with a rope bundle, someone with a coat bag, and people with two pairs of pants with some gravel. Shoulders together, mighty, spectacular. Only heard everyone gasping, rustling under their feet. A long time will someone tired to shout softly: 'My mom!' \\nWhen the sun was oblique, the passers-by suddenly shouted: 'The wind came, hurry to leave the sandbag to a flat place. Recline back toward the wind. Protect your head and face, don't run around!' Then see the west sky dim, through the sun flashed orange-red. Not many times the wind struck, the sky is dark. Lying down to the ground can not hide the small stones hit face pain, wind sand blows into the ears and nose, breathing is poor, have to cover the nostrils to reduce the hindrance of wind to breathe. There is a feeling of collapse of the wind and sand raging. Meteorological data record the largest wind power in this place can reach level 11, I do not know this wind for several levels, lucky not much time gradually stop, but the sky is still gray and misty can not see the far Qilian mountain. Human body blindfolded a thick layer of sand, only the head on the ground shaking off the dust, and then stood up while shaking the whole body, while digging ears, nose, spitting. Look up around the landscape landscape change, sandbags are gone, low ground fill. Leaders were happy to say: 'No one died, nor lost a person, really lucky, hurry back'. Seeing the farm not far, can not help but joyfully. Some people really do not move, they dragged away on the hard ground, clothes grinding into pieces of cloth are also at the expense. \\nI'm not the last one, but fell behind the brigade, think it would be easy to take a respite to the farm, put the ore on the tucan and rest back. A fierce looked up to see three evil wolves jogging towards me. I rush to solve the ore on the rope, the back clutter. The wolf saw me constantly whirling the rope and formed three sides around the front. Their front legs are upright, butt to the ground, emit fierce light and dare not close in front of the rotating rope. This method of wolf prevention is taught by shepherds near the farm, it is not really practical at this moment. Anyway make all the strength whirl rope, plus the heart nervous sweaty DC. I was boldly heard not far away from the conversation of the team's hard friends. In the middle of the old wolf left, the remaining two also followed away, not far from the wolf did not hesitate to look back. I went out to mum, quickly picked up the ore and walked with my companions. Feet is not painful, the feeling of sleepiness is gone. This time to verify the wolf wolf whirl rope method is effective, but if there are no hard friends coming, then what should be the consequences? Two adventures in a day, thrilling afterwards. \\nThe frost in Jiuquan area comes from September 24 to 27. On 17 September 1959, the farm organized several groups to collect sugar radish, and I participated in a total of seven people. That day coincided with the Mid-Autumn Festival, big stove to improve food, we had lunch in advance, also received dinner, ready to grab in the moonlight at night. \\nA field is far away from the place, so bring a cotton coat overnight. Because the soil here is suitable for planting sugar radish, so the growing tubers are mostly in ten pounds. Due to the large head must be careful to dig so as not to damage. After dinner, the moon was empty, seven people lively work. Suddenly thick clouds, a field of black reach out to five fingers. Because we could not continue to work, everyone had to drill into the existing cellar. This cellar is three meters underground, there are two people side by side access, the cellar can live more than ten people, warm summer and cool winter suitable for overnight. We closed the wooden door and fell back to sleep, due to fatigue immediately snoring, sleep overnight without movement. In the morning, someone looked at the watch said the day is bright why the door seams do not see light? Everyone smelled surprised. Heli push outward shoving, exhausting the valve and the door plate does not move, people face overlooked. Some say it must be the passage collapsed and buried the cellar door, had to go out from the skylights. We take turns on the ladder, dig small ventilation skylights with iron milling, cost a lot of effort to climb the top of the cellar. Looking at all, the earth silver and white, the passage filled with snow, a continuous succession of snowdrifts in the field. The snowdrift is a masterpiece of windy, but also the scenery of Benset. \\nIt was surprising that the snow came so early, and digging radish had to wait for the snow to melt and then dry. \\nBefore talking about the back of ore food good, then the province ran canteen, open belly to eat, sandwich ditch farm is also food to meet the needs of laborers, the infrastructure team's room is a bungalow cottage, eat the belly period, farm leaders also pay attention to active cultural life held several literary and artistic evenings. Many people with expertise on stage, can be called stars brilliant. In the Qin deyuqian Guizhou case, the actor acting as Bao Gong is stable, the look is solemn, clear, the more intense singing, the more intense the singing, the package that is not afraid of the power and severe punishment of evil is marvelous. Peking opera paragraph is also a lot of fun, all won a warm applause. Not only did the fans become addicted, but also as the spring breeze blows the mind, a rejoicing. Especially unforgettable and elegant programs include Ren Guangdi's tenor solo of Ren Guangdi, a music professor at the Northwest School and the allegro book by cadres of the Lanzhou City Cultural Bureau. \\nRen Guangdi singing is strong and loud, wide range, beautiful sound. His singing 'Ode to the Motherland' understage people were deeply infected and whispered, and some had tears of their own political misfortune. The music educator also learned that he was Shandong in labor and chatted with the infrastructure team. He graduated from Shanghai Yinhua Art College in the early 1930s. In the mid-thirties, General Zhang Xueliang ran Wangdong Middle School for the Northeast Army's children in Xi'an and sent a special person to Shanghai to invite him to be a music teacher. He had sang the trilogy of exile for the teachers and students, evoking the homesickness of general Zhang and other people. Someone slipped, and the general also wiped his tears. In that year, Zhang Xueliang was full of strength, he had learned to sing with students songs such as the march and the song of the guerrillas, the sound was bright and pleasant. He also loves to sing Peking Opera section 'Chopping Ma Su' and so on, singing with eyes, showing a versatile Confucian style. Zhang regarded Ren as his own and had invited him to a family banquet. The school's staff were mostly clandestine party members of the CPC. Ren Guangdi's thought was deeply affected. After the double twelve incidents, Wangdong Middle School declined gradually. Ren left the school to Yuquan Guan National Five High School School of Tianshui County, as a music teacher, and was also obliged to teach anti-war songs for several secondary schools in Tianshui, making a certain contribution to the local fiery anti-Japanese propaganda activities. The National Five High School has gathered outstanding teachers from the occupied areas, with high quality teaching, and has cultivated a large number of talents for the country, such as today's Taidou Huo Songlin is one of them. In recent years, the National Fifth High School student records have been distributed at home and abroad, containing Ren Guangdi's resume. The educational community of Lanzhou has a reputation for music teaching achievements. \\nTalking about the allegro book of its sexy elegance, deep connotation, the rich and colorful plot is also rare, very different daily in the allegro interdictions of the vulgar. Listening to his allegro book is an education of history, literature and moral character. The whole allegro book was singing in four gala, really surprisingly long. The beginning of the Lanzhou waterwheel, praise the Ming Chaolian Lanzhou section continued to draw on the Yunnan barrel to create a wooden structure water truck that spinning water on the Yellow River for more than 300 years to benefit people on both sides of the Yellow River, and also praised the feat of using foreign advanced technology in 1906-1908 to build the first iron bridge on the Yellow River in Lanzhou The second allegro said Lishan, praised the 'double twelve' soldiers to resist Japan. Also quoted Du Mu's poem 'A ride on the Red Princess laughing, nobody knows litchi to come', revealing the luxury of the rulers of the feudal era. The third paragraph of the allegro speaks about the magnificent landscape of Dongting Lake, in Yueyang Lou's famous words 'not to be happy, not to be sad', express personal feelings. The fourth paragraph speaks of Chengdu Du Fu Cottage, borrowing the poem of 'Ande Guangzhousha, the world of the world,' to express the pride of building a new society. \\nIn short, Ren Guangdi and Fujun singing shows are of a high level. After the party people talked about the catchy seven-words allegro, all to admire its deep literary mastery, the fine of language art. \\nIn 1958, the right faction of the pensionary ditch farm to get rid of the pain of slander humiliation by the unit, eat full here, also enjoy the joy of literary performances, after labor in the shed to find acquaintances to chat, see the breeze in the sun, or watch the Yi, play poker, listen to the Qin deyu cavity roar, play Young's Huqin played. Away from the hustle and bustle of the city, life has a little bit of fun. Take a break to buy your favorite confectionery, candy, canned food, tobacco and alcohol and daily necessities, or go to the post and email agency to see if you have a letter from loved ones. In a relaxed environment, everyone is happy to forget, everyone looks forward to good labor in exchange for the release of labor re-education, return to normal life. But the day is unpredictable. In the days of three red flags flying, after Marshal Peng Dehuai was hit as a right-wing political storm, people's good hopes turned into a bubble, and the farm situation is worsening under the influence of the far left route. Because of the shortage of supplies, the commissary disappeared quietly. Correctional personnel must send letters openly for management cadres to check the offspring, and no one knows exactly if they do not send them. The letter at home is also the recipient after inspection. The lack of freedom of communication and the difficulty of telling the truth among loved ones exacerbates the mental suffering on both sides. The money sent from the home cannot be saved. It is all managed by cadres, and cannot be freely accessed, and they are expecting money to sigh and bitter. In order to prevent the destruction of class enemies, the farm was stationed in PLA and increased vigilance around the farm. The teams have strengthened the control of their lives, they must not be noisy in the work shed, can not run teams to find acquaintances to chat at rest. Unleashed on the site must first shout report, obtain the permission of the team captain before acting. Captain Li is particularly harsh, restricting stool time. People who exceed the time limit due to gastrointestinal discomfort have difficulty in defecation will be abused. In some cases, an unresponsive patient kicked and sat on a pile of shit. During the break break, it was stipulated to stay on their own narrow work surface, not to go beyond the minepool one step, and the punishment of ancient land was imposed. According to those who have served their sentences in the labour force, they have never seen such indiscriminate aggressors in the labour force. \\nAt the end of 1959 rations 18 pounds a month, the phenomenon of fainting people appeared on the site, people had less effort to work, failure to complete the task became a common phenomenon. Every day of suffering, fainted shock brought to the medical clinic for rescue, not seen to return is common. \\nRations were reduced to eight"

				"memoirContent": " pounds per month in 1960. There is a shell millet, black beans, dried sweet potato, each accounted for a certain percentage. Food substitutes are bitter, dandelion, sand jujube leaves. After a boiled soak to taste, sand jujube leaves are still difficult to swallow. Tonton a pot of broth, salt for a few days is not. All day hungry, gastrointestinal expansion and dilution, disease has long been canceled, halal stove invisibly disappears. Since 1958, the farm harvest is good, so many wheat, melon dishes and radishes. Why didn't you supply it in 1960? \\nThe rightists have only to think about their hearts and worry about the crisis of survival they face every day. \\nLiquor plus brown sugar after burning heat is a one-way treatment for pulling the stomach. I bought a pound of bottled liquor before the sale was cancelled, in case of occasional need. I ate food for rarity, and I took out of the box liquor secretly drank a bite, which known the wine scent fluttered, attracted full view, some people also cast begging eyes. I clenched the bottle of contemplation for a moment after a heart declared me a guest, the same room hard friend each drink a small bite. Immediately in the dull work shed, the low laughter that has not been heard for a long time. The sleepy man came out of his nest to look at me, and one was dancing on the ground and fell. When orderly delivery of bottles of small drinks do not fight, nor see the greedy and drink people, which proves the high level of culture. Wait until the bottom of the sky each person's nose against the empty bottle mouth massively inhale smell wine smell, ah exits long breath. Finally fill the bottle with water, a few fought to drink. But joy is just a sudden, after singing the drunk shed again to death generally silence. \\nEveryone hungry, without worrying about the clouds, for their survival to try to do everything. If someone is sent out with a cattle truck or sent to the countryside to collect manure, someone takes out clothes, pens, watches, gold rings, entrusting for food. A doctor named horse at a provincial epidemic prevention station asked hard friends to help bear the pain and pry the golden teeth, in exchange for a small piece of pancake. I went to the Great Wall and used my precious fox coat for eight pounds of rice to a village cadre. After giving a small spoon to the same room, lock more than seven pounds in the wooden box, take out a little and drink into the broth every day. I'm not too small to lock up a little rice, and it makes sense to be forced to eat food when the man struggles on the line of death. It is a great sorrow to force normal people to steal! When there is nothing to be exchanged, only to the family.\\nA living path. However, some people are in rural areas, and they have difficulties in their own problems. What are the food to help, some people are in urban areas, but they are forced to draw down the lines of ideas and do not dare to take care of it. Some people have been left without access due to divorce. Few can break through the resistance, my mother, in disregard of the residents' committee opposition, accompanied by my young son, hand walking sticks, risking the gobi wind and cold to the farm. When she met in the studio she dusty, hoarse voice, old maiden legs a soft palsy sitting on the ground, my son could not stand up, we three immediately hug their heads and cried. After a good time there was a hard friend persuaded, it should be happy to meet, cry what ah! The mother stopped crying, quietly remove the fried noodles bag from the carrying bag. She said the whole family had saved some tightening belts and bought a few pounds from a cook. I was eager to grab a fried noodle until she finished, and saw the little son twisting his mouth saliva, I could not go up to care, and then grab another, before screaming mother, saying you both ate! She and the child will not eat one after each. The old lady is a little unhappy to say me: just take care of her children. This makes me feel guilty and at the same time feel grievous. Originally, she only thought she could eat a meal on the train, and did not expect the hunger after long distances involved. \\nWhen the old man died many years later, I said to me in front of the hospital bed:... it was not right to care for my children. My sister also said I was wrong, alas! How do they know that I think in a confused mind before the ghost door closes. When my mother and son left the farm with tears, I shake to give the little stone that resembles a puppy from the mine when I shake the back of the ore to his little son, and he lifted his hands to laugh. I sent out the shed two people went far back frequently, I saw the two back until the tears were blurred, closed for a long time, silently blessed them all the way to peace. \\nLater know that the little son put the stone puppy in love, neighbor children compete to play. After knowing the origins of the puppies, the neighborhood committee opened two critical meetings, and asked my parents to share the crime of visiting the farm and not delineating the boundaries of their ideas. The bad words were compounded by the slander, abusive and abusive, and their parents bowed their heads with tears. \\nThe old lady exhausted and fell, attracted a burst of roar. An activist said that the stone puppy was a national relic and that the right child had no right to preserve, she was straightforward from my house. My son cried and my white-haired parents quietly tears. \\nWhen the re-education workers drank the soup, Shandong Dahan and music educator Ren Guangdi, the original bodily burdened and energetic, became thin and weak, described as withered, rickets at the waist, before and after judging two people. He said hello to him once, and he answered, 'OK! Ok! It was a reborn bone!' I can't help but wonder whether this is an ideological transformation or a denial of the right to life. He originally had a tin tin box of cooking debris and insect pupa. When he was found confiscated by the small captain, he died to hold the prayer not loose hand, but eventually because he was too weak, he was taken away by a strong captain, thrown on a foot on the ground. The captain happily went, he cried to pick up a rotten box, and he failed to recover a lot of effort, which broke his life. It is often said that he was hungry, driven by the desire to survive, he sneaked into the cemetery, cut his thighs from the body of the new dead friend from the shallow sand, burn dry blood with wild grass and swallow into small pieces. Not a few days he was swelling, discoloration of his skin, spit down, dying to the hard friend conveiled the truth of eating human flesh. He mumbled and said, 'I'm against my conscience. I'm sorry!' At that time, the tragedy of the same kind of food occurred. At the beginning, others were angry and disgrasped at the beginning, and when they came to Ren Guang to come out of this unseen stupid thing, the guys had seen no wonder. Someone forgave sympathetic forgiveness and said: Alas! How can you blame him? The music educator of the famous Qin deyulong Land said in a faint voice at his dying: 'I'm not willing to die unclear!' He died in the afternoon, and he did not take away the body until the next day by a person who had an extra steamed bread and loaded several bodies into the beach with a shelf car. \\nSaid the Allegro book is very smart, collects a square tin lunch canned meat box. Tie a piece of wire on the waistband and hidden under the placket to prevent theft or forfeiture by the captain. When sleeping in your arms, go to the toilet also do not forget to bring. He captured maggots, grasshoppers... and he cooked broth with wild rai, closed his eyes with tears. There is no power to squat the stools, but standing up the ass on the wall, or black water down the legs. Once I picked up a piece of rotten melon peel, boiled and sterilized and drank, he licked his mouth and said there was a sweet mile. But not too often, it's more than that. He is strong and struggled on the death line, constantly looking for food for hunger. There are a lot of lizard toads on the arable land on the beach, pay army once caught a big toad, while the ripper was cleaning, some people advised: this thing is highly toxic, a primary school teacher in the Qili River eats this poisoning a few days ago died. Fu said: Boil more poison in the water, and the meat is eaten. He finished a few stutters, and his head was swollen and shortness of breath and dizzy. He was knowledgeable and immediately understood that the poisoning was severe. He said with sadness, 'My life is over, alas! Tell the truth guilty, loyalty is teased. Survival, death is sorry. Sad ah! A talented young man was killed by hunger. After his death, two eyes were open, and a hard friend closed his eyes with his hands. Every day dead, everyone consciously fled, to the death nerve of the hard friend to be indifferent. \\nAt the end of 1960, I lay down in a dim, on one side, the dead Telecommunications Bureau colleague Guo Xiying, and the dead Air Force ground crew Liu Mao Guang Technician, accompanied the two dead people for a full week before they were pulled away by the corpses. It's not blame that the carcasses work slacking, but busy. In January 1961 began to save lives, the first returned by Lanzhou financial and trade system was Chen Pide, Liu Tianxi, Baizheng, Yang Fashi and a large number of people. Some units did not come to pick up, and we are one of them. People died every day, the head of the farm panicked his hands and feet, slaughtered sheep every day, and dun had lamb sheep, and took back the lives of a few people from death. There is a cadre named Yuan Tingdong, who is busy to save lives. He always cares for the sick people after eating well after he eats well and shows a benevolent heart. I was unable to move around when I left the farm. It was Mr. Yuan who took me in the cow car to the train station. At that time, there was no normal one of the re-education personnel, and the labour force mobilized many people to support the farm and rushed to take people on a animal power truck or car. When I went to the railway station or died again on the train, I finally boiled to Lanzhou station, where the Provincial Committee's United Front Work Department received a car from the provincial people's hospital for medical treatment. \\nAfter a short period of medical treatment and nutrition, I did not have major health problems, I was discharged from the hospital to report to the City Telecommunication Bureau. Who's the head of the knowledge bureau said himself, did not mention what he said, 'Return to work after six months of labor', but rather asked me to take $24 per month as a handyman. How can such a little treatment feed my parents and children, so I refuse to go to work. Pull a broken shelf car walk the streets and lane to pull goods, eat its hard and sweet. My love unit Hongqi machinery factory director cares for my difficulties, I want me to pull from the factory to the sales department daily delivery, a car shipping cost 4 yuan, really happy lucky. \\nAfter the four-person gang collapsed, (under the guidance of the chief designer Deng Gong liberation ideology and pragmatic route, under the supervision of the Lanzhou Municipal Committee Organization Department leadership, put into effect a policy to overcome the grievances and enjoy the rest of the ordinary employees. The whole family moved from the countryside to their homes, and the children had formal jobs. We have lived a happy and happy life. It is hoped that history will be taken as a guide, and never again unfold the tragedies of anti-right and cultural revolution that are wrong with the country. I hope to implement the three representative ideas, build our great motherland more prosperous and prosperous.), Organizally, I have implemented policies, overcome the grievances and enjoy leave according to ordinary employees. The whole family moved from the countryside to their homes, and the children had formal jobs. \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 9"

				"memoirContent": "[Attached] Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China: Directive to the Provincial Youth Committee's Report on the Anti-Party Words and Deeds and Handling Opinions of Chou zuohua (1958.9.8)\\nLetter dated 3 September. The provincial committee thinks that the main mistake of Qu Zuohua is that serious right-leaning opportunities and extremist individualism have developed to have individual political ambitions, and that during the big show, sympathy and support for the right to attack the party, has played the role of inciting the flames. The circumstances are serious. But considering the mistakes of Qu on the subject of division, the division began to shift to the right, that is, at the general meeting took the initiative to review (although it is not profound, but also an earlier shift). The issue of 'four powers' and 'trification' was attached to the anti-party ideology of Xiangnan and played a role in propagating, but it had not yet caused Serious evil consequences; mistakes in writing editorial issues, which had been read by Comrade Tanshin before publication. In the past, work was generally done; performance is good. Finally, after criticism, we can recognize mistakes and express repentance. On this basis, the Provincial Committee decided: not to refer to the right, give the remaining party inspectors two years, remove all posts, downgrade two levels, and delegate grass-roots exercise. \\n8 September 1958\\nAppendix: Report of the Provincial Youth Committee on Qu Zuohua's Opinions and Deeds and Disposal\\n(1), The anti-party words and deeds of Hudu Zuohua have long been exposed during the whole wind movement After he violated the instructions of the Provincial Committee and supported the unreasonable demands of right-wing elements in handling Guangzhou teacher and college students, a member of the school had written a letter to the Ministry of Culture and Education of the Provincial Committee to reflect. When the double anti-movement, the division also has comrades posted a large print newspaper, publicly exposed. The regiment's central secretariat knew that the revenge had also raised criticism after attacking Comrade Tian Shin when the big print was magnified. In the anti-right leaning conservative, cadres of the Provincial Committee and organs of the regiment also made a lot of opinions on the hatred While we recognize the seriousness of some of the issues of hatred, we criticized it in May this year in the Standing Committee, but because of the ideological right and the lack of principle, criticism was not timely enough and did not mobilize the masses to fully expose. The criticism of some issues has not been raised to the height of principle. We should review this point. \\nRecently, in deepening the wind, the Party Central Committee once again proposed to ensure the absolute leadership of the Party to the corps. The Third Plenum of the Third Plenary Session of the Mission revealed the right-wing Opportunistic mistakes of Xiangnan. These, have given us a lot of inspiration. In the expanded meeting of the Standing Committee held from August 19 to 31 (with the participation of the Secretaries of the Land Commission and comrades in charge of various departments), as we followed the instructions of the provincial committee, carefully studied the documents, let go and launch the masses, the anti-party words and deeds of hatred as China were finally revealed thoroughly and comprehensively. \\n(2), Qu Zuohua's anti-party words and deeds are mainly manifested in the following three aspects:\\nFirst, the absolute leadership of the opposition group attempted to tamper with the communist direction of the youth movement. \\nIn September 1956, Qu Zuohua drafted an editorial for the Southern Daily ('Caring for the Growth of the Young Generation'), in blatant violation of the instructions of the provincial committee and distorted the spirit of the second provincial congress. Mission of the province 'two major' proposed tasks, advocate isolated care and meet The demands of young people in the areas of marriage, cultural and entertainment, sports, etc., attempt to deteriorate the organization of the mission and disengage from the political direction of the party. \\nOn the eve of the convening of the 'Second Congress' of the regiment province, the hatred advocated the resolution of the Youth League's own cadres and funding issues at the conference. Criticized the Standing Committee, regardless of these issues, 'open one eye, close one eye', and 'not hard' against the provincial party committee, actually wanted to 'tough' from the province and tried to compete with the Party. During the Third National Congress, he continued to insist on this opposition proposition and expected major 'reforms' (essentially anti-party reforms), on these issues. In his editorial 'Caring for the Growth of the Young Generation', he attacked the Party 'to intervene and limit the activities of the Youth League too much,' and slander the party 'the system leadership of the mission is in a state of paralysis.' Because he had such anti-party ideas, after knowing the intentions of the Party Central Committee-which could not be sounded at the 'three major' congresses, he still believed that 'put a good thing at the conference'; and to belittle the achievements of the conference with the 'Three Big Three', and oppose Chairman Mao's 'Three Big Three' in a double-factional approach. Estimates of. \\nEnemy strongly endorsed and actively disseminated the anti-party platform of Xiangnan. He thinks that the 'ten-point proposal' of Xiangnan is very good and very enlightening. He has set up an article on 'Intervention in National Life' in the Guangdong Youth Daily. He blame the students' troubles on leadership bureaucracy. On the other hand, he said to Comrade Luo Yi, secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee, 'general, nothing new', but he did not convey it. \\nQu played an anti-party role in the troubles of teachers and college students. He has listened to the instructions of Comrade Rao Juangxiang to convey Comrade Tao Zhu, and in blatant contravention of the provincial committee's instructions, promised students to repair the swimming pool and support the unjustified demands of right-wing elements to reform the school system. He called on the team members to support the 'student' request. Attempts to guide the team members to walk with the right-wing elements. On the other hand, he reversed black and white, criticized the teachers 'committee and the school leadership bureaucracy, and openly cracked down on the secretaries of the Faculty Commission who insisted on the correct position. He also participated in the illegal 'Shining Committee' organized by right-wing elements, and exchanged phone numbers with its master (right). His behavior with the party to play has had a very bad effect. Rightists believe that 'the Provincial Party Committee of the Regiment supports' them, that the school party, political and political party committees are under attack, and even several regiment branches have posted large print papers demanding 'restructuring' of the regiment committee. \\nSecond, actively support attacks against the party together with the right-wing elements and the right-wing elements. \\nDuring the great magnification period, among the cadres of organs and colleges, in the name of 'introducing' the emblem of Peking University and Tsinghua, he beautified the right-wing activist Lin Xiqu, demonizing the activists of Peking University, treating rightists as an expression of 'active thinking', 'dare to say and dare to do' to Ignition. \\nQu Zuohua praised the large print of the South China School of Teachers and the right-wing attacks on party committee secretaries by the Chinese University. The sea breeze attacked a reactionary 'poem' by Comrade Chen Weishi. He thinks that it was written very well, and he took a part of the big print that attacked the Party, and encouraged the cadres of the organs and said, 'These big print newspapers are very good, you should go to visit.' He attacked Comrade Longqin at the Congress of the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Committee and organs of the Regiment Provincial Committee, saying, 'The Dragon Dive is bad,' in order to incite the right party to attack. Also to the provincial party committee cadres attending the third enlargement meeting of the provincial committee, said: 'Longqian is the modern Chen Shimei'. and instructed the right-wing elements of the China Youth Daily to visit CUHK and write sketches to attack the Party. \\nIn the revelation, the hatred wrote two large print newspapers, the core of the leadership of the provincial committee of the attack group (not finished), defaming Comrade Tian Xin is a 'microphone tube' and 'the first bureaucratic of the sky word'. At the same time, he actively launched other comrades and asked others to cooperate with him to continue his large print; and said to a comrade: 'Write the big print, I supply materials.' Revenge also attacked comrades who did not emerge 'the world', 'speak strategy'. For right-wing elements (such as Li Kangmin, Zhuang Yang, etc.), the enuge is actively sheltered. \\nQu Zuohua also has doubts about counteracting. He doubted whether the Provincial Committee and organs of the regiment had struggled more people, and questioned the need for the struggle against Chen Bingshao, Xu Geyang, Yu Zhongda and others. \\nThird, poor quality, with personal political ambitions, attempted to seize the leadership of the provincial committee of the regiment. \\nThe individualist ideology of hatred is extremely serious. He asks for money from the party's top officials. He was also deputy secretary of the Provincial Committee of the regiment and wanted to climb up; he was very dissatisfied that he had not been appointed as a member of the In the wage reform, there is a requirement to mention two levels of dissatisfaction with only one level. Because the welfare will adhere to the principle and did not grant him subsidies, he was competing to attack the welfare association as a 'charity authority' and raised the threat of 'return to Dalian'. He was dissatisfied with the cadre decentralization, saying, 'When a farmer for a lifetime, I didn't know, I was here to revolutionize. \\nThe hatred is extremely arrogant, empty, refuses to criticize. Poor quality: bullying on the down, face a set, behind a set, blow others, raise themselves, popularize, self-bragging. \\nFeud has a personal political ambition. He arduously believed that 'the secretaries of the provincial committee of the other regiment are not as good as me', 'Tian heart is not stronger than me,' and that 'Tian Shin does not qualify as party secretary of He seized some of the shortcomings of Comrade Tian Xin in an attempt to attack Comrade Tian Xin, to support the right-wing elements of the China Youth Daily, and copied the sketch text of the attack on Comrade Tian Xin to the 'Pepper' supplement (not published). And with ambition, he said to others: 'Tianxin is best transferred to provincial people to commission government work,' in an attempt to drive away Comrade Tanshin. At this point, his ambitions are completely exposed. \\nIn the face of a large number of facts, Qu Zuohua bowed his guilt, but the review was not profound. \\n(3), Comrades who participated in the expanded meeting of the Standing Committee expressed a lot of indignation at the anti-party words and deeds of Qu Zuohua. It was believed that the feud was an anti-party and personal ambition; his problem was a contradiction. In dealing with, the vast majority of comrades (more than 20), suggested that he should wear the hat of the right-wing, expelling his party membership and removing all positions; a minority (4), comrades suggested that it is not excessive to classify the hatred as right-wing, but when dealing with it, you can consider not wearing the right hat, as an internal issue. Ruling, that is, retain party membership and remove all posts. \\nAfter our discussion, the opinions on the treatment of Qu Zuohua were: to dismiss party membership and remove all posts. Whether it is classified as the right, please decide by the provincial committee. The handling method is only communicated to the cadres of the County Committee or above, not publicly reported. \\nPlease indicate whether the above comments are appropriate. \\n3 September 1958\\n[Compilation of Decisions on Purging Rightists in the Party', prepared by the General Office of the Supervision Commission of the CPC Central Committee, December 1959]\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"

The situation, what I did in the whole wind was entirely good intentions, to 'help the party to rectify the wind' When asked who said this, he said he was saying, 'If they do not participate in the movement, they would suspect that you don't love the party, not socialism'. When asked who said this, he said he was a comrade. People, provoke the purpose of group relations. \\nWhen he learned to review, he lifted his head all day long and hid in the dormitory and wrote 'Review', and the result was nothing in the Review. He described himself as a pioneer in helping the party to rectify the winds, was the ability to launch the masses and organize the masses. Four reviews never touched on their true ideological essence. Finally, he also spoke with other right-wing parties.

Since then, I have lost my lovely mother forever, and I have no more mom in this life. It is not enough to express the degree of my grief, I just want to write down something, and my sorrow and remorse, for my mother, for myself, and for all the children of the world who are worthy of my mother. \\nMother Qin qiwen, born on June 18, 1919 (lunar May 21), was born in Shanghai Yinxing town of a small family. According to her mother: her too high ancestor was once a liberal arts officer in the Qianlong era. He was an official in Beijing, when the kingdom of Taiping was relocated from Jiading to Yin, because her mother was the only sole daughter, so she was loved by Grandma Grandma, using the palm pearl to describe a little too much. She completed primary school in town, that is, admitted to Shanghai woo female secondary school, junior high school, but also outside public as a model, admitted to Jiangsu Taicang teacher (the foreign official was the principal of primary school, is also a teacher graduate). From birth to teacher reading this time, perhaps the most enjoyable and beautiful time of mother's life, basically can be said to be carefree. \\nOn August 13, 1937, after the wicked Japanese devils entered Shanghai and put the ancient town of Yin Yin as a military airport, the misery of her mother began. Although she later completed her work at Daxia University's Department of Political Economics (the predecessor of China Normal University), she became a teacher; although she married a national army officer and gave birth to two sons, rewriting the history of the seven generations of the Qin family leaflets. The fate of misery is almost always accompanied by a mother, as if a man walked there and the shadow goes there. Three years after marriage were busy getting pregnant and giving birth and feeding their children, it could be said that there was no benefit. New China was founded in 1949. When dad went to Taiwan, her mother was only 30 years old. Young widowhood is not easy, but has to be both father and mother. At that time I would just walk, my brother was still eating milk, and there was a wife and grandmother on it to feed her. Such a heavy burden has been hard enough for a single woman, with her preference as if she was not suffering enough. In 1958, she repaid her a right-wing hat and was punished by a lowering salary reduction. The teachers from the city's key high schools were downgraded to the staff of non-key secondary schools in the district, and also assigned to Chongming Wai Reclamation Farm for one year. There is actually one of the counts that was made to the right. From 1949 to 1958, there was no change to marry for an entire decade, indicating that there was a fantasy about the anti-revolutionary husband, really wanted to inflict a sin, why did it suffer! \\nMy mother had quietly said to me: because her grandfather died in the Japanese devils in the war of invasion of China, she as a female runner could not personally avenge the official, so married a soldier who killed the Japanese devils for her, is also considered to comfort the grandfather's spirit in heaven. \\nSince 1958, mothers had not only had to suffer from inherent hardships, but also from spiritual to physical suffering from the right. In 1966, when the Cultural Revolution began, mother's bitter days were compounded by the fire, and all sorts of inhumane encounters, beaten and cursed became a routine routine. When I tipped up her relics, I found a letter from her to the school leader, complaining about the Cultural Revolution when two girls beat her the most powerful and cruel. One is Liu Zhilan, who played the most at the sixty-eighth session of junior high school, hit the most, almost every day, and the other is Yu Huifen of junior high school's sixty-seventh session, hit the most fierce. She actually beat her mother's ears deaf and cut her teeth off. These two young girls must also be mothers now. Looking back on past events, I wonder if they have confession for this ugly history of that year? Is there a reflection? O Sin! \\nTen years of havoc. Fortunately, history was written by the people, and the gang of four people who were angry was finally sent to the courtroom of history, nailed to the shame frame of history. Mom was also 'liberated' in 1979 after the Third Plenum. Unfortunately, at this time she has retired, and she can no longer return to the podium of thinking about her algebraic geometry. With the deepening of reform and opening-up in the mainland, Dad returned to Shanghai for the first time from Taipei in the summer of 1988, which naturally gave her mother great joy and great comfort. But Dad became a new home in Taipei, and it was a deep regret for her mother, but with the great mind of an Eastern woman, her mother accepted this sad reality. \\nBecause of so many blows and tortures, her heart has been very bad, but she tenacious survives year after year. Her old age deals with doctors almost every day, and taking pills seems to be an important part of her life. Rugged experiences, unfortunate encounters, ruthless blows make her much older than her peers. \\nLast summer, when Dad returned to Shanghai again to visit his family, her mother was already old and sick. Dad did not go long, her mental and physical strength was clearly not, sleep often nightmares, not Toyo soldiers came, or red guards hit her, heard her dreams and exclamations, I often rose up in the middle of the night to remind her, and then to comfort her for a long time, in order to make her fall asleep again. I see a lot of the repentance of the Japanese devils from the newspapers. I don't seem to see much of the penitentiary of the Red Guards. Maybe the red guards were small when they did evil, and when they grew up, they never thought they had done it right at that time. This reminds me of Barao's proposal to set up a museum of the Cultural Revolution. It seems necessary to forget, it means betrayal! \\nThis period of time, whenever I sit down, I inadvertently think about my mother, even though she has been gone for more than seven weeks and, according to our local customs, has broken seven. But I still have difficulty in grief and guilt, and the great sense of loss can not be balanced. Mom is a part of my life, and this blood connection is impossible and impossible to break. See the image of my mother smiling at me, but I can't help but want to cry, come back every day, home still, but I can't hear my mother kindly called 'Xiao Jing, is Nong back', the dinner table has no mother's chopsticks, watching TV no mother sitting on the couch Shadow and her merciful face. \\nI saw that she taught me to be an upright person from the beginning of my understanding, and when my brother and my brother had not been in primary school, she told us historical stories such as mother-in-law stabbing, Qu Yuan Qijiang and other historical stories, and stealthily cultivated our patriotism spirit. I saw the tonsils knives in my elementary school, and she cried with me, and I didn't understand it, but I didn't think it was a small operation, it didn't matter, there was something to cry. In fact, how can I understand how a mother who has lost her husband takes her son, especially the eldest son, as the root of life, poor parents! I saw me overcome the resistance (father counter-revolutionary, mother's right), when I took high scores for the key middle school, how my mom was more happy than me, she burned a delicious meal of comfort to me, and asked me what gifts I needed! I saw my mother endured all sorts of inhuman abuse in the Cultural Revolution and 'steal life', all for me and my brother. Otherwise, with the capricious and temper of her sole daughter adopted from the petite, and how many intellectuals have a little 'taxis can kill and not humiliate' human dignity, she will definitely choose a hundred of this path. In short, at that time, to live, in fact, it will be more painful than death ah. I saw during the Cultural Revolution, I tried to accompany my mother to see a Korean movie 'Flower Girl', a crying in the movie theater, I wonder if my mother was not crying very badly, I quietly asked why, my mother said almost like a complaint: 'Flower girl is not bitter than me.' I was really shocked. \\nI see that whenever I have any article published in a newspaper magazine or radio, Mom has been sharing the joy of success with me and always being my first reader, often crying sad and crying for the article. I saw that when I joined a democratic party and became a member of the CPPCC, she was all sincerely happy. On one occasion, I was elected as a member of the DRC, who also participated in the congress as a contact person. On the way home, she actually said to me the word 'mother and son expensive' that feudal color is very strong. I know that this is mom happy for me and proud of me. She has been living in humiliation and has not been so happy for a long time. I saw that whenever I had a cold, cough or something, she was always worried that she couldn't sleep, urged me to go to the hospital and warned me to take an X-ray. But I actually get impatient and sometimes scare her, 'Mom, I'm afraid I'm going to have cancer!' In a hurry, she said, 'Little devil, have to be blind and four words, do not speak mess when touching the moldy head.' Alas, can I understand the love of my Mother? \\nI also saw many days with my mother, and I felt there were many places I could do better, but I didn't do it, for example, she always wanted to watch the Taiwan movie 'Mom Loves Me Again', but I've been dragging, I didn't see it. She always wanted me to travel with her to Beijing once, and for a variety of reasons, did not materialize. By contrast, my love for me is selfless and infinite, my love for mom is selfish and limited. Why can't I cherish my life with us every year, month, every week, every day of my life? Can you use the unit to work busy, home to accompany his son to learn busy to congestion? Ask yourself, my love and patience compared with my mother to us, is simply a difference! Now I think about how to be good for my mother, and then how to try how to do filial, mother she will not know, bite her teeth or cut her teeth or breasts, all sorts of regret and pain will accompany me for the rest of my life, there is no pill of regret! \\nThe Buddha said: 'Life is the edge of all things,' this thousands of worlds, the vast world, I became my mother's son, and I have been a mother and son for 47 years, and my mother and my mother are not shallow. I don't know if there is a afterlife, there is no reincarnation, if so, I hope to still be your son, by that time, I will not let my mom be angry again and let my mother down again. Mom, would you like to wait for me on Huangquan Road?! \\nNote 1: This photograph is a selected image of the mother, taken in 1953 when she was selected from a primary school teacher as a secondary school teacher. \\nNote 2: When the war of resistance broke out in 1937, his father Huang Guozhen, Yi Rong from the university, with Sun Liren troops to participate in the 8.1 and three Songhu war, and then joined the army in the Zhejiang war zone, as a Lieutenant Colonel instructor to participate in many big and small battles against the Japanese devils, nine dead for a lifetime, after the victory of the army in Shanghai \\nNote 3: The correction of the mother Qin Yewen. \\nReplies to Comrade Qin Yewen's Right\\nEducation Commission (79), No. 44\\nCCP East Middle School Branch (Total Branch):\\nYour organization submitted a report on 7 March 1979 on the rectification of the right issue of Comrade Qin qiwen and, after study, agreed to correct it, withdraw its original disposition, restore political honor and resume its original salary grade as of October 1978, in accordance with the relevant provisions of document No. 55 of the CPC Central Committee \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\). \\nCefu\\nThis copy is consistent with the original of Comrade Qin's personnel file. \\n2009.4.16\\n(Chapter 'Office of the Beijing Education Committee of the Communist Party of China (Shanghai)')\\nShanghai Yubei District Education Bureau Committee\\n(Chapter 'Communist of China, Shanghai Beibei District Education Bureau Committee')\\n8 March 1979"

				"memoirContent": "【Attached】Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China: Political Conclusions on the Right Party, Qin ruzhe (1958.4.28)\\nQin ruzhe, male, Han, now 33 years old, Shanxi people, family origin landlord and business, I constituent students, in 1938 to participate in the revolution, 1940, is currently the director of Lanzhou City Public Security Bureau, municipal committee members. \\nThe main problem in history: in 1947, when Jinsui, he had been detained by the masses for three days (because his brother Qin Ruying fled, and he was going to be fought). \\nQin ruzhe's main right words and deeds:\\n1. Agree to right-wing speech\\n1. Agree with the proposal of the right-wing, Shuizi, to promulgate the Criminal Code, establish a law school, and establish an examination system. He said, 'Shuizi proposed to set up a law school. I think it is very necessary. At present, our judicial cadres urgently need formal legal training. As for the cadres proposed by Shuizi to implement the examination system, it may be considered to implement it at this time.' and agreed with the fallacy of right-wing Qu Linghan attacking the socialist wage system. \\n2. When visiting abroad in 1956, studying eight documents in Changchun and discussing the policy of 'long-term coexistence and mutual supervision', Minister Qin was dissatisfied with the accusations of Huang Shaohong. He said: 'In Huang Shaohong's speech there is no attack, Minister Luo is not calm.' \\nSecond, provoke party group relations, incite opposition objects to turn the case\\nAt the first symposium of the Municipal Public Security Bureau on 22 May 1957, it was said: 'Some issues are not appropriate to deal with them now... I consider it inappropriate and speak out irrelevant, for example, we have to review them now, but because of the constraints of different circumstances, some problems cannot be felt. For example, the sentiments of Li Zhenji (right-wing elements), have come in the past, but as we talk about today, we don't feel the smell of pressure on our heads. But bureaucracy, subjectivity, sectarianism, and sectarianism they suffer much, there is an eagerly need to reverse hope.' \\n2. At the second symposium on 28 May 1957, said: 'There are some issues that you can also study, such as sectarianism, bureaucratic issues, etc. Now, the relationship between parties and non-parties should be changed, it is time... Some deal with problems can be studied overturned, hoping to help investigate this issue' \\nIII. Attack against the anti-movement\\n1. At the end of the anti-counter movement in the early days, he believes that 'counterproductive achievements are not too big, but many shortcomings. I feel that the face of the struggle is wider, there are few real anti-revolutionaries fighting out. Some of the problems that can be solved by the trial and trial are also a priority fight against them.' \\nIn October 1956, at a cadre meeting of all unit chiefs or above, as a report entitled 'There are anti-necessity, wrong must be corrected', in fact, one-sided emphasis was placed on the 'wrong must be done' and the 'anti-necessity' approach was lost. \\n3. On May 22 and 28, 1957, in the municipal public security bureau held two symposiums, some of the opposing objects asked to see their own rebellion files, he replied: 'You can see' and said: 'Some of the things that have been dealt with, if there are problems can be studied and overturned, hoping to help check this problem'. \\nIV. Cadre policy and organizational principles of opposition parties\\n1. Some non-party cadres (some later right-wing elements), put forward that the public security organs send cadres to work outside the country. The introduction letter indicates the political situation (party members). They asked for cancellation of contacts, and he said 'can consider'. Because of his support, some non-party cadres once went out to work to write a letter of introduction, they refused to use a letter with political information. \\n2. After the wind began, at a seminar between non-party personnel and some people with opinions, non-party cadre Luo Fengming proposed, 'Why do you want party members to be transferred to study?' He said, 'There is no provision for this, and it is executed like that.' \\n3. Some non-party cadres (some are now right-wing elements), raised in the public security bureau section and branch chief cadres who all want party members? 'I see some people can be promoted,' he said. \\n4. He also said: 'In the past we have been too tight to people who have problems in history, for example, some people are the backbone of pseudo-party groups, but given the enemy for a short period of time, we have worked for many years after liberation, tightened on these people, in fact, the educational role of the party is insufficient estimates.' \\nV. Leader of the opposition party, refuses to implement the policies and instructions of their superiors\\n1. In 1956, the central government proposed the fight against destruction accidents, Lanzhou City arranged for a period of time. By March 1957, when summing up the work of insurance, he thinks Lanzhou there were few damage accidents, raised anti-vandalism accidents, a little out of the actual, and thought that on-site security work and security inspection work were basically a On the matter, advocate transfer to the security inspection department to go to the pipe. And the primary task of combating sabotage accidents in the central economic insurance work was changed to 'safe production and prevent accidents'. At the same time in March 1957 at the meeting of the Second Section, Team Leader, said: 'Reactionary slogans, leaflets rumors cannot be considered as accidents, and write a report to the Central Committee (the actual Central Committee has already made a decision, reactionary slogans, etc., should be treated as an accident), and noisy events should not be viewed as hostile, if the reactionary slogans are treated as an accident. See, the slogan against vandalism is also right to mention another 100 years.' \\n2. The provincial public security department proposed a severe crackdown on the United States and Jiang's special agents. He thinks that 'the riots in Gansu are prominent, cannot be compared to the coastal areas. We have not had much to do here by the United States and Jiang's agents here. This slogan is not specific. Gansu should start with detailed investigation and research work', 'The reactionary slogans are mostly children. Written, Residual Counterrevolutionary Basic Clear' and other invincible or less enemy arguments in his outing 'Other places are not necessarily familiar with the hostility,' said to the Chief of Section after the visit. He also said: 'Before visiting, the work of Lanzhou, this time to look at other places, it will be assured.' And think that 'Lanzhou economic security positions are getting bigger and bigger, security positions are getting smaller and smaller.' As a result, in April last year, at his active initiative, the Municipal Council, Warp and Man III Scouting Section was merged into one Scouting Section and a Protection Section. \\nIn 1954, he advocated the downsizing of the police stations, the strengthening of police stations, abolishing the station and turning the station into a supervisory character. In fact, police stations were not strengthened, but rather weakened the forces of the struggle against the enemy in terms of organizational structures, which greatly affected the work. \\n3. In 1957, the Provincial Public Security Department instructed Lanzhou City to carry out a campaign against criminals, and began his question of whether or not to engage in a campaign, shaken, or not to call the campaign, in fact, did not agree with the campaign. In the future, although agreed to do so, personal research and supervision was not enough, so that the campaign was slow and combat was slow, and criminal cases continued to rise after the campaign ended. \\n4. Some of the methods of reconnaissance that the central authorities require the personal approval of the Director are also handed over to the main and deputy heads of section for approval. \\n5. The Central Ministry of Public Security stipulates that the business of the six sections of the City Bureau shall regularly write thematic reports to the relevant business units of the Central Public Security Ministry, while he proposes that the branch and branch offices write a summary report once a year. \\nIt has been more than half a year since he suspended his duties in October last year, Qin has no knowledge of the aforementioned anti-party words and deeds. Especially during the party congress, after large and small will expose criticism, Qin not only did not bow his head to plead guilty, but instead used four people, including the Party Xingmin, to publicly defend him, relieve his guilt and try to confuse the boundaries of the enemy. muddle. \\nBased on the above facts, Qin ruzhe was classified as a right-wing element, expelled from the Party of China, abolished all posts and assigned jobs with lower treatment, as discussed at the second congress of Lanzhou City of China on April 26, 1958.

Here, the smell of new China and free China cannot smell, and the relationship between people is alert, pouring and framing. It is full of vulgar and selfishness, full of rot. \\nWhat warm family, what collective, what kind of mutual assistance and friendship, these words, if attached to our class, are an insult to these beautiful terms; the so-called leaders, you are not leading, you are ruling! \\nTruly righteous, pure, non-victimized youth in our class are the targets of your oppression. Because Liu (Dingcheng), does not object to you, you want to pull him over as a shun man and isolate me. \\nThe trio question is that you are wrong, but add 'backward', 'resistance' hat to the people who give opinions. Of course, you are in power, we have no way. But you are wrong yet to admit that many young people are unable to lift their heads under your oppression. \\nWhen receiving party and group members, consideration of conditions is completely contrary to the spirit of the party and group chapter. Enrolment is not subject to a real test, but a process of learning hypocrisy, learning the process of being Shunmin...

In 1934, he went to the United States to learn home economics for several months, after returning home through Gong Zizhi relations, as a female teacher and director of Kunhua. In 1940, he was promoted to principal. In 1947, he was a life welfare officer of the pseudo-provincial women's association, lecturer of the education department of Kunming Normal University and director of the Women's Branch of Model Relief Institute. After liberation, the secondary school is the principal. He joined the NLD in 1956 and elected a member of the Provincial Committee of the NLD, and transferred to the NPC in 1957 as convener of the Preparatory Working Group for the People's Republic of Kunming. Before liberation, Qin and Gong Zizhi, Liu Youtang, Zhang Zhizhai, Sun Dongming and other bureaucratic financial valves were very closely exchanged. Qin went abroad to study abroad, funded by Liu, Zhang, Sun and other people, returned to the country for Gong Zi's reuse. In 1940 reactionary Sanqing League division secretary Liu Zhihuan and Shao Zibo went to Kunhua women's middle school activities, Qin said, introduced by Liu Zhihuan to join the three youth group, as secretary of the school, forced to cheat a large number of students into the regiment, and instigated students to 'donate' glider funds. In the student movement, parents were forced to stop students from strikes, torn down student newspapers, send workers to monitor student meetings and forced a group of students to send a group of students to a summer camp for reactionary training in order to disrupt the student movement. Therefore, be tasted by the reactionaries. Sam Youth League instructor in 1946. In 1947, colluded with Xiong Yingjun, principal of women's vocational schools, supported the Xiong's campaign for the Pseudo-National University deputies, and Xiong supported Qin's campaign for fake provincial councillors and actively conducted activities After liberation, the Party and the People's Government continued to carry out the work of unity education and reform of Qin, and gave high treatment to political life. She was elected as a member of the provincial government, the provincial people's representative, the executive committee of the provincial women's federation, and the provincial CPPCC member, but Qin did not change herself very well, on the contrary, did not perform very well in his work.. Three anti-China corruption Kunfemale furniture and other things, is not very good, and the inspect is not profound in the transformation of ideas. In the past few years, the Vice-Chancellor of Qin Ren College has been less responsible for his work. It is often 'three days of fishing and two sunbathing nets'. On some issues, they often insist on subjective views, or after consulting privately with his crest, Wang Quan and others, decide not to listen to the greetings of the party organization, but rather shouted that the Party did not respect her, and described the Party's supervision of school administration as a result of her 'wearing sandals', and excluding party members deputy principals and teachers and provoking party group relations. Desiring to get rid of party leadership. \\nI. Opinion of anti-socialism\\n(1), Proponent professors\\nShe took Chairman Mao's speech conveyed by Zhang Bojun's distorted message in the so-called 'Chairman Mao agreed to abolish the school's party committee system,' she put a red line to everyone to see, and told the attached teacher that 'professors should consider governing schools'. \\n(ii), Rejecting the achievements of social reform movements\\nTo the anti-counter movement, she said: 'Estimate the enemy too big, but also put the problem of thinking into counteraction. After the campaign, more negative, shrunk, dare not to go, dare not to say, go to the hall also dare not dare, fight against the current activities, so they go to the lecture hall, and some come back to feel despised'. 'After thinking, some felt that there was no prestige, it was difficult to teach students, and some said 1952 was an unforgettable year'. To teaching reform, she said: 'Many jobs are forms, university secondary school teaching reform is so, it is not appropriate to use the five principles of secondary schools to set up universities.' 'Learning (refers to political learning), is also a form, with little effect, some teachers sit for three hours and get nothing,' she added. 'In the end, the psychological characteristics of the intellectuals are untouched, the party leadership intellectuals business should be considered more.' 'Politics and business in the past were disconnected, politics was empty shelves and nothing attached.' In short, 'the better things go down, the worse the bad things go down, the worse things go down.' \\n(iii), Distorting the role of democratic parties\\nExaggerate non-party personalities 'have no power' issue and slander the party's policy of united war. 'Researching major issues in schools is only discussed jointly by the consortium trade union administration, without the participation of the Democratic Party, which looks like 'eyebrows on the face of the school' and does not work,' she said. But a little question is how your democratic party is.' 'In the school leadership work, I have a little sense of wearing sandwich shoes, the leadership has little trust, and there is no right for the United Front target.' \\n(iv), Vicious attacks on party organizations in schools\\nShe said: 'After the Party's policy passed certain party members, it was a little wrong. The concrete manifestation was not believing in the masses, things were blocked, and there was little democratic style, and criticism could not be carried out.' 'Some school party members are ununited, I see your shortcomings, you see my shortcomings, each other must show themselves, compete for profit, do not explore the business, form weak leadership, can not play a role model in the masses.' 'School members are unwilling or not willing to reach out to the masses and listen to the opinions of all aspects. Some party members refuse to reach out to the masses, listen widely to the opinions of the masses, listen only to a few activists, while there is a lack of education for activists to connect with the masses. And distorted the real situation, which caused the party to form a bias and get out of the masses.' 'They treat the opinions and demands of the masses and wrongly adopt a separate approach. They are confined only to positive and progressive opinions and requests, in general and backward in particular, to disregard or simple criticism, and order tone, to the right meaning See does not support, does not help it to achieve, impatience to explain and persuade, just hasty and make the masses disobedient.' 'Party members are not humble and patient enough to look down on the opinions of the masses, even like others flattering, unwilling to listen to negative opinions, and their attitude towards teachers is hard, even rough, and hurt the teachers' self-esteem, so their motivation to make opinions is not high.' 'And I look down on the teacher, saying 'Old teachers are backward, history is complicated, and their affair is an old set', so this part of the teachers 'do not work power', feel that they can't 'do their best. '' 'There are also many school party organizations that are not concerned politically about the masses. Many teachers have written applications to join the party. After a second inspection, they also have to do the third inspection. The problem of inspection is mentalism, not specific help. Eli persuaded that only a hat, some ask for some help. The answer was that 'work is busy not having time to talk 'so the teacher feels' asking for progress does not help, asking for party not 'Door road', some say, 'We have not approved a teacher in our school for seven years since liberation. Is it impossible for the party to train a teaching staff who can be qualified to join the party? '' 'Some have not approached the masses after joining the party, especially young party members. They are said to be afraid of the organization's criticism that 'proximity to the backward masses will be impacted. 'This makes the masses not dare to approach them. Some schools because of the principle of party members, some teachers say, 'It is not natural to speak with party members. Teachers are very natural to talk, see the party members come and go one side'. 'Some of the grass-roots party organizations and teachers have only general working relations, lack of comrades feelings and friendships. Some party members are bored with the very few teachers who have lower ideological consciousness. They do not care about them, let's not talk about patience to help. Some party members are proud of complacency, to transform the people themselves, to the group Everyone is a taste of the lesson, so I feel there is nothing to say, the party members are not their own intellectual self.' \\n(5), Provoking primary and secondary school teachers to dissatisfaction with the party and the government\\n'Teachers in primary and secondary schools are overburdened and their work studies are overwhelmed,' she said. 'The teacher did not have Sundays and did not see a movie once in two months.' 'Most teachers feel dizzy, indigestion, stress, no rest, weight loss.' To slander 'teachers are not respected', 'when teachers can't rent a house, can't buy good things, can't find loved ones.' \\nSecond, the activity and performance in the light-ignition everywhere, active attack\\nSince the provincial propaganda meeting, Qin shuzhen's activities have gradually been pushing people everywhere, collecting party shortcomings and preparing to attack the party. First, Qin seizes the Democratic Progressive Organization, and pulls people who are dissatisfied with the Party into the Democratic People's Republic of China in the form of For example, at the time of the Attachment Development Organization, the Party branch had suggested that the NLD and the Democratic People's Advocate should develop, but Qin pulled most of the leaders of the education and research team into the Democratic People's Republic of China in an attempt to expand his political capital, while closely interacting with Wang Quan and Zhu Qiuqing (both right), often to Wang and Zhu Eri People at home or please eat, they conspire, and instruct Zhu Qiuqing back to the fire. After he released the first gun at the provincial CPPCC, Qin grabbed the NLD and the Democratic Progressive Organization in schools, and planned to 'put' who first and then 'put' who. When the Department of Education went to the school for advice, some raised, 'Deputy Director Liu should not put the opinion if he didn't come down.' Qin expressed support. In the Democratic People's Council, Qin instigated, said, 'How to liberate in the future, how to pack it up, you can ask questions and talk from our perspective.' At the forum of the provincial committee United Front Department, Qin further fomerated: 'At present, primary and secondary school teachers reflect whether the whole wind is only senior intellectuals, regardless of our primary and secondary schools.' And with slander and incitement, said: 'Teachers in primary and secondary schools have concerns about the release of 'zero deposit payment', 'lure enemies deep' finally come to a big siege.' At the same time, Qin also gathered exaggerated material about the party's dissatisfaction at the party at the seminar convened by the Democratic People's Progression, and asked for resolution, repeatedly explained, and was still not satisfied. \\nAttack failed, trying to escape the struggle\\nAfter the fight against the right began, Qin used various means to try to escape the struggle. Don't attend meetings everywhere to ask the map. He seized the NLD and the Democratic Progressive Organization (NLD), in school as a cover for her reactionary remarks and deeds, and released her accomplice right, Wang Quan (CDC), in order to cover up their conspiracy activities, disregard the criticism of the masses, resist the censorship and attempt to blame.

The principal went to Kunming to invite the anti-Japanese film propaganda team down to put the film, screened 'Japanese spy', 'anti-Japanese hero Ma Zhanshan' and so on, received a certain effect. On Sunday, the anti-Japanese propaganda team, organized by teachers and students, went to the nearby countryside to publicize and perform. During this period, school funding is very difficult. Principals are going to Kunming every month for funding and stay in Kunming for several days. Summer, after afternoon class, many teachers and students go to the beach to swim in Dianchi; after dinner, sunset, mirrors Dianchi, some paintings, some singing, not fun. Anyone who taught or studied in Kun women during this time, have good memories. Gong Zizi, director of the Department of Education, has visited here twice to praise the situation and environment of the school. \\nKunhua female school in Haiyan town for three years has brought great changes to local rural areas. The school moved down and opened the primary school at the village Guansheng Palace, and peasant children began to have the opportunity to read and literate. Students also organize peasant literacy classes and evening schools for the people to bring cultural knowledge to farmers. The propaganda performances and screenings of films by students have helped farmers to increase their knowledge and understand the principles of anti-Japanese resistance, and many farmers started watching drama and movies only then. \\nIn 1940, Chin Suk Ching Acting Principal, was appointed Principal of Kunhua Women's Secondary School in 1941. Under difficult conditions, she insisted on running a good school, hired a group of outstanding teachers to teach. She actively promoted anti-Japanese salvation, supported anti-Japanese activities led by the underground party and served as the director of the 'Kunhua Women's Social Education Committee', led by the underground party. ethnic and social contributions. \\nIn 1942, Kunhua women moved back to Kunming and the school buildings were damaged. The High School (now 28 lieutenant colleges site), was also occupied by the Seizure Department of the KMT Security Command. The school was unable to attend classes. She repeatedly intervened and asked to return to the school premises was invalid. On one day, Yang Jiafeng went directly to the office of the High School Department for the Superintendent, but the other side avoided seeing it. Yang was outraged and accused the Kuomintang of not justifying it; a few days later, the smuggling office moved away. The school began to attend classes, but the school buildings were broken and there was no money for repair, and by Qin shuzhen launched the whole school teachers and students to raise funds to the community, repair school buildings and build auditoriums. I also got a donation book to find my relatives to donate money. In this way, it has caused public opinion and caused dissatisfaction with the KMT authorities. The authorities, citing Qin shuzhen's 'poor discipline of students,' undermining the prestige of the government, came out by the provincial Senate to face Qin Hengjia's accusations and were preparing to replace her. However, Qin did not fear, and in the form of 'Notice' and 'Statement', he paid back to the accusations in the press. Together with the support of society and the whole school teachers and students, the KMT authorities failed to succeed in the removal of principals, donations in full, victory in the struggle and repair of school buildings. The auditorium was also designed by Engineer Ding Minan and was built in 1944. Coinciding with Mr. Tian Han's anti-Japanese AFS propaganda team arrived in Kun. Qin invited the team to perform in the new auditorium of the school. The repertoire was a large opera 'Jianghan Fishing Song' prepared by Mr. Tian Han, the plot is very touching. Each performance, the auditorium was crowded out of water. Later, the auditorium was a good place for teachers and students to meet and perform, played a great role. \\nIt is also worth mentioning that the 'water real' women's basketball team organized by female secondary school students in Kunming has achieved good results in the various competitions in Kunming, and cultivated some good athletes. Kunhua women also cultivate some outstanding actors for drama and Peking opera. These are all concrete expressions of Qin shuzhen's emphasis on cultural and sports activities. \\nAfter the victory of the resistance in 1945, the Kuomintang launched a civil war. The popular campaign 'Anti-civil war, want peace' was also launched in Kunwomen. Qin shuzhen sympathized with and supported these progressive activities. Soon, Wang Zheng, director of Education Department of Yunnan Province, the Kuomintang forced her to resign on the grounds of 'lack of control over students', and Qin shuzhen also left the Kunwomen. \\nIn October 1948, Qin shuzhen was hired to teach in the education department of Kunming Normal University. In December of the same year, Mr. Liu Youtang set up a model relief home in Yunnan Province to accommodate beggars, prostitutes and street children for self-help; divided into men and women, branches, Liu Ren men's branch director, invited Qin to serve as director of women's branch. A purely obligatory nature. No pay. She proudly promised to devote all her spare time to the work of the home. \\nAfter the peaceful liberation of Yunnan, Qin shuzhen joined the New Democratic Alliance in January 1950; in October, the Central People's Government appointed a member of the Yunnan Provincial People's Government. She actively participates in democratic political activities, with her own influence, unites teachers and educators in schools, and works hard for socialist education. Has been elected as the provincial people's Congress deputies, the Standing Committee of the CPPCC, the Provincial Women's Federation. In 1951, she was appointed Vice-Chancellor of Kunming Teachers College. She has devoted her efforts to learn new educational ideas and teaching methods, implement the Party's education policy, and work hard for the young socialist generation. At the same time, they actively participate in social activities, regardless of their physical weakness. Every year, they go to remote troops to the countryside for condolences and surveys, to publicize the Party's policy and policy, unite educators, work hard for the cause of education, and provide advice and advice to the party and the Government. \\nQin shuzhen was elected a member of the Yunnan Provincial People's Committee in 1955. Participated in the China Democratic League in 1956 and served as a member of the NLD Provincial Committee. In early 1957, she set up the Yunnan branch of the China Association for the Promotion of Democracy in Kunming and was elected as a deputy to the National Women's Congress. In 1957, she was mistaken as the right. died in 1959. In 1979, the misalignment of the right was corrected.

They do not see the depth of the 'three hazards', and in the thick suffocating bureaucracy, the democracy of the people is becoming the term of history, and the freedom of the people is becoming irrevocable The current cheque, □□ sectarianism is dragging the Chinese Communist Party to the people's nobility Throne, vulgar dogmatism is eroding and stiffening the minds of the young generation! \\nThese poor worms are still relatively negative, and more positive are the guys holding an axe and stick, they are allowed to say 'rightly wise,' not to say 'wrong and stupid,' but to sing the light, not to expose the darkness... they really force people to praise them under their slaughter. 'Good quick force'! Force the morning warbler to turn singing under the cat's paw! \\nUnfortunately, many of these people are party members and some 'activists' trusted by the party, subdivided up. This part of the party members belong to a category that loves to listen to and flatter, and those 'activists' are members of the party members who flatter this part of the party. These two parts have long relied on the authority of the party. 'Union', dependent life. Sing high on top of the masses, sang 'from the masses to the masses', sang 'congenital worries and worries, after the world music', that empty crown words, actually play a set of tricks that confuse others! \\nWhat's more regrettable is that some of our leaders have blinded the eyes of some of our leaders. They trust this part of people more than trust the masses, promote this part of the people better than promote the masses, treat them as good friends to push their bellies and treat the masses as the object of vigilance at any time, the result is a flattering 'eunuch' Chandao's itchens break into the cold palace. \\nPut down your sticks!

However, the material that designated Qin xueren as a right-wing element was finally reported to the CCP Zhangye Land Committee. The situation was revealed to him by Guo Fasiao, who served as the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China's Dunhuang County Committee. Guo Fa-xiao committed suicide in November 1957."

It is better not to talk too much about the issue of another class. However, our comrade Liu Xueping looked at the article, but suddenly came black and said: 'Yesterday, no one has sent a note, and today others speak, you will deliver the rules!' What does 'you' mean here? There are only two words, but it's really sad! There is only one truth in our view-this speaker is Lu Sichao, a member of the team and judge of the class, who spoke in this study. \\nIt is even more scary to hear about another party member Chen Boliang who came up to speak, because someone said in his speech that our party branch was simply like a 'dark kingdom'; so it was slandering the Communist Party. Comrade Chen's logic is this: saying the 'dark kingdom' this includes the whole branch and the entire organization, and this organization is under the leadership of the school party committee, provincial party committee and central party committee, and slander this organization is to slander the party, no matter what the speaker says under what conditions the spokesman says, 'Darkness' 'Kingdom', whether Comrade Chen Buliang's logic came from there, only ask Comrade Chen why he should come with a big hat. Make conclusions. (Press: This article was published on 'Iron Tribulus'. At that time, Qin yanglvyang Lu criticized Qin yanglvyang Lu's myth of 'dark kingdom', so Qin yanglv wrote this article.), \\nFive female students in the fourth grade of the Chinese language\\nParty members to go out of the street, horse fart patrons\\nParty members called difficult, people sent grants to the door;\\nParty members said the movie was good, even busy buying movie tickets;\\nThe sky is raining, horse fart umbrella:\\nParty members take off coat, hands won't win. \\nThe masses of anger are high, the horse fart customers greet the water;\\nFrom heaven to earth, domestic to international;\\nSpeaking again, the whole afternoon has passed. \\nThe final conclusion is only one:\\n'The masses! Advice is good, positive attitude is the most important.' \\nParty members cried, horse fart condolences;\\nParty members said: 'The masses are too picky.' \\n'Only I know you best,' said the horse fart. \\nOne said, 'The opinion of the masses is over fire.' \\nAnother said, 'Right! Right! It's all personal emotions, negates everything.' \\nThe group will, deserted, the air is too dull. \\nParty members hum minor, horse fart whistle;\\nMinor plus whistle, into the big tone of democracy. \\nNo comments to mention, everyone adjourned."

In 1959, began to pick up a hat for the right, Shanghai publishing system in the first year only picked Xu Zhucheng (since Wenhui Bulletin's head head to the reading office of the Shanghai Publishing Bureau), and Li Xiaofeng (former president of Shanghai Fourlian Publishing House, and then deputy director of the editorial office of Shanghai Culture Publishing House), 2 People, only less than 1% of the number of people wearing caps in the publishing system. Xu Zhucheng is a 'foreign household', squeezed the number of publishing houses, the publisher actually had only one person picking the cap. These two people are well-known head-face figures, and the vast majority of the right are unknown paws, hoping to 'pick' and sigh. The second year increased to 5-6 people, but also limited to one digit. By 1961-1962, the number of cap-picking increased to double digits, although there are only 10 20, but it has made people feel that spring is becoming more intense. Not only this, but also to show that these right-wing 'return to the ranks of the people', in addition to giving the 'comrades' the advantages that are proportionate to 'comrades', were also allowed to appear in the newspaper and publish articles. \\nIf Xu Zhucheng picked his hat soon, he was able to be listed on the list of the funeral management committee of Yan Baoli, general manager of Wenhui Po, while the chairman member was Ke Qingshi, the first secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee at that time, and that was a high political treatment to Xu. Shen Zhiyuan, former director of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the NLD and economist, was also allowed to publish a discussion article on economic issues in the newspaper after picking his hat, which was also to restore his political treatment. Writer Wang Ruowang (formerly Editor-in-Chief of the Literary Monthly Newspaper), is also a 'big right'. After picking his hat, he was allowed to write essays with a pencil name. He dared to speak, wrote a 'praise small fire table', promoting 'big public and private', which caused controversy, but was not deeply studied, indicating that the policy was loose. The early picking of the right is not as worthless as it was later called 'hat-picking right', but rather when the matter was valued by everyone. The right, at least picked, uncapped, and intellectuals who did not wear a hat but seemed like a bow bird. \\nFour signs of loosening: In March 1962, the news that Enlai and Chen Yi were 'crowned' for intellectuals last week in Guangzhou meeting, leaving the caps of the bourgeois intellectuals, plus the crowning of the working people's intellectuals. Now it is known that two meetings were held in Guangzhou in March of that year: the National Conference on Science and the National Symposium on Drama, Opera and Children's Drama Creation. Zhou Enlai gave a speech on the issue of intellectuals to the representatives of the two conferences. But Chen Yi's speech was officially 'crowned off caps' for intellectuals. In Bo Yibo's 'Review of Several Major Decisions and Events' (next volume), Chen Yi first revealed two paragraphs of Chen Yi's speech. Chen Yi says:\\nThey are people's intellectuals, socialist scientists, people's laborers, brainstorm workers in the service of the proletariat. Workers, farmers, intellectuals are three components among the working people of our country, and they are masters. Not able to go through 12 years of transformation, test, and put the bourgeois intellectuals hat on the heads of all intellectuals, because it is not true. We advise all comrades who do the work of the Party, comrades who do administrative work, to carry out reflections in this regard and to have self-criticism. In the past, there has been no unity and understanding of them, many things have been done too rough and too hard. \\nI am the heart called precarious, do not dare to speak. I'm dying: this style does not change, very dangerous! We must improve this grave situation. The situation is very serious. Maybe this is my overexpenditure, so serious that everyone does not write an article, it is so serious that everyone can only speak well, this is not a good sign. In the future can only develop a glorious voice... dangerous! \\nAccording to Bo Yibo, after Chen Yi's speech, 'and solemnly walked a 'hat-off ceremony' to the attendees. 'There were more than 60 applause and laughter rang in the venue.' However, Chen Yi's speech was banned from communicating in Shanghai. Of course, the newspapers will not report, but the 'trail news' cannot be blocked and passed in the intellectual community. Although not completely passed, it is roughly the same. That's what I heard from historian Li Pingxin. Pingxin is a second-level professor at East China Normal University, often there are many internal news from the upper level. At first I didn't understand what it meant by 'crowning off the hat'. He explained for me, but the addition of the 'intellectuals of the working people' was mistaken as 'proletarian intellectuals', and the rumors were always not very accurate. \\nThe above few signs of loosening show that the political spring of an intellectuals is looming. Shanghai's intellectual community was clearly encouraged and became active for a time. In the middle, the Shanghai publishing community is both the meeting point for various fields of knowledge such as academia, culture and other fields, as well as the so-called 'crouching tiger' of new and old intellectuals, so it is more able to get the style first and make a positive response. The previous anti-Hu and anti-right struggle, as well as the cultural revolution later, the Shanghai publishing community were all disaster-hit areas, and it was no accident. \\nAt that time, I was editing at the Chinese Book Bureau in Shanghai. The editor hung the Chinese Book Bureau brand, but it is not related to each other with the Chinese Book Bureau in Beijing. Administration and business are independent, each with each other's books. Its predecessor is classical literature publishing house, behind it is today's Shanghai Ancient Book Publishing House. During the Cultural Revolution, China was 'smashed' and renamed the 'liberation publishing house', and the villains warriors said they wanted to 'liberate' this black nest, which preached feudal culture. Therefore, China's publishing house has a certain representation in the Shanghai publishing community and even academia. China's editorial director is Jin Zhaozi, deputy director and editor-in-chief Li Junmin, both scholars. Kim is a historian. Many primary and secondary school students from the Republic of the Republic of China probably read the Chinese history textbooks he wrote. After liberation, he was appointed as a deputy mayor of Suzhou City as a democratist. He was also vice president of the Shanghai Historical Society. He has all developed as members of China's editorial department 'right' elements.. Li was an old left-wing writer in the 30s and vice president of Shanghai Writers Association. He wrote a book of Li Bai Research, which was the first to study classical literature with a view of materialism. \\nIt is because the leadership of China is a scholar, usually there is a certain academic atmosphere. As soon as the political climate is slightly relaxed, the motivation of academic activities is immediately revealed. Publishers have a close relationship with academia, and some scholars and editors are mostly friends, and some are exchanging, and then several scholars were invited to give academic presentations. The campaign was unknown, but the fight against the right was interrupted by the time of the predecessor Classical Literature Publishing House, which was compiled in China. But without a relaxed environment, no matter who's advice or decision, it would be absolutely impossible to hold such a lecture. \\nThe first invited speaker was Tan Qixiang, the authority of Chinese historical geography, which officially became a discipline, and he was one of the founders. His editor-in-chief 'Atlas of Chinese History' is a must for readers of history. Under his chairmanship, Fudan University established the Institute of Historical Geography, which has trained a large number of young scholars. He came to China to make a presentation on the topic, 'History and Geography', which is his expertise. But there are also exotic words, expressing indignation at the current culture of learning that is cultivated by the foundation. After many years, I forgot the content of his speech, but he still remembered what he said. He said that now college students can't read ancient books and read words can't break sentences. How can this be done? Therefore, he advocates the publishing house to produce ancient books, more copies without punctuation, even if typography do not add punctuation, let the students themselves break the punctuation and give them the opportunity to exercise. He was an expert opinion and, of course, the publishing house could not do it completely. \\nThe second speaker was Zhou Yudong, who served as deputy director of the Shanghai Institute of History and offered a class of economics at Fudan University. He is an expert in the history of scripture, he commented on Pisiri's 'history of scripture' due to the broad provocation of the commentary, saying informative, has also become a famous book for the study of scripture. Zhou Yutong told us about 'History of Scripture'. All other words can't be remembered. Only one sentence he spoke about China's nation, but I was impressed. He said: 'I study the nation of China, the more I study the more I find it cute, take the mourning thing as a good event, the world is unique!' People who listened to laughed, and they were happy to laugh. Why? I think this is because Zhou Yu speaks so thoroughly with the Chinese philosophy of life from ancient times to the present (or known as the myriad philosophy), so he made an approving laugh. Of course, after laughing will cause another thought. \\nLiu Dajie is the third scholar to give a lecture. Liu is the author of the History of Chinese Literature and is a professor at Fudan University. In the early 50s, Li Pingxin was the focus of the reformation of ideas. Li was hit by the wooden stick brains, Liu jumped Suzhou River himself sank, and fortunately all were rescued, so the two were the same name. Zhou Yangji appreciates Liu's literary history, reprinted by the Classical Literature Press. He has become a must-read textbook for the Chinese Department of University, and Liu's reputation is growing. During the Great Leap Forward movement, young students responded to the call to break down superstitions, breaking down several influential literary history writings. On the basis of criticizing the literary history written by their teachers, Peking University students collectively prepared a red 'History of Chinese Literature' and put a satellite on the basis of the literary history written by their teachers. \\nIn Shanghai, students from the Chinese Department of Fudan University also criticized their teacher Liu Dajie's 'History of Chinese Literature', and over a month, collectively wrote another hundreds of thousands of characters of red 'History of Chinese Literature' and put a satellite. The students' approach was simple, and a red literary history was completed by extracting the preamble of some monographs and various books of classical literature, including criticized literary history, along with some Marxist-Leninist revolutionary phrases. Fudan Chinese students outperformed Peking University students and prepared a series of papers that criticize the History of Chinese Literature, which contains dozens of articles and published separately. The theme of Liu Dajie's speech in China is certainly inseparable from the history of Chinese literature. When he speaks of the so-called history of red literature published at the Great Leap Forward, he can't help but be excited to make astounding words that point out chapter by chapter of the plagiarism in these red books. I remember the epigram of his speech: 'I dare to assert that no word is not copied! Copy also curse people! It's like a thief pulled out your wallet and hit a stick on your head!' He was so quick to say what everyone wanted to say but dare to say. \\nSome of the statements made by these three gentlemen, according to the 1957 anti-right criteria, are undoubtedly anti-socialist right-wing statements. But time and climate is not the same, it is not surprising that everyone listened to laughing in the past. This shows again and again that the political atmosphere of this period can indeed be said to be relaxed. Otherwise, the Chinese leaders will never have the guts to hold such a liberalized academic lecture, and the speakers will never have the guts to expose their words so unscrupulously, lest they have no chance to speak again. Sure, a blink of an eye is mutant, but half a year, a cold tide struck, this speech will automatically stop immediately, and no one will mention it later. According to the theory of class struggle, speeches also belong to preparing public opinion for the restoration of the bourgeois. Fortunately, the scope is small and unnoticed, so it has not become a crime. The subsequent encounter of these three gentlemen in the Cultural Revolution, but they are different: Tan is seeking full and prudent to spend the day; Zhou was humiliated and criticized, broken down to death; Liu was met, and the courtesy had been added. This is about the fate of three different types of intellectuals of contemporary times. \\nIn this period, China has created an academic publication 'Chinese History Series'. The idea of creating this publication, which focuses on articles such as literature and history research and examination, as well as information, must come from above. Even if the political air is liberal, a small publishing house is afraid to advocate for such a 'old and present' publication on its own. At that time, there were some 'spirit' and verbal instructions passed through a layer of leadership (in fact, just a few words spoken by a central leader). The following immediately acted as an arrow and acted immediately. This is often the case in publishers. \\nFor example, Liu Dajie's 'History of Chinese Literature Development' was reprinted in the mid-50s, because of Zhou Yang's words. By the 1960s, Zhou Yang said that Tang Xianzu's poems could be published. The Chinese editorial immediately organized Xu Shuofang, Qian Nanyang, experts studying Tang Xianzu, and Qian Nanyang assigned to organize the school site of Tang Xianzu's poetry collection and opera collection, and soon published the book. \\nAnother time is said to be Kang Sheng said, Shandong has a copy of 'Talking Zhai Zhiyuan' is very valuable. China also quickly found this book, photocopy and publication. The fastest followed is a single printed 'Chinese live leaf text selection', which was originally to follow the enlightened book store 'enlightened living leaf text selection', North new book bureau 'beixin live leaf text selection' practice, selected chronicles of ancient poems, easy to read and buy for beginners, very popular by readers. As long as the top down, Chairman Mao mentioned what article, immediately annotated by the organizers or university teachers, or editors themselves. Like the 'Seven Hair', Song Yu 'Wind Fu', 'Post-Hanshu, Zhang Lu Chuan', and so on, are all rushed out in this way. Books published in this situation can also be cited. \\nSo the founding issue of the Chinese History Series, I want to come and come. At that time, the propaganda minister of the Shanghai Municipal Committee was Shi Ximin. The director of the Shanghai Publishing Bureau was Luo Zhufeng. The latter actively participated in and guided the preparation of this publication, presided over a symposium for scholars to solicit opinions. Luo Zhufeng said he wanted to uncover the old man's article in the bottom of the box. Some old scholars are not allowed to have a place to publish an article, naturally welcome. The most energetic is peace of mind, and he wrote the most articles for the Chinese History Series. The publication finally decided to send me as the responsible editor, with another assistant. Above me, Liu Baishan, whose title is editor, is de facto first editor-in-chief, but not signed. \\nHowever, this finale play of the Shanghai Spring is Luo Zhufeng's 'miscellaneous family' event, both the culmination of this play, and also announced that the play is about to sing. The song ended up, heralding that there will be another new play staged. Luo Zhufeng was deputy director of the Shanghai Religious Affairs Bureau. In 1957, Luo Zhufeng was reassigned as Director of Shanghai Publishing Bureau as the anti-right movement of the Shanghai publishing system approached the end. The editors of our publishers welcome him to serve as director for a simple reason. Although he has several levels of leadership relationship, he often listens to his report. He made the report, straightforward, very pleasant, sometimes with ejunctions and, above all, without any rebuking tone. It is not as long as some leaders do, it is not dragging the water and pushing people to fall asleep; that is, words that contain coercion, cause listeners to fear. Therefore, he made a report, everyone loves to hear, think this director is good. \\nOn the beginning and end of the event, one of the main parties in that year, Yu Xianzao, editor of the pen will be written by Wen Wei Po, a new memorial article entitled 'Yiluo Old Talks' ('Luo Zhu Wind Memorial Collection' published in November 1997).\\nIn the spring of 1962, Zhou Enlai and Chen Yi made speeches for intellectuals at the Guangzhou Conference. The culture and the press atmosphere was more active. 'People's Daily' and 'Beijing Daily' have opened up columns of 'Long and Short Records' and 'Yanshan Night Talk'. Wen Wei Po also held a symposium for authors of essays at this time. The meeting was moderated by Editor-in-Chief Chen Yusun. Director Luo was a veteran who started writing essays in the 30s. Of course, participants were Yu Minghuang, Jiang Wenjie, Wu Yunpu, Feng Gang and more than 10 others. Luo Lao spoke about, the essay may be a bit angular, a bit biased, not flat and stable, all-inclusive. Everyone thinks his words make sense, and they all recommend him to take the lead in writing. After the meeting, I wrote to him more than once. \\nShortly afterwards, I received an essay written by Luo's pseudonym, and attached a text message: 'These days, I walked to the publishing house, and talking to some editors, caused the impulse of writing, draft into a 'miscellaneous family' draft, please read the place.' The article takes the form of talking to an editor, suggesting that 'the editor is also a specialist-miscellaneous family', hoping to attract the attention of the leadership. In order to bring this article to the attention of the cultural community, we specifically arranged for the publication of the conference on May 6, 1962 on the opening day of the Conference. \\nThis is the origin of the 'miscellaneous family' article. Once the article saw the newspaper, immediately resonated in Shanghai's cultural and publishing circles, and many people agreed. Beijing also caused reactions. Xia Yan and others thought that the article raised questions. Remember that day I saw the essay from Wen Wei Bao in my office, saying, 'This 'Crosshouse' spoke for our editor, I don't know who it is?' This sentence was heard, on record, and later became one of my counts as a 'Luo Bamboo Drummer'. In the Cultural Revolution there was a 'big poison grass 'miscellaneous' cracking conference, I was also pulled to power, together with other 'drummers', to participate in the accompany fight. \\nThe 'miscellaneous family' incident eventually led Luo Zhufeng to lose his official position as director of Shanghai Publishing Bureau, and was relegated to make 'The Sea'. Just as Yao Wenyuan made trouble to Wen Wei Po in 1957, this time it was Yao Wenyuan's trouble again. He wrote 'The idea of two editors comrades' on the argument calling for editorial status, saying that he himself had made edits, 'but never produced a desolate sense of 'marry clothes for others''; at the end of the article referred to the 'miscellaneous family' argument 'seems familiar, seen in any place', 'So I went to the bookshelf, came up with a book...' cloud, seems to stop, suggesting that this is a 'right' speech, implicitly Kill. After Yao Wenyuan's article was published, the newspaper had received many letters to express their opposition, but the newspaper was afraid to publish it. \\nFinally, another essay writer Zheng Shifeng wrote an 'Intervention', playing 50 boards each with the voice of the guy, closing the debate. But the end of the event will wait until March of the following year \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), the Shanghai Municipal Committee held an ideological working meeting, which confirmed that the 'miscellaneous family' event was 'a revival of capitalism on the ideological front,' and that 'the publishing house slipped a crooked wind of capitalist liberalization', characterizing the event. At this meeting, he also criticized Chen Qiwu, deputy secretary of the propaganda department of Shanghai, and removed him to Yangzhou Agricultural College as party committee secretary. Chen and Luo Bamboo have a good deal, the reason for being approved for derogation does not know whether it is related to However, very active in the Shanghai Spring, Yu Minghuang, capitalized essays and several times went to the publishing system to report-according to the standard of that year, could be called 'poisoning'-but was not tied to the company, and later was also tasked with 'Liang Bihui' to write down the article 'ghost harmless', and died in the early days of the Cultural Revolution. It is visible fortunate to have misfortune. \\nA short and lively intellectuals spring, it came in such a hurry and went in a hurry. The end mark is the announcement of the 10th Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. Soon later, Liu Shuzhou, then head of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee of the United Front Committee, gave a report to the democrats, saying, 'Someone asked: Is spitting anywhere is a class struggle? Spitting is certainly not a class struggle, but if the person who raises this question, his motivation is intentionally provocative, that is class struggle.' As soon as you listen to these listeners, sitting in the rules below, the long cold winter has arrived. \\nIn recent years, a number of memoirs have been published, in particular some of Mao Zedong's manuscripts, which gives us an understanding of the historical background of the various stages of the past years. When making decisions at senior political levels in China, the knowledge of cadres and the masses can only rely on the level of communication and understanding the spirit. This spirit is often difficult to comprehend. Looking back at the easing period of 1961-1962, when people flourished and chaotic, but today, the historical context of that period is roughly clear. The Great Leap Forward and the failure of the People's commune prompted Mao Zedong to calm down and felt that there was a need for adjustment. 'Due to the failure of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune Movement for more than three years in a row, the construction of national production and people's lives have experienced serious difficulties. Comrades of the central leadership gradually calmed down and began to summarize lessons in a series of meetings. (Review of Major Decisions and Events)\\nIn early 1961, under the direction of Mao Zedong's initiative, the wind of research and research was raised. From January to May, he personally appointed a group of people to undergo a grass-roots investigation and write the investigation report. As on May 6, he sent letters to Li Jingquan and Chen Zhengren:\\nComrade Jing Quan: Why did you not write to me? I yearn for thy letters. Did you go to the investigation? ... please, in this half month, go to the countryside to do a serious investigation and research work, and keep me informed. Letters write casually, eclectic. This half month is hoping for a letter from you. If you send kindness and write to me, I will write back to you. (Mao Zedong Manuscript since its founding, vol. 9)\\nThe words in this letter are really earnest, increasing people's trust and demonstrating Mao Zedong's desire to know the true situation of his first people's commune. But later it turns out that, in the end, it is still a return to the 'established approach' of class struggle. According to the recollection of more than one person's relevant insurer, his secretary Tian Jiaying, who first accepted Mao Zedong's instruction to go to Zhejiang, Sichuan and other places to do research, came back to report verbal reports to him on the failure of the 'Great Leap Forward' everywhere. He was silent and could not. According to his habit, this is the expression of his mind. Since this field Jiaying has been alienated. Lu Dingyi said in his article 'commemorating the 90th birthday of Comrade Mao Zedong' in response to this 'survey study':\\nWhy did Comrade Mao Zedong, who initiated research and research and seek truth, forgot the ideas he promoted. Until behind him, it was not restored by the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee? \\nThis is, first of all, of course, because the whole party has no experience in socialist construction. In addition, because Comrade Mao Zedong is proud of it, he is not listening to the negative opinion. His conversation to Snou argued that there was a need for personal worship. Three, because he is old, even if he wants to do systematic and thoughtful research, it is already hard to do. \\nThe three lessons drawn up by Lu Dingyi (especially the latter two), are clearly the conclusions reached after his own painful personal experience. According to the Bo wave's report, this Lu Ding had a different opinion about the March 1962 meeting in Guangzhou for 'crowning' intellectuals, causing Zhou Enlai repeatedly to justify, saying that he was 'reporting on behalf of the Party and was approved by the Party.' However, Mao Zedong did not take a position on their arguments, saying, 'Some of the bourgeois intellectuals have come over, but the spirits have not been dispersed, and some have not even come over.' It makes people feel untouched. But there is no doubt that Mao Zedong's approach to removing the bourgeois intellectuals once agreed, but eventually disagreed. Lu Dingyi is a very tight person who follows Mao's thinking, and is not as enlightened as Chen Zhou on the issue of intellectuals. Until the Cultural Revolution, I had a great hardship, lucky nine dead life, survived, only gradually realized it. \\nBut the winds of research and research in 1961 still have positive aspects, which led to the '7,000 people conference' from the end of 1961 to early 1962 and the subsequent Guangzhou Conference. Mao Zedong called for everyone at the 7,000 people congress to 'go out during the day and watch the play at night', and made a little statement of responsibility; Chen Yi and Zhou Enlai's speech for intellectuals at the Guangzhou meeting must have been instructed or received his approval beforehand. These initiatives have created a respite or recovery period in industrial and agricultural production, ideologically a relative easing period, or a brief spring of intellectuals, as described in this paper, giving intellectuals a fire of hope. There was also much publicity in promoting the convening of a so-called 'immortal society' to encourage business and industry and democratic parties to speak out. For a time, many people were unspoken again, saying three and four words. \\nBut the spring of this ideology is destined to be short-lived again. Because even since January 20, 1961, Mao Zedong wrote a letter on organizing three groups to study to Tian Jiaying (Mao Zedong Manuscript since its founding, vol. 9), until August 1962 at the Beidaihe Conference (the preparatory meeting of the 10th Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee), A renewed call to class struggle, declaring that 'retreat is needed now. Leaving the class struggle does not make sense. 'Without speaking class, class struggle, there is no strength' (according to the thin wave). There are only 1 year and 7 months of moonlight around this spring. But I have to say that the spring is shorter, there is always a spring better than no spring, so for this reason. \\n(Chamber City 'Asked Sense Collection' Shanghai Ancient Book Publishing House published 2011, price 21 yuan.

It is said that when Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House published 'said Yue Quan Biography', the first printing set a number that was very conservative at the time-900,000 copies!

Nowadays he is nearly 90 years old, but not only is he clever, widely reading books and newspapers, concerned about publishing information and academic developments, but also 'Avatar', 'Pirates Dream Space' and other film blockbuster films, even at two o'clock in the morning of this year's World Cup, refueling Spain. Mr. Qian has always said that the editor is a miscellaneous house and is interested in everything. Perhaps for him, today's fulfilling life is the extra benefit of decades of editorial career. \\nIn the early 1980s, there was a book shortage in the country. This is related to the stagnation of publishing during the Cultural Revolution. So what about the pre-Cultural Revolution publication situation? \\nHYPERLINK \\http://hihistory.net/tag/%e9%92%b1%e4%bc%af%e5%9f%8e/\\\\\\ o 'View all articles in Chamber City'\\\\ t '_blank' Chamber City: before the Cultural Revolution That kind of movement. I was beaten as the right when I was against the right, and now the mockery is called 'misdrawing.' At that time, there were six right-wing groups, which accounted for just 1/10 of the staff of the whole community, in line with the upper limit of the right-wing ratio at that time. At that time, all units were on the proportional ceiling to catch the right. We also played a small 'counter-revolutionary' group in our house. I am the coach. Mr. He Manzi was a military division, and Chen Wenjian, a young young man at that time, was a pioneer. Now the military division and pioneer have passed away. Only my coach is left. \\nAfter the end of the right, there was a brief spring in the publishing industry. In 1962, the publishing house (then named the Shanghai Editorial Office of the Chinese Book Bureau), founded the Chinese History Series. As the right-wing, I edited the academic publication, and also equipped with an assistant. However, in 1966, the Cultural Revolution began, and the seventh series of the Chinese History Series was already in line, but dare not out, because there is an article by Mr. Li Pingxin, Professor of History Department of East China Normal University. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, the then Shanghai Municipal Committee launched a mobilization meeting in the Cultural Square, throwing up eight counterrevolutionary academic authorities, including Zhou Gucheng and Zhou Yu, Li Pingxin is one of them. Yao Wenyuan said in his critical article that he 'himself jumped out of the counter-revolutionary clown'. He was not humiliated and committed suicide. \\nAfter the end of the Cultural Revolution, there was a hot reading and publishing fever soon. Can you talk about the specific performance of that time? \\nChamber City: The heat of reading after the Cultural Revolution is caused by the shortage of books and knowledge. You see our 'Chinese History Series' published in 1979, with the highest print count of 45,000 copies (because of Hu Shi's article), with a minimum of 25,000 copies. We sent out the new book notice, the Xinhua Bookstore feedback back is our number of prints. At that time, readers bought 'Dream of the Red House' and 'Water Margin' had to line up overnight. At that time, the timber was very valuable, someone took the 'Water Margin', 'Red House Dream' can go directly to the countryside to buy wood. We have a book of Mr. Wang Bijiang's Tang Novel, because the title of the book has the word 'novel' and also sold very well, many people do not know that this is a verbal novel. At that time, employees were privileged to buy books, but this popular book could only buy two copies per person. \\nAt that time, many scholars did not rehabilitate or restore their reputation. Are there any resistance to publishing their books? \\nHYPERLINK \\http://hihistory.net/tag/%e9%92%b1%e4%bc%af%e5%9f%8e/\\\\\\ o 'View all articles in Chamber City'\\\\ t '_blank' Chamber City: resistance is still there, but mainly reflected in the publishing house themselves  At that time, the superiors did not have any specific notice, just to see whether the publishing house had the courage and eyesight. There was no first-level review panel at that time, and books did not need to be submitted for trial. Publication in the 1980s was mainly self-discipline, and everyone felt it was responsible for keeping the land. \\nI went back to Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House in 1978 from the factory 'War High Temperature', to the editorial room of the literature and history series, with a copy of 'To the reader', the original was written by me. The reissue issued Mr. Li Pingxin's article, which is HyperLINK 'http://hihistory.net/tag/%E6%96%87%E9%9D%A9\\\\\\ o 'Cultural Revolution'\\\\ t '_blank' written before the Cultural Revolution, but this time added 'legacy' Two words. There is also Mr. Chen Yin Ke's 'On the Edge of Regeneration'. This article was not published in mainland China before Mr. Zhang Shizhao was ordered to go to Hong Kong, and when he went to Sun Yin Sen University to meet Mr. Chen Yinke, Chen gave him oil stamps, and the Hong Kong side circulated. We later published it on the basis of oil stamps in 1979. \\nMr. Chen Yin Ke's article begins with a second paragraph after the quote, 'Yin Ke' is written in the top format. At that time, there was an editor in the editorial room that came out of the newspaper, and according to the rules of the newspaper, insisted that 'Yin' could not be top. I fought with him and always went to Luo Zhufeng (Luo had just implemented the policy, delegated to the press on standby and asked him to be one of the editors-in-chief of the Chinese History Series). He did not pay much attention to these details and gave no specific comments. Finally, with my insistence, I finally typed in the format of Mr. Chen Yinke's text. \\nOf course, no books can come out. None of the scholars who do not have rehabilitation can publish an article or publish a book, and the above approval is required for publication. We are under pressure to publish Hu Shi's legacy 'School-based Study of Water Notes'. We took the report to the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee and asked the deputy minister in charge in person to order before issuing it. In addition, there are their own methods, such as the 'wise leader Hua Guofeng' in the publication notes, pushing responsibility to the 'Gang of Four'. \\nThe work of the publishing house has also been helped by many scholars.

He said that Mr. Zhu was the English teacher he was studying in Nantong middle school. He had the friendship of teachers and students, knew his academic ethics and asked him the most appropriate. We asked Mr. Zhu to be the editor-in-chief, and no penny editor-in-chief. He never intervened in each issue and fully respected our opinion. \\nMr. Gu Tinglong has helped us very much. He is the librarian of Shanghai and has a good relationship with us. In the pre-liberation library, a lot of things was hidden. Mr. Gu served as curator and later became a collection of books in the Shanghai Library. We punctuation the research materials of modern history that Mr. Gu loaned to us from the library's books. Now, if you borrow it, the basic fee will not have to be. Mr. Hu Shi's letters and legacy were also received from him. Many of our book titles are also asked to sign us. \\nAlso, Mr. Wang Yuanhua, after the Cultural Revolution, he first moved to the Encyclopedia Publishing House as deputy editor. He has always been very interested in ancient books and is familiar with us. He studied 'Wenxin Carving Dragon', 'Dragon' became the school of the time. Later, he pushed to set up an ancient book planning and finishing group. His office was placed in Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House, with 200,000 yuan of funding each year, which he personally led Wei Tongxian and I to the city to apply. At the end of the 80s, we planned to publish overseas Chinese studies series. We asked Mr. Wang Yuanhua to be the editor-in-chief, but the editor-in-chief of the time was listed and not even the editing fee. This book is very influential, and is the first time after the Cultural Revolution to introduce and publish overseas Chinese books on a relatively large scale in the country. \\nCan you talk about the composition and interaction with scholars at that time? \\nHYPERLINK \\http://hihistory.net/tag/%e9%92%b1%e4%bc%af%e5%9f%8e/\\\\\\ o 'View all articles in Chamber City'\\\\ t '_blank' Chamber City: I've been to Beijing Many times, two of them were an assistant to Mr. Wang Yuanhua, for his editor-in-chief of the Encyclopedia Chinese literature volume. Some well-known old scholars such as Zhu Guangqian, Tang Tao and Mr. Wang Yao have come a lot. For the publishing house, he mainly visited Yang Xiangkui, Luo Ergang, Qian Zhongshu, Yang Jiang, Lin Geng, Ji Zhenhuai and other gentlemen. The policy was implemented at that time, and some of them had been accommodated in vice-minister residences, and the floor of the rooms was paved with marble. Remember to visit Mr. Qian Jung-shu, who is preparing a statement in the living room and writing an outline in English in a notebook to attend the Pan Pacific Conference. See us, immediately put down our work, warm reception, and invite Mr. Yang Jiang to come out and meet together. Mr. Yang also sent me a copy of the famous Spanish title, 'The Little Tumbler', which she has just translated and published. \\nSeveral publishing houses in Beijing are our peers, of course, close ties. People's Publishing House, People's Literature Publishing House, Chinese Book Bureau, Sanlian Bookstore, etc., I have a must go every trip to Beijing, I also met many friends, and through them, expanded our contacts with academia for our publishing house. \\nWe feel that the focus of publishing at that time was on data collection, collation, republication of old works by well-known scholars, translation and introduction of foreign academic works, and relatively few original academic works in China, is it like this? \\nChamber City: After the Cultural Revolution, the intellectual community was encouraged by the phrase 'reading no restricted area'. I remember this is the first statement that Zhou Yang said after experiencing the pain of the cultural revolution. There is no idea that there is still a forbidden area for publishing, there are also restricted areas, all kinds of tangible and intangible strips and boxes that limit the heads of the publishers. Until 2005, Shanghai hosted the National Book Fair, selected the 'Top Ten Good Books' recommended to readers. I did a statistic and wrote a comment on the Beijing Daily. This 'top ten good books', translated abroad accounted for seven kinds, China accounted for only 3 kinds, and Taiwan in China accounted for one, and all of the old books were reprinted. This also largely reflects the situation in academia for a considerable period of time, and there may be little improvement at present. While responsibility cannot be left entirely to academia or publishers, it cannot be assumed that there is no responsibility. The academic stagnation during the Cultural Revolution is true, in fact, for a long time. \\nAccording to current standards, publishing at that time was not very standard, such as not signing a publishing contract with the author, not paying attention to the promotion and marketing of books, and employee income was not related to the good or bad of the publishing house, but many people felt that the books published in the 1980s were relatively high quality. So the publishing industry in the 80s can be prosperous? What is the reason for the flourishing? \\nHYPERLINK \\http://hihistory.net/tag/%e9%92%b1%e4%bc%af%e5%9f%8e/\\\\\\ o 'View all articles in Chamber City'\\\\ t '_blank' Chamber City: it was really not so Normative, generally is to write a letter to the author, the author promised to not sign the contract. Not much attention is paid to book advertising either. I once went to Beijing to organize a draft, to see Mr. Fan Yong, president of the People's Publishing House. I told him that the book ads in the 30s were so well written, very refined, people wanted to buy at a glance, and now they couldn't see a book ad. Mr. Fan Yung immediately pulled out a copy of a pile of 30s advertisements, let me write an article, I wrote it in the guest house where I live, with the pseudonym 'Xin Yu' on 'Reading'. Later at the first publication working conference in Changsha after the reform and opening up, Mr. Fan used the article as an introduction and distributed in brochures along with many books advertised in the 1930s. \\nAt that time, there was no lot of advertising for books. One time would cost 1,2,000 yuan. Many editors felt that books could not be advertised. Our company still insisted that every month in the 'Guangming Daily' advertisement to introduce new books, so far has not been interrupted. Many publishers now pay attention to book advertising, and the Chinese Reading Newspaper often has large book advertisements. But don't pay much attention to the words and points, some only book title and no author name, some translation books have only author name and no translator name, some come up with a president or editor-in-chief how to 'rate all employees', high, even a little bit of courtesy terms don't care. \\nAs for the boom in publishing in the 80s, I see it can only be relative. Just after a decade of havoc, everything has recovered, everyone relieved a breath, there was a vigorous push, publishing went up. \\nMany publishing houses have been in trouble in the 90s, compared with the 80's, what is the main reason for the decline? \\nHYPERLINK \\http://hihistory.net/tag/%e9%92%b1%e4%bc%af%e5%9f%8e/\\\\\\ o 'View all articles in Chamber City'\\\\ t '_blank' Chambers: I see two main points : The first is that in the process of transition of the socialist market economy, the press cannot adapt to the requirements of both social and economic benefits. To be confessed, in the past, Chinese publishers, in the name of the state and government, called for intellectuals selfless dedication, low draft fees and low pay, and a large book was published. Now, although the country also has a lot of subsidies and support for large publications, but a lot of money is spent on conference fees and travel costs, and the basic cost is increasingly higher, and the actual cost of the author's manuscript is still relatively low. The second is that the owners of publishing houses also seem to have to strengthen the idea of publishing. Consider the 1930s publishing house as an example, business printing library, enlightened bookstore and life bookstore are representatives of that era publishing house, each with a generation of learning and leading academic trends as their mission. In large provinces and cities throughout the country set up twenty branches, branches, commercial printing libraries and calling for a new book every day, and in several large newspapers such as the 'Declaration', 'The News' and other big newspapers published a large piece of 'Daily One Book' advertisement recommended by famous artists, truly achieved the combination of social and economic benefits. \\nWe have such a good environment and conditions for today's publishing house, and we must have such ambition. Of course, there are some problems that cannot be entirely blamed for publishing houses. The competent department should give the publishing house a relaxed and tolerant environment, and let the publishing house be loose and less prescribe. I think the tighter, tighter, tighter censorship of books now is not a good phenomenon. If publishing houses are given full autonomy and initiative, they can make many large good books. For example, the school site of the Chinese Book Bureau, 'Twenty-Four History', the Shanghai Leecho Publishing House's 'Cai Hai' is revised every 10 years, and the basic series of classical literature in Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House has been produced by 100 kinds. These large books are all made little by the publishing house on its own power. \\nYou have been the editor in chief for nearly 10 years at the publishing house, and you still care about publishing after you drop back, there's always some feeling. Can you talk? \\nChamber City: ashamed, vigorously small, almost no sense of achievement, left only a whole lot of regret. I admire Mr. Chen Yuan, who withdrew from the post of Chief Editor of the Commercial Press Library and published a set of articles in the internal press, citing the great regret that he wanted to do while in office. I would like to replicate a few regrets: first, although an index editing room was set up, in an atmosphere of general disregard for indexing work (especially the four-angle number), it was discarded. Second, the promotion of photocopying work at the beginning, but led the whole society to mistaken into a 'photocopying universal' publishing shortcut, and finally trying to reverse it was also powerless. Third, the original imagination of a new set of four edition-based series like the business printing library and the four new, pragmatic prerequisites like China, have not been realized. \\n(Oriental Morning Post, December 1, 2010)\\n"

				"memoirContent": "[Attached 3] Gao Keqin: 'Talking about the Old Editor of Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House' (Shanghai Century Publishing (Group), Co., Ltd. 2016.10.23)\\nIn 2016, the 60th anniversary of the founding of Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House. Looking back at Ijizi, the Ancient Society not only published a large number of high-quality ancient books and academic works, but also a lot of excellent editors, scholars, can be described as talents. The current President, Mr. Gao Keqin, is also very concerned about the history and anecdotes of celebrities. He has read a large collection of archives and wrote many articles on this. This time, the reporter asked him to talk about the style of those hard-working old editors. \\nShanghai Ancient Books Publishing House was founded on talents, can you introduce it? \\nGao Keqin: Shanghai ancient books publishing house (hereinafter referred to as 'the ancient'), history, we generally trace the classical literature publishing house established on November 1, 1956, the earlier basis is the new art publishing house of Chinese classical literature editing group. After the establishment of New China, some important publishers moved from Shanghai north and left in Shanghai for a merger and transformation: On June 1, 1952, four private publishing institutions including Haiyan Bookstore, Xinqun Publishing House, Guo Moruo's Quanyi Publishing House, Da Fu Publishing Company, etc., were reorganized on June 1, 1952. Cheng's new art publishing house was established, positioning as a 'national publication of Chinese and foreign modern literary works Literary Professional Publishing House', located at 83 Kangping Road. This is the first public-private professional publishing agency in New China. Its specifications are very high. The first president was Liu Xuewei, then director of the propaganda department of the East China Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, and editor-in-chief is literary theorist Wang Yuanhua. In October 1953, Li Junmin took over as president of the new art publishing house, and he just resigned as Director of Culture of Jiangsu Province to work in Shanghai. The new deputy president of New Arts Publishing House is Yusi, who served as head of the Secretariat of the Third Field Army Command, was the foreign language secretary of the third field army, followed by Li Junmin as president of Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House in 1978. New Arts Publishing House is also a place of crouching, and some people come from Haiyan bookstore, such as the ancient editors Mr. Wang Mian and Mr. Chamber City, who are in the classical literary editorial group. \\nLi Junmin just went to the New Arts Publishing House and encountered the first grievous case of the new Chinese literature scene, the 'Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group' case. Because the leadership of New Literary and Art Publishing House and many editors have had contacts with Hu Feng, he was more positive about Hu Feng's literary views and creations, and published the works of Hu Feng and his colleagues. Therefore, the new literary publishing house is known as the 'main position' of the Hu Feng group. In 1955, the 'material about Hu Feng Group' published in 1955 is Wang Yuanhua, Luo Luo, Zhang Zhongxiao and so on. Liu Xuewei, who has been redeployed as deputy director of the Social and Cultural Administration of the Central Ministry of Culture, and Peng Baishan, who was then minister of propaganda department of the East China Bureau of the Communist Party of China, was also beaten as 'Hu Feng elements' for having had links with Hu Feng and suffered persecution \\nAlso implicated are Meilin, Yu Hongmo and others, who have also been subjected to unfair scrutiny. Suicide attempted during Yu Hongmo's review, and finally killed suicide in the 'Cultural Revolution'. Geng Yong was also arrested, and his wife could not change dramatically, jumping the Huangpu River to commit suicide. In carrying out the instructions of his superiors to carry out the campaign against Hu Feng, Li also took the principle of justice and protected some of the editors involved, such as famous translator Wu Yan (Sun Jia-jin), as well as the subject. Also, Mr. He Manzi, was just better with Hu Feng's friend Mr. Jia Zhifang, and was beaten as 'Hu Feng molecule'; after examination, Li Junmin took him into the classical literature publishing house. \\nOut of love for classical Chinese literature, Li Junmin established the Chinese Classical Literature Editorial Group at the New Arts Publishing House. In November 1956, on the basis of this group, the Classical Literature Publishing House was established, and he is president and editor in chief. The editors of Classical Literature Publishing House, in addition to Qianbocheng and Wang Mian from the original editorial group of classical Chinese literature, have also transferred old publishers Wang Yuanfang, Liu Zemin and Hu Daojing, as well as Meilin, Yu Hongmo and He Manzi who are implicated in the 'Hu Feng case'. He also mobilized his old friend Liu Baishan, then director of history at North Jiangsu Normal College (the predecessor of Yangzhou Normal University), and Yu Zaichun, associate professor of the Chinese Department of Nanjing University. These are editors who are creative and researched. Therefore, although there are only a dozen editors at the editorial department, they are talented people. He Manzi once wrote in the Xinmin Evening News, saying: Jun old 'often says that he advocates the 'talent cabin', privately and inadvertently said: our team is competent to run a college Chinese department.' \\nAfter the 'Hu Feng case,' he met the reverse right again. The Classical Literature Society has a total of 60 people, according to 10%, hit six right-wing groups, including Qian bocheng, Ho Manzi, Wang Mian and so on. \\nFrom 1956 to 1966, although there were various political movements, there were still a lot of good books, laid the brand foundation for the future establishment of Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House and a reserve of talents. For example, Qian's 'Han Chang Li Poetry Collection', Deng Guangming's 'Jiaxuan Word Chronicle Notes', Hu Daojing's Dream Creek Pen Talk Card, Chen Qiyou's 'Han Feizi New School Note', etc. More influential are three sets of popular readings: 'Selected Chinese Living Leaf Literature', 'Selected Reading of Classical Chinese Literature', 'Basic Knowledge of Chinese Classical Literature'. There's a lot of effort under these popular readings. For example, in order to do the 'Tang Poem 100', the company first printed hundreds of trial copies for a wide consultation, ranging from Politburo members Kang Sheng, Chen Boda, Shanghai city leader Ke Qingshi, down to printing factory workers. In the end, millions of copies were sold. \\nIn the old leadership of Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House, there is a troika saying, can you talk about the situation of these three? \\nGao Keqin: In June 1958, under the unified planning of the ancient books finishing and publishing planning group of the State Council, the original Shanghai Publishing Bureau of Classical Literature Publishing House and China Book Bureau Shanghai Office merged to set up the Chinese Book Bureau Shanghai Editorial Office (hereinafter referred to as 'China on the book'), then nearly 70 Mr. Jin Zhaozi Director of Deputy Editor of Chinese Book Bureau, Li Junmin, Chen Xiangping, Qi Ming Qu is deputy director. Jin Zhaozi is an old publisher, after he came to China, he also served as the curator of Shanghai literature and history. Therefore, in the 1960s, there were three professional publishing houses engaged in ancient books collation, the Chinese Book Bureau, and the People's Literature Publishing House, since the People's Literary Publishing House only had the Department of Classical Literature engaged in this work, there were 'two and a half' said. Li Junmin and Chen Xiangping and Qi Mingqu are also members of the Party of China's Upper Division. Among them Li Junmin is secretary, the three of them formed the 'troika' of the Chinese leadership team. \\nThe 100-year-old Chinese Book Bureau, in fact, is divided into two paragraphs. The creation figure is Lu Feikui, the first head after the reorganization in 1958 is Jin Canran. Speaking of this, Jin Canran was also a student of Li Junmin when he taught in Shandong in the 1930s. In the past 60 years, except during the 'Cultural Revolution', its book direction and head were almost identical. The soul figure for more than 30 years was Li Junmin. He was named Li Shouzhang, Zi Junmin, Nantong, Jiangsu. The ancient people hailed him as the old, a legendary character. In 1923, he was admitted to the Department of Chinese Literature at Wuchang Higher Normal School. The teacher is Yu Dafu, can be said to be a literary youth. He joined the Communist Party of China since 1925 and worked under the leadership of two Chinese Communist Party founders Dong Biwu and Chen Tanqiu. In May 1927, he was the Vice Minister of Propaganda Department of Wuchang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, responsible for the local Youth League magazine. So, Li Jun old is both an old revolution and an old publisher. After the defeat of the Revolution, he returned to Nantong and other places to participate in the clandestine struggle led by the Party. In addition, in September 1930, he also participated in the North 'Left Union' (and Luo Zhufeng, who later served as acting director of the Shanghai Municipal Publishing Bureau), as secretary general. He is also engaged in academic research. He published Li Bai Research in 1930, an earlier exploration of ancient writers with a view of material history. In 1936, Junlao and Yu Zaichun, Gu Minyuan, Jiang Shangqing, Jiang Shufeng Brothers and others co-organised the monthly 'Writing and Reading' magazine, which focuses on the reform of language teaching and promoting progressive ideas. During the anti-Japanese war and the liberation war, Junlao served as deputy commander of the 'United Resistance' force in North China, the Governor of Zishi County, Minister of Propaganda Department of the Fourth Army of Soviet Central China, and deputy commissioner of the ninth military subdistrict of the Soviet Union. After the establishment of New China, he has served as Director of Culture and Education of the North Suzhou Administration Administration, Director of Culture Bureau of Jiangsu Province, and head of Jiangsu Provincial Cultural Bureau in October 1953 to Shanghai as president of New Arts Publishing House, and since then began his publishing career for more than 30 years. \\nChen Xiangping is also an old revolutionary, old publisher. He was originally named Chen Zengshan, a Baoshan man from Shanghai. Joined the Communist Party of China in February 1938. In July the following year, commissioned by the Party, entered the 'Southeast Daily' (Jinhua Edition), sponsored by the Kuomintang (Jinhua Edition), editor-in-chief 'pen backer', cleverly using the enemy's propaganda position, spread progressive ideas, propaganda anti-Japanese, exposing darkness, at that time in Zhejiang, South Anhui, Gandong, Fujian and southern Fujian. Great impact. The main contributors of 'Pen Lei' are famous newspaper people Chen Yusun, Jiang Wenjie, Writer He Yi, Chen Youqin and others. In addition to uniting a group of progressive literals (many of whom became the author of the publication later), Chen Xiangping also found and cultivated some young talents, the most famous of which is Cha Liangyong, the famous Jin Yong. At that time, Chaliangyong was 17 years old, was a senior student of Quzhou middle school. Chen Xiangping found a prose written by Cha Liangyong from his writing, 'Things Can Be Crazy Young'. This article is sharp and energetic, and Chen Xiangping appreciates the rest of his concern about the author's situation. He changed the signature to 'Charlie' and published the article. This is the first article by Cha Liangyong. Soon, Chen Xiangping traveled from Jinhua to neighboring Quzhou on a business trip to visit 'Charlie'. As a result, the two became forgettable. Later, Chen Xiangping published several articles by Cha Liangyong. In the summer of 1943, Cha Liangyong admitted to Chongqing's Chengchi University, and still maintains a correspondence with Chen Xiangping. In the summer of 1946, Cha Liangyong was unable to continue studying because of his family defeat, wanted to go to Hangzhou to seek a job, wrote to Chen Xiangping asking for job introduction. After the victory of the resistance war, 'Southeast Daily' soldiers divided two ways, all the way in Shanghai as the head office, edited by Chen Xiangping, edited by Chen Xiangping, Changchun, all the way back to Hangzhou, established a branch to continue publishing. After looking at Cha Liangyong's letter, Chen enthusiastically recommended Cha Liangyong to Wang Yuanhan, editor of Hangzhou's Southeast Daily. This recommendation made Cha Liangyong smoothly stepped into the door of the press, thus allowing China to have one more famous newspaper person. In that year, Cha Liangyong entered the Southeast Daily as a translator. His job was to include international news broadcasts in English and prepare international press releases. A year later, he left Hangzhou for Shanghai to work as a translation editor for Time&Tide magazine, which was also recommended by Chen Xiangping. Soon after, Cha Liangyong took the country's famous 'Grand Communiqué' and was awarded the post of journalist. The following year, Dai Gao set up a branch in Hong Kong, and Cha Liangyong was sent to. In his later years, Jin Yong wrote an article in the Biography of Celebrity, recalling his days in the Southeast Daily, and sincerely said: 'In the 1940s I published an essay in the southeast daily 'Pen Backer', presided over by Chen Xiangping. Chen Xiangping is a courageous person who insists on the truth, and people want to kill him, he is not afraid, and has given me a lot of inspiration. Therefore, I worked hard to do a newspaper in Hong Kong and prepared for the sacrifice of my life. I can't say success, just feel that my life's luck is good. It can be said that when I met Mr. Chen Xiangping was my luck, he taught me how to read books, how to write, how to do people...' You can say that Chen Xiangping is the first enlightenment teacher in Jin Yong's newspaper and engaged in writing. \\nQi Mingqu, Zhejiang Shangyu people. He was the old revolution, the old soldier. Joined the Communist Party of China in 1938. After the 'founding of the nation', he became a volunteer army logistics ministry political committee. He was awarded the rank of Colonel in 1955. In February 1957, he was transferred to the 13th Air Force Factory as party secretary, and soon transferred to the classical literature press. After the establishment of China, he was deputy director and deputy editor. Since February 1980, he is also editor of Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House. Together with Junlao, he implemented the intellectuals policy and done a great deal of work. In just half a year, he made a thorough reversal and correction for more than 40 comrades. In addition to party affairs work, Qi Mingqu also participates in the business work of China. As deputy editor-in-chief and head of the selection research group of the editorial department, he presided over the editing and review of popular books, knowledge series and 'Chinese living leaves'. He organizes editors, especially young editors to study 'Three History' (General History of China, History of Chinese Literature, History of Ancient Chinese Thought); lectures by experts and scholars, such as Jin Zhaozi, Xie Guozhen's history, Xia Chengtao, and liven up the academic air. Mr. Chamber City, who has worked with him for decades, said in his memorial article: 'His classical literature is quite rich and knowledgeable. He can offer insightful insights to judge the essence and misery of ancient books, often admired by professional editors. He attaches special importance to the task of popularizing classical literature. He believes that this is an important means of cultivating national culture and improving the cultural quality of the people. Therefore, it is necessary to do the selection, description and annotations, to select the best works, prepare correct and detailed instructions and annotations, so as to recommend them to the general audience.' In addition to popularizing books, he also values the works of old experts and scholars. In May 1962, he visited Mr. Chen Yin Ke during his trip to Guangzhou and learned that Mr. Chen was writing 'Qian Liu Yuan Poetry Interpretation' (later renamed 'Liu Ru is not biography'). Mr. Meng Chen agreed. \\nShanghai Ancient Books Publishing House also has the 'four editors' saying, which are the four? \\nGao Keqin: Qiu Zhuchang, Lu Zhenbai, Liu Baishan, Yu Zaichun four were approved by the Shanghai Publishing Bureau in the early 1960s as editors, responsible for the review of manuscripts, was called the 'Four Editors' by the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences Publishing House in 2001. There are their legends. But since some of them died earlier, others had little written, that their deeds and achievements were not well known. \\nQiu Zhuchang (1906-1990), pen name Qiu Zhong, Yuyao, Zhejiang. He was the oldest of the four editors, but not from classical literature, but entered the altar as a new poet, with translators, mainly by Jack London's 'Seawolf' 'Poison Day' and Delesse's 'financier', 'Carrie sister' and so on. In 1945, Qiu Zhu Changjin Shanghai News Center was editor. Later, Chairman, Editorial Board, News Daily Information Supplement. He joined the China Democratic League in 1953. He was the head of the NLD branch of the News Daily. 1960 was an editorial editor of China. Retired in 1970. In his old age, he sang peace with his fellow fellow friends Lou Shiyi, old colleague Lu Zhenbai and other poems. In 1979 and 1980, he was appointed as an Associate Fellow at the Institute of Literature of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. \\nLu Zhenbai (1907-1984), the original name, the word Zhen white, after the word line, and also the word Bozi, Jiangxi Jiujiang people. His father was the culprits, had served as an official in Nantong, Jiangsu Province, Zhen Bai, was the fourteenth year, praying Yuan Zhang Wu as a master, learning ancient poetry, laid a solid foundation for national studies. He is proficient in poetry and talented. Chen Julai also put Lv Zhenbai and poet Fao Xiao Lu, Shen Jianzhi, Pan Boying, Painter White Plantain, Seal Carver Deng Shanmu, Calligraphy appraiser Xu Bangda and so on and called the 'Ten Mad Man'. Lv Zhenbai, in his old age, is still very high. Relations with Long Yusheng are very good. Lu Zhen Bai Xi prizes back into, mention Zhang Peiheng, Huang Yongnian and so on. For those who did not learn, he was sniffing. Lu Zhenbai directed students very seriously, strict requirements for students, often said: 'I can not mistaken my children, to be worthy of the ancestors, the next worthy grandchildren.' One day, he reviewed a master's thesis at a school's ancient book institute and said to my classmate Chen Mai-qing: 'In terms of labor, it may be possible to grant a master's degree; in academic terms, there is no invention', and he intends to write this in the commentary. Mak Qing asked the reason, it turned out to be that the student replaced his paper with the notes of some Song people from school, but only with a brief foreword. Mak Qing told him that it could not be written into the comment, otherwise it would delay the student's future. He took the advice of Mak Ching. He is not just responsible for his students, but also deeply in love. \\nLiu Baishan (1909-1965), died earlier and may not be familiar to everyone. He was originally known as the word casting, the word casting, the sound of the sound, Jiangsu Jingjiang people. Graduated from the sixth high school in Jiangsu Province in 1929, admitted to the Department of Chinese, Zhejiang University, and dropped out of school due to illness. He and Jun are old friends, mobilized by Jun old, came to Shanghai in November 1957 to work, has served as editor of Shanghai Classical Literature Publishing House, editorial editor and deputy director of editorial office of China. In 1962, China created an academic publication 'On Chinese History Series', under the responsibility of Liu Baishan. Qianbocheng said Liu 'is the first editor in fact, but not signed'. Liu's masterpiece, 'Li Bai Two Into Changan,' was published in the second series of Chinese History Series. Liu Baishan's two brothers Liu Shuzhou and Jiang Tianzuo are both old revolutionary and old cadres, and are more well-known than him. \\nLiu Shuzhou (1911-1985), joined the Communist Party of China in 1931. He was the president of Shanghai Jiaotong University after his founding. Jiang Tianzuo (1913-1987), joined the Communist Party of China in 1930 and the Left Union in 1932. After the founding of the country, he served as deputy president of the People's Literary Publishing House and vice chairman of the Jiangxi branch of China Zoitao Author of the commentaries 'Jiang Tianzuo Collection', translated by British writer Dickens's Pickewick Gaiden, Orevell, American writer Jack London's novel 'Call of the Wilderness', 'Snow Tiger,' and the Russian writer Saktikov Schedrin's Allegory of Saktikov Schedrin, etc. \\nYu Zaichun (1909-1993), Zhenjiang People, Jiangsu. Born in the Book Fragrant Gate. In 1924, he was admitted to St. John's University, a famous church school in Shanghai, and then went to the Department of Literature of Shanghai Guanghua University. He published his debut in Modern Review. After 1949, he was an associate professor in the Department of Chinese at Nanjing University. In March 1955, he was redeployed to Shanghai New Literary Publishing House as editor at the request of Li Junmin. In June 1958, China was established. He is the head of the selected research work group (the second editorial group), (deputy leader Jin Xingyao). In addition to Jin Xingyao, his subordinates at that time were also writer Meilin (1908-1986), writer Shi Ying and He Manzi, who was the head of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Cultural Association, who was implicated in the 'Hu Feng case'. The second editorial group is mainly engaged in the popularization of classical literature. The editorial and published books are mainly 'Classical Literature Popular Books' series, 'Chinese Live Leaf Literature' and so on. Jin Xingyao called 'Yu Gong' in the spring, saying that this is called 'also contains the ridicule meaning of 'tortuous gong'', because he said: 'All I insist, will prove to be correct in the end.' Jin Xingyao believes: 'He has a place where he is stubborn and debilitating.' \\nIn addition to these four editors, the ancient editors are Qu Diyuan, He Manzi, Wang Mian, Zhou Shao, and so on, are also very famous. \\nGao Keqin: In addition to the 'troika' and 'four editors', there are some elderly people, such as Hu Daojing, Jin Xingyao, Zhou Lengga and so on. Zhou is also a strange man, he is deaf ears, but writing things very fast, in the 340s of last century is a famous novelist in Shanghai. In the classical literature publishing house a lot of classical novels, in the 1990s, also wrote a lot of popular books for the ancient book publishing house, such as 'Manga Golden Plum', 'Manga Gods' etc. \\nAnd Wang Mian. He was born in 1916 in Changle, Fujian, a book fragrant family. He entered the Department of Sociology of Tsinghua University in the 30s of last century, from Wu Jingchao, Pan Guangdan and other famous teachers, and many of today's celebrities and academics are students. After the seven seven incidents, the school moved south to Yunnan. After graduation, he worked in Kunming and served as an American interpreter for the Kuomintang Expeditionary Force. He was beaten to the right in 1957 and was reformed by labor for the so-called historical issue of having worked as an American interpreter. I heard him that at that time it was a person in the community who took him to the Tiger Bridge prison with a yellow fish car. He really wanted to jump over the Waibaidu Bridge, but when he thought that there were two daughters at home, he endured. Wang used to love smoking. After detention, there was no money to smoke, always picking up people's cigarette butts. After crushing the Gang of Four, he quit smoking. He was 60 years old. He returned to Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House for another 10 years of editorial work. The editor published many scholarly valuable classical literature research works, and was responsible for editing the Red House Dream Research Collection by Shanghai Red House Dream Society. During this period, he also wrote and published papers on 'Dream of the Red House' and the study of poetry and novels of Ming Qing Qing. He published a monograph 'Wu Weiye', the first monograph after the founding of the country to comprehensively study the life of the early poet Wu Weiye and his literary achievements. After retirement, Mr. Wang Mian was able to have more energy in reading and writing, and published a series of books and nostalgic texts in the name of Kunxi. He tried to make up for the time he had been denied, and his wish to his friends in the hospital bed was 'I have to write'. Mr. Wang was very high, and in 2014 'double eleven' died at an old age of 98. \\nMr. Ho Manzi also has a legendary experience and a unique personality. He was born in 1919 in Longmen Town, Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, a family, formerly known as Sun Chengxun, the Sun family recognized himself as a descendant of the Three Kingdoms Sun Quan, but he went to the world under the pseudo name of 'He Manzi', even the junior also followed his name He. He was a university professor and was editor in chief of the newspaper. He went to Yan'an during his youth, and later left Yan'an, and since then drift north and south. After the founding of the country, he was first beaten as a 'Hu Feng' and jailed for more than a year. After he came out, he was beaten as right-wing elements for 20 years and spent 20 years of nightmare years and sent to a labor reform farm in Ningxia, almost died. At that time, one of the leaders of Shanghai's culture and education, called Shi Ximin, was also love talent, and moved him back to Shanghai. Until the end of the Cultural Revolution, he returned to Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House, re-engaged in editing the old business, and returned to the golden age of his research and writings. He was named eight contemporary essays. Originally his ambition is to govern, have a sense of Jun old personality charm, has been in the ancient editorial. He has more than 20 kinds of essay collection 'Draw Tiger Ten Years', 'Green Scream', 'Cordyceps Collection' He admired Lu Xun, his life to Mr. Lu Xun as a model, treatment as the text is so, not tending, not kitsch, sincere friends and evil, always pay attention to the reality, to see the phenomenon, often 'bone in the throat, do not spit unpleasant' feeling, the text often has a sense of fiery. died on 8 May 2009 at ninety-old age. \\nThere is also the most famous special editor Qu Diyuan. Qu Duizhi (1894-1973), the name Xuan Ying, the word is, the late yard, Changsha, Hunan people, is modern literature and history everyone, calligrapher. He was born to a family, a deep family. His father Qu Hongqu (1850-1918), is the Qing Military Aircraft Minister, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Shang Book. His mother-in-law is Tsang Jifen, daughter of Tsang He learned from the famous modern literary Wang Yun, and then studied English at the Beijing Translation Institute. He studied French, German, Russian and other languages. He also received modern modern education at St. John University in Shanghai and Fudan University, laying a deep foundation for Chinese studies and Western studies. During the war of resistance, he stayed in Beijing and held a pseudo-post, and then renamed Qu Yikai, which became one of his life's stain and later guilty reasons. \\nAfter the war of resistance, he took the yard, intended to repent, to say goodbye to the old me as a cicada He also taught as a professor at Nankai University, Yanjing University and Furen University. After 1949, the apartment lived in Shanghai, with writings as an industry. After being hired by China as an official editor, this work is said to be the arrangement introduced by Qi Yanming, then head of the Ancient Book Finishing and Publishing Planning Group of the Scientific Planning Committee of the State Council (in addition to a famous literary and historical person Tan Zhengbi was also hired as an official editor). To become an official editor of China, Qu Yu Yuan has the opportunity to become Chinese classical literature books, especially Tang Dynasty literature books collation research everyone. Prior to that, although he had written and so on, there were few pieces of ancient books in order to organize. China was focused on the collation of classical literature books at that time, with special emphasis on new school notes. The leaders of the Chinese editorial know the history of Mr. Qu Broadcom, have studied the two 'Tang Books', 'General Study of Grants', and successive officials, so let him undertake the work of the two books of Li Bai Ju and Liu Yuxi. His 'Li Bai Set' school note is on the basis of the former finishing of the examination and revision of a lot of fallacy. And his 'Liu Yuxi Set' is unabated and invented. The two works are extremely high. Chen Shangjun, a professor at Fudan University, said that the current researcher's interpretation of Liu Yuxi's commentary does not reach the height of Mr. Qu. Unfortunately, neither of these works was published before Mr. Qu. Becoming an official editor of China's editorial, also caused Qu Yu Yuan to be implicated in the 'Cultural Revolution' and unfortunately fell into the abyss. He was caught up in the 'Six Person Counterrevolutionary Group case' in China, where he was jailed to grievance for the so-called 'mass dissemination of reactionary speech' (see 'Special Editor of Qu Diyuan', published in the Oriental Morning Post Shanghai Book Review on 21 February 2016). \\nIn addition, there is also a special editor is also very famous, is Zhou Lian (1916-2003), famous Shao, Zhejiang Zhenhai people. He was a son of the family, and the teenager became famous. In the 1930s, he interacted with a group of modern writers such as Stilling and Mu Shiying, and compiled a number of magazines, was also one of the essays who worship Lu Xun. After the fall of Shanghai, it became a falling hydrologist. He had de"

In 1941, Dai Wangshu and Mu Lijuan divorced due to differences in character. Mu returned to Shanghai, after having interacted with Zhou Duo, and eventually married. After liberation, Zhou Shao entered the Shanghai Literary and Art Publishing House and was reformed by labor for many years because of historical problems. After crushing the 'Gang of Four', return to Shanghai. Because familiar with history, but also familiar with Jin Xingyao, he was introduced to Junlao, so he was invited to work in the elders for nearly 20 years, such as the collection of Chachuan line ('dedicated hall poetry collection'), was his finishing. He has a good relationship with people in old age and stole. \\nSo, in the ancient eighties of the last century, there was a group of old literary people, old editors from the 1930s. Three of them in the same year: Jin Xingyao, Wang Mian, Zhou Shao. They are similar to their age are Manzi, Chen Zhenpeng, Qian bocheng, Zhu Jincheng, Fu Shousun and so on. There are old editors of rich strength, college students in the 1950s, Wei Tongxian, Wang Xiandu, Li Guozhang and so on. Then there are graduates from 1980's: Zhao Changping, Li Weiguo, Li Mengsheng, Wang Zhenyuan, Jin Liangnian, Wang Xingkang, etc. It is also this time for me to be in ancient work, and it has been 30 years now. We can proudly say that ancient talents are not inferior to national universities. At that time, from the study of literature and history, universities, social sciences, and publishing houses were tripleted. \\nThere are also many old editors 'Cultural Revolution' before entering the ancient, right? \\nGao Keqin: After the 'Cultural Revolution', the ancient one hand tried to get back the old editors who were demobilized in the 'Cultural Revolution', in addition to the above mentioned Ho Manzi, Wang Mian, and Chen Bangyan, Shen Shen and so on. Chen Bangyan, Zi Yunzhi, born in Hangzhou in 1920, native of Hubei Xishui. Gao Zu Chen hang is a famous poet and poetry critic in the Qing Dynasty. His father Chen Zengshou is a famous poet in modern times, and has works such as 'Qiu Poetry Collection'. After his founding, Mr. Bang Yan joined the China Council for the Promotion of Democracy and worked in the organs of the Shanghai Association for the Promotion of Democracy. 1957 was beaten as the right. Work in dry schools during the Cultural Revolution. 1978 entered Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House, as director of the second editorial room. He began his career as a professional editor for nearly sixteen years until he retired in the old years. \\nShen Shanjun is a senior horticulturist at the Shanghai Garden Bureau. He graduated from Zhejiang Agricultural College. He has a family origin, his father and Zou Taofen are classmates. After the end of the 'Cultural Revolution', he made editors. On the other hand, the ancient public recruitment of editors to the community, these editors have become the backbone of the business of Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House for quite a period. Hundreds of people were enrolled at that time, and finally enrolled 11, and after long work, became experts in related fields. For example, Mr. Deng Changfeng is an expert in Ming Qing drama history, Mr. Cao Minggang is a faculty expert, and Mr. Li Zuotang has a very research on the four library versioning. \\nSince 1978, nearly 40 years, it is also counted as talent generation. Ancient not only cultivated many publishing talents, but also many cadres were transferred to other publishing houses in the industry as leaders, such as Li Weiguo, who served as editor-in-chief of Shanghai People's Publishing House, Wang Xingkang as president of Shanghai People's Publishing House, Li Mengsheng, president of Chinese Dictionary Publishing House, as Shanghai bookstore publishing house Li Weiguo, Zhang Xiaomin, and Qin Zhihua, three presidents of Shanghai Speech Publishing House in recent years Editorial career was also started in ancient times, so the ancient was once hailed as the 'Huangpu Military Academy' in Shanghai publishing world. \\nHow did these expert editors from Shanghai Ancient Book Publishing House help? \\nGao Keqin: the ancient 60 years, leadership is expert leadership, editor is more expert editor. In the 1950s there were four editors and Mr. Hu Daojing, Jin Xingyao and others. Mr. Hu, a well-known science and technology historian and ancient documentator, has had a great influence on the study of the Song Dynasty Shen Gom and his 'Dream Creek Pen Talk', Xu Guangqi and his 'Full Book of Agriculture' and so on. Prestigious, he was elected as a Communication Member of the International Academy of Scientific History. Mr. Hu has a family origin. His father, Mr. Huai Chen and his uncle, Mr. Park An, are members of the Southern Society and have a great deal with Mr. Liu Yazi. Mr. Hu studied Chinese Liberal Arts Department at the University. He studied versioning, bibliography, and finishing and photocopying of ancient books from a version catalogist Mr. Chen Nai-kyan. In the Cultural Revolution, China was merged into the Shanghai People's Publishing House, and Mr. Hu was also persecuted. In 1978, Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House was established independently, Mr. Hu did not come back and worked at the Shanghai People's Publishing House until his retirement. \\nJinxingyao and Ho Manzi of the Ancient Society are scholars who can be among the first-class scholars. There are also Mr. Chen Zhenpeng, Mr. Li Xueying and others who have made a great contribution to the editorial post. For the younger generation, Li Weiguo, mentioned above, is distinguished in the study of Song Shi and Dunhuang, vice president of the Shanghai Historical Society. Zhao Changping is also a leading figure in the study of Tang Poetry and vice president of the Tang Dynasty Literature Society of China; Li Mengsheng is excellent in classical novels and generational literature research. Vice President of the Chinese Yuan Literature Society. \\nSixty years, published a large number of works by the most influential first-class masters in China, which shows that the ancient predecessors have an academic vision on the one hand, and on the other hand are people. For example, Mr. Chen Yinke's book book office went to Mr. Chen through the Propaganda Department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Yang Rongguo, head of the History Department of Sun Yat-sen University, and was rejected by Mr. Chen. The ancient times are through Mr. Chen's students. Chen Shoushi and Jiang Tianshu from Fudan University are in contact with Mr. Chen. In the course of six years of writing, the ancient times have been very respectful of Mr. Chen. Not only have he exchanged letters with Mr. Chen, the main leaders Chen Xiangping and Qi Mingqu visited Mr. Chen on a special trip to Guangzhou; but also through Mr. Chen's disciples to understand Mr. Chen's body and writings, send timely greetings to win. Got the trust of Mr. Chen. It can also be added here that after Mr. Chen arrived in Guangzhou, he lives in a Recreation Park. He lives upstairs is Sun Yat-sen University professor Wang Jisi. Professor Wang Xiangping has a good relationship with Chen Xiangping. He contacted Mr. Chen through Professor Wang and made an appointment. Finally, he received Mr. Chen Yinke's book, and after the end of the 'Cultural Revolution' 'Chen Yin Ke's Book' was published, making a historical contribution to contemporary Chinese culture and publishing. \\n23 October 2016\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 18"

The headquarters is based in the Soviet Union, implicating all the black five children of the Linxi Brigade. Even the neighboring brigades who can know their names are rich and bad right children, all the anti-revolutionary teams who can know their names. In the go. \\nThe wind that killed five categories of black in Hunan Province, like a plague, quickly spread to the surrounding counties, and the slaughter was carried out in various places, and the wind also passed to the Linxi Brigade of Fangyuan Commune in Guiyang County. \\nThis year, he Yuqing, head of the morious brigade militia battalion and deputy secretary of the brigade, was held in power. He always believed that his family had divided the house left by my great-grandfather. I don't know what day, we will fight back and take an opportunity to retaliate. One day without removing our brothers, one day is uncomfortable. He has repeatedly asked the team comrade and party branch secretary Jiang Chuanqu to say: 'Kill them, kill them, kill them, and we will be assured. \\nIn July this year, after a day of research and discussion, he Yuqing and Jiang Chuanpin decided to collectively kill the whole family of the five kinds of people in the whole brigade, and immediately called several rebel leaders and militia cadres to hold a secret meeting to read out the People's Daily editorial, 'Sweeping All the Ghosts and Snakes'. Reports of the killings in the county. \\nThey said, 'Brother counties have all acted, and we must not be behind.' He Yuqing said: 'There is a class struggle. Only by killing all the rich and bad right and its children, there will be no class struggle.' The meeting decided: in the early morning of the next day, in the name of holding a meeting of the rich and bad of their and their children, they would be assembled in a house at the team site. The militia and poor farmers representatives were guarded outside. Then, on the grounds of personal talk, they shouted out the office one by one, and tied them up in half the way. Come and take them to an empty room 200 meters away, and they were killed by the representatives of four powerful poor farmers. The elderly, children and women were killed in the last place. The meeting also drafted a notice of the Supreme Interim Court of Peasants and elected 12 persons for the execution of the death penalty. \\nThe announcement content is:\\n[The highest instruction] sweep all cattle ghosts snake God, where reactionary things, you do not hit it will not fall, like sweeping the ground, brooms are not, dust will not run away. \\nIn order to make the country not change its color, avoid revisionism and capitalism, to avoid the return of revisionism and capitalism, and to avoid all reactionaries in combination with all reactionaries, so that the vast majority of poor farmers have a safe living environment, eliminate worries, rest their hearts to build socialism, and learn from brotherly counties and counties, By all the cadres of the Linxi brigade, poor farmers unanimously passed, decided to be rich against the ground against the right The death penalty is carried out in all its families, young and old. This announcement is hereby. The payment is: poor rural revolution committee and poor farmers Supreme Court President: Jiang Chuanqian, He Yuqing. \\nLater this night, the militia secretly told me the news that I wanted to flee the night and could not escape the next day, and repeatedly stressed the need to keep the secret, not to say he told it. After the news of the mother, he said to me, 'Son, you and your brother are still young, run away. I and your big brother are old, especially I, have been a year of the wind candles, and people have to die, and the chief secretary has to die, let them do it! \\nThat night, I also informed Qiu daojie Daojie, the right wing of the village, that the three of us arrived in Guiyang County late at night from a small road on the hill through a place under the jurisdiction of Datang Commune. In order not to expose the target, the three of us broke up in the county. After breaking up, I came to my sister Liu Peitao family hiding for more than a dozen days. Every day, especially at night, one after a nightmare haunting me. \\nMy heart thought: hiding in the outside East, there is always no way, all the world is a rebellion guard, the whole society is covered with dark clouds of class hatred. Anywhere is the same, to avoid the first 15, escape is not escaped. More than a dozen days later, I took the initiative to surrender to the Guiyang County Military Commission. \\nAt the Military Control Council, I explained the reasons for the flight and asked for refuge. The chief listened to me and placed me in the military subdivision. They reported to their superiors. Soon one chief said to me that there were acts of killing rich land in a few parts of the country, but they were all anarchist acts and were wrong. At present, we have not received any documents from the Party Central Committee concerning the right of the Party Central Committee on the right of rich and bad. He went on to say, 'Tomorrow, we send you back to the commune, and we will convey to them that opinion. \\nAfter having had breakfast the next day, the two chiefs sent me to the Fang Yuan Commune Revolutionary Committee. After the military division chief exchanged views with local commune cadres, the Commune Reform Commission sent me back to the Linxi Brigade and conveyed to them the spirit of the superior. \\nAfter returning home, I was working and living under the supervision of the militia and red guards. As my brother and my brother and Jiang Kai-cheng family fled overnight, forcing the Linxi Brigade to slaughter the rich. After that, my brother Qiu daojie Shibao heard that I had returned home, the brigade canceled the murder plan, and ended his escape to return home. Although our flight, temporarily escaped a robbery, but the dark clouds still shrouded over the Linxi brigade, there is the possibility of being killed at any time, anywhere, my hanging heart can not come down. \\nBesides, Qiu daojie Daojie broke up with me since Guiyang broke up, he had no way to go. He heard that at that time Xinjiang farms were recruiting migrant workers. He thought that there should be no fierce class struggle in the mainland. At the same time, he was also heard that a landlord born in the vicinity of Shuitou Village also settled there. An instinctive desire to survive forced him to try it. So he took a train to Xinjiang. On the way, Red Guards in the car one after another to check the certificate and check the introduction letter, Qiu daojie Daojie was repatriated by the Red Guiyang County Fangyuan Commune Revolutionary Committee because he was not certified, and then sent him to the Linxi brigade by the commune militia. \\nHe Yuqing, director of the militia battalion, had a great pleasure after hearing the letter. He thought that the murder plan he believed was the flight of Qiu daojie Daojie and others and declared a failure. Today, he was sent back to the brigade by the government, and will surely be subject to rigorous trial on conviction of the country The brigade set up an ad hoc trial team. He was the leader of Jiang Chuanpin as deputy leader, and conducted overnight raids interrogation of Qiu daojie Daojie. \\nHe Yuqing made full preparation and careful arrangements for all interrogations. He asked: What are you doing in Xinjiang? Are you planning to transit from Xinjiang to the Soviet Union to rely on revisionism? Do you want to set up an anti-Republican Salvation Army abroad? \\nQiu daojie Daojie said, 'You want to kill me, I want to escape to Xinjiang farm to do hard work. \\n'You cunning, you are not honest, only a dead end, on the light hook hung him up, see he does not trick.' He Yuqing bites his teeth and said. \\nUnder the ravages of sticks and various ancient instruments, Qiu daojie Daojie was beaten to the meat ingot, died to live, cries, screams, moans every day. Through more than ten days of torture and interrogation, Qiu daojie Daojie finally admitted to participating in the anti-Republican Salvation Army according to what he Yuqing said. The headquarters is based in the Soviet Union, implicated all the children of the Linxi Brigade Black five categories, even the neighboring Maori Brigade, the Shuri Brigade, the Changfin Brigade and the surrounding brigade can know the name. The rich and bad right children of the word have been implicated in the anti-revolutionary ranks. Then, in the brigades, the climax of the rich and bad right children in the area of arrest and interrogation. The children of the neighboring brigade were forced under severe torture to force confessions, and also involved the children of the Black Five molecule around them. It was really a circle, the bigger the circle, less than a dozen days, the whole commune or even the commune was rich against the right. Women became counter-revolutionary. \\nImmediately after questioning, what were their counter-revolutionary plans? What is the Programme of Action? What is the Anti-Revolution Charter? Nor is it right for one to come to trial. As the saying goes, 'People's heart is like iron and iron, official law is really like furnace', under heavy punishment, whatever you say, you have to admit that for a time the sound of the sky, the evil soul is wild. \\nAfter a long torment, in September 1968, Qiu daojie Daojie died under the sticks of Ho Yuk Ching and others, when he was five years old, leaving his wife and three minor daughters. His wife, Li Chang-in-law, heard the sad news of her husband's death, cried and died to live. He Yuqing sent a group of Red Guards to her home, not allowed to cry, not to abuse, and not to have undue rumors to insinuate cadres. Once discovered, he was found to be severely punished for the recalcitrant crime of counter-revolutionary family resistance. Thus, the husband was killed without reason and the wife was denied even the right to cry."

I insisted on looking for leadership cadres on the rehabilitation affairs, and as a result I came to a young man with a new official to take office. Three or five questions should be answered, immediately promised to write down the name, and start a review. I guess that the old woman was an activist in the fight against the 'right and counter-revolutionary' that year, so it could be an official for decades. How can her heart continue to preserve the sense of credit of the revolution? And this young cadre has no resentment with those who have been wronged. As long as he hung up on the reasons mentioned above, more than one wrong case, is one more merit in his work today in 'making chaos anyway', why not do it? The counter-notification came down. Even the testimony of a clandestine party cadre rescued by Louis during his radio service was also found. At that time, Louis had heard his parents at home about the name of the underground party student of Chongqing University. Suddenly he received a secret message in the authorities saying that he found that he was a Communist Party and had to be arrested immediately. Louis translated the telegram and immediately went straight to the student's place of residence and asked him to leave quickly. Thirty years later, his proof came. Whenever I think of this matter, I often can't help but scold this old revolutionary cadre. When Louis was not trusted by the unit, then when the university was not admitted to Louis, when Louis was arrested and sentenced, why didn't you stand up to prove him once? Now he's dead! He is your salvation! However, I thought that the movement was still harsh, and when Louis was put up, maybe this underground party cadre was also suspected of being a traitor or accused of having right-wing rhetoric?"

				"memoirContent": "【Attached】Peng Xiaoming: 'Seven Rightists in My Relatives' (Independent Chinese PEN 'Peng Xiaoming Collection' 2007)\\nIt has been 50 years since the fight against the right. To count, there are seven of my relatives on the right. \\nBig Brother\\nSaid that the right first said my father, he was not the right, originally one of the founders of Shanghai Children's Publishing House. The publication history of the official office will not mention his name, but history should remember the real situation. He was suddenly arrested as a suspect in the Panhan counter-revolutionary group case in 1955, and later sentenced to 10 years for counter-revolutionary charges, starved to death in Tipan Bridge prison in three years of famine and 28 years later. The impression left in my mind was that I was woken up by a noisy voice in the middle of the night, and saw a full house of police flipping the crate and the paper was mess, and my mother told me that my father was arrested by the police. I looked at the banner 'People Translator' won by my father on the wall. However, during the anti-right period, his case remained unadjudicated. \\nMy big brother Qiuhuai has heard Mao Zedong's sworn lies and is determined to participate in the party's winds as members move closer to the party's organization. Brother is a man who loves music and poetry. In the middle school era, a wall was posted in the school, criticizing the KMT's current politics. At that time, he did not necessarily understand what politics was, but the social culture was so that traces of freedom of speech during the Kuomintang rule did exist. \\nThe PLA is stationed in Shanghai. The Shanghai Melon Middle School, where he studied, is a French church school. Many of the teachers and students have the cadres of the underground Communist Party, and the Kuomintang soldiers are defeated. These teachers and students reveal the truth and propagate the Communist Party policy. In the summer of 1949, the People's Republic of China was not yet established, and the big brother had a note in the translation that his father had told him to transcribe: Dad, Mom: I took part in the revolution. Don't come to the team to chase me. Also changed the name of Qiuhuai. At that time he was just 16 years old. After joining the military, he went to Fujian with the PLA southward service group, and later stationed in the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian. He was both a cultural instructor of the army and an actor of the fighter's performance team. Eight years later, Big Brother returned to Shanghai. Just came to Shanghai Yuptang Primary School as a music teacher. \\nThe anti-right movement began. He was not on the first round of anti-right round. Later, when the whole breath classes were not enough, it happened that the elder brother's remarks included content related to rebellion. Brother said: 'My father was arrested in rebellion. I am a member of the Communist Youth League. If he is really a counter-revolution, I certainly have to stand firm and firmly draw the line with him; but if he is innocent, it should be released. Such detention for nearly three years without sentencing is incompatible with the spirit of the law of the Party.' All those involved in the fight against the right (other parties and political leaders, general purchase and sales, Sino-Soviet friendship, text reform, etc.), are designated as the right. Brother fleeing. He was under 25 years old and a beautiful girlfriend was in love. The right is crowned, everything has changed. Expulsion of the group, not allowed to teach, clean the toilet. Girlfriend also blew up. One year I returned to Shanghai, and my brother had revealed to me his grief. His school was not far away from the Railway Palace of Culture, where some old films were regularly screened. Without family, no friends, he sometimes goes there alone to watch a night movie that can temporarily forget his sins. \\nThe film of that day was Shakespeare's Othello. Beautiful Tastemona was mistrust by black general Othello, she was faithful, not rewarded for love, even strangled by generals anger. Not strange plot at this moment suddenly raised the big brother's heart of traumatic pain. Clearly, it is a kind of genuine affair to the party, and turned out to be beaten as the right party. He could not help but sadly, returned to the dormitory and cried for the night. Who is willing to listen to this mood except to speak to his brother? After picking the hat, it is still the right party. Fortunately, the female principals repeatedly reported to their superiors that the big brother 'made mistakes' had worked actively and obeyed the leadership. He was not dismissed from public office and re-education through labour through labour. \\nDuring the Cultural Revolution period, he entered the cattle shed and went down to the school, and until 1979 'corrected', he was almost fifty years old, before he became the director of teaching. Because 'participation in the revolution' was earlier than the National Day of 1949, he was granted leave, of course, much lower than those who did not experience the right, because those people were already cadres at the county corps, prefectures or even provincial ministries. \\nAfter my father was rehabilitated, my brother and sister were all the business backbone of the unit, all being absorbed into the party. First Brother joined the NLD and later applied for membership. I smiled to him that the communists in history had a lot of remarkable figures. But what is the Communist Party today? He said, 'You don't understand, this is a pursuit I started with youth. How do I not understand. My middle school right-wing Russian teacher speaks exactly the same thing as you. I have written an application for the regiment myself and have never been approved. But by the difference, I can't forget that this party is a predetermined, tempting 'masculine' party. I'm a man. Never do the kind of foolish woman who was seduced, half-life enduring humiliation, when the evil man was completely lost and prestige swept the ground. I repeat what I said to my sister when joining the party: 'I'm a little excited for you to join the party. Not to congratulate you on joining an advanced party, but I know you are an honest person, you can join this party, you can make the sludge in it a little bit of innocence. Integrity, if you can also promote a little reform and innovation, it is even more delighted.' Now the big brother is old dragon bell, saying he still loves to sing and writing poems. He took part in the re-performance of the old opera 'Sister Jiang'. I sniffed. What is that garbage! Illustrated work in 1964 in cooperation with class struggle propaganda. A wanton distortion of historical clandestine struggles, the so-called class struggles are intended solely to use family origin and social relations to provoke people and adolescents to mistrust and monitor each other. \\nTwo aunts couple\\nMy two aunts and wife Mu Mutian and Peng Huidu are professors at Beijing Normal University. 1957 doubles into the right. Professor Mu studied in Japan during his youth, is the first symbolic poet in China and one of the seven founders of the Founding Society. 'Travel Heart' is the singing of the symbolism of modern Chinese poetry in the 1930s. He is evil as vengeance, blatantly, love and hatred. Under the KMT rule, he certainly does not see one-party authoritarian politics, limited press freedom. So he leaned left, approached the underground party, met Lu Xun. Unfortunately, he was arrested by the KMT. When he was released from prison, he was suspected by Lu Xun and suspected that he betrayed the revolution. Shortly after Lu Xun died, it became a pending case under Lu Xun's pen. He did not change his original intention and continued to be inclined to the revolution and criticize KMT people After 1949, from Shanghai to Northeastern Normal University and then to Beijing Normal University, he found that the new society was not the one he sought to speak freely, criticize and self-criticize. The CPC committee actually had a place to hide dirt. \\nIn 1957 Mao Zedong's trap opened a lasso, calling on intellectuals to help the Party rectify the wind Professor Mu, who is cynical, is worried, but he believes Mao Zedong. He writes that the news does not abstain, the speaker is guilty, 'not a doctor, no courtesy', is the tradition of the University for several years. This movement, of course, I also have a lot of concerns, but, I believe that the party, believe Chairman Mao, finally took the courage to speak... (after stating that his criticism was returned by the Party Committee)... I would not speak, let alone, I had to quit the venue until today, I had no courage to participate in these again. Will be. The facts are all about, and as the head of leading the wind, still dare to argue, the future of the movement of the University cannot but be worrisome. (Finally he called)... save the salvation! Let the dark kingdom have a ray of light! (Muktien, My Appeal, 1957.5.22, Guangming Daily)\\nHe dare to accuse Beijing Normal University under the leadership of the Party as a dark kingdom? Moreover, the direct attack on the leadership of the Party Committee is 'not to learn nothing, and the whole person has surgery.' In addition, he was a bourgeois Impressionist poet in his early years, and was suspected by Mr. Lu Xun as a defect of the revolution, how can not be reduced to the right! A poet and scholar who is fluent in Japanese, French and Russian, ceased to teach and work, went to the construction site to knock stones and wrote materials for the school on weekdays. After the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution, wages were withheld again, housing was tightened, the nanny was removed, and his wife died suddenly after the fighting meeting. He does not cook, buying a few burns a day (a kind of burned cake in Beijing), for the day. \\n1970 Normal University conveyed room workers accidentally remembered the old man did not buy fire for many days, pry door inspection, found that it had long returned to the west days, so I do not know which day is his taboo day. He once joined the Left Union, hated the KMT, hated Japanese fascism, propelled for the revolution, yearning for the Soviet Union, pursuing the Communist Party. But the real new society, the real Communist Party, is by no means his ideal social and ideal party. Professor Mu, who used to swim in the dream of French impressions poetry, once travelled in Wilde's fairy tale world, did not think that the ideal society he pursued, the community led by the Communist Party was such a dark kingdom. Under the fierce blow against the right, he reviewed, he did not yield in the face of the Kuomintang, he was not timid in the face of Japanese fascism, and he dared to quit the venue at the beginning of the whole wind. However, widespread criticism in academia, the Guangming Daily named the name of abusive ('The Owl of the Dark Kingdom'), made him dizzy and confused. Before the Cultural Revolution, he had taken his hat, but his status was still very low, and the Cultural Revolution began, and he became the object of criticism and abuse. When I went to Beijing in 1967, I lived at his home and felt he was reactive and had no depression. But at the last moment of his life, his wife was criticized to death, son was beaten as a counter-revolutionary in Shanghai to Gansu labour and died, her daughter underwent school to draw the boundaries with herself, Qiong Qiongli, when the tea pot was difficult, did he think that he had ever pursued pure poetry pure Poetry in the past? Do you think that he is clearly a leftist intellectuals, how can they become hat-picking right-wing elements? Do you think that in the northeast under the rule of the day, poets can write a little symbolic poetry and express their emotions concealed. In Guilin, Chongqing and Shanghai under the rule of the Kuomintang, he can also write articles against social reality. In 1948, he took part in Tongji University, with his monthly pay pocket with a pocket of money. Tickets, but can not buy a few kilograms. In his poem 'I seem to be in a ghost world,' he wrote about the difficulties of life caused by the KMT's spamming of banknotes and inflation:\\nThe tickets to pay for meals are piled up,\\nHigher than a plate of fried rice. \\nI think it seems to have a ticket stuffed in my stomach. \\nThe result is still hungry. \\nTo his own pursuit of the Communist Party society, he turned out to become a traitor and reactionary academic authority. Don't say to publish poetry, he simply lost his right to speak, and the late scene was bleak and even a loved one could not see? \\nMy second aunt Peng Hui was a student of Lu Xun. On the day of the 318 tragedy at Beijing Women's Normal University, the blood of Liu Hezhen and other deceased students soaked in her cotton robe. She studied the theory of revolutionary at Sun Yisen Oriental Workers' University in Moscow. She was both a literary youth of the left and a brave woman of the underground party. Her comrades were killed in the windy waves of the Great Revolution, and her youth were written in revolutionary stories. She was also a leftist woman writer in Guilin, Chongqing and Kunming during the civil war between the two parties. She firmly stood on the side of the Communist Party. As a professor of progress, women's movement activist and female writer, her speeches and articles attracted the attention and respect of many young women in the Union-Region to the Communist Party. She translated many works such as Old Russian-era Mountain Man Loving Freedom, and the Diary of Leningrad from the Soviet era. She and Professor Mu ushered in a 'new state of socialism' in Shanghai. First to Mu Mutian's hometown of Northeast Normal University, and then returned to his alma mater Beijing Normal University. Describing the literature of Marxism and participating in red studies, she became one of the very few female party professors in the early years of the founding of the country. It is also this identity, when a few people in the CPC Committee are contaminated with corruption and often drive girls back to dormitories in the middle of the night cause student debate, the female classmates asked Peng Hui to come up and call for a positive atmosphere. She is, of course, duty-bound. So it was opposed to the leadership of the Party Committee. The anti-right situation is just a good opportunity to take their couples away. So both of them were fleeing. After picking the hat, literary criticism in modern China and real-political relations are difficult to understand. It is difficult for the hat-picking right, who was expelled from party membership, to speak again. So she spent a great deal of energy creating the revolutionary memoirs of the long novel, 'The Yangtze River Rolling'. Unfortunately, just unwritten, dream of looking for a publishing house, the Cultural Revolution suddenly broke out, hope dashed. Red guards from Beijing Normal University fought her together. One day, the fight ended, the Red Guards put her into a small room to be held. More than 60 years, two aunts with severe asthma usually often fall asleep due to respite and sleep at night. After such verbal violence and physical violence insults, she is not hard to imagine how traumatized her body and mind. Sickness, grief, loneliness, confusion came together. The next day when the Red Guard, who was holding her, opened the door again, she never wakes up again. At the end of the Cultural Revolution, the fourth Cultural Congress put the names of Mu Mutian and Peng Hui into the list of writers and artists who were persecuted in the Cultural Revolution. The novel 'The Yangtze River Rolling' was finally published. But the author can't see it anymore. What is more pity is that there are many more lively and touching episodes of the novel's original manuscripts, but fear that politics does not fit into the political box at the time of the time, and they have become a joke at the time of publication, but the manuscript has ceased to exist. \\nBig Cousin\\nMouliy, because his father Professor Mumutien specializes in French literature, so the child gave him the name of a French man, Louis. The name has also been 'Lu Xun'. When Louis was a kid, Mom and Dad pushed him to Luxun's home to guest. At dinner, Louis suddenly said that the dish was not delicious! Parents say that children do not mess. Lu Xun tasted that plate of side dishes, found that the child did not say wrong, the dish was really, and could not eat again. Lu Xun's complete collection recorded this little thing. Louis grew up, exactly when the war of resistance broke out, the war of war was desperate. The school was dissolved and the parents had gone first to the big rear. He walked around the streets and found an admissions advertisement, a radio technical school, free of charge for boarding and boarding. His junior high school culture just met the conditions for admission. Then he was admitted to school. What is the expectation that this is a school where the KMT troops train telegram personnel. After completing the course without much effort, he was assigned to the radio station to send and receive passwords. Originally, this skill also had the military significance of the Japanese resistance war, but later the code telegram was a weapon against the Communist Party. When he realized the bad nature of the school, he had no choice, and the confidential unit was not allowed to leave at will. \\nParents are more anxious for this, obviously the son of progress teaching the family, how can they go to the KMT's authoritarian secret service? They worked together, on the one hand, Louie's emotions in the organs. On the one hand, on the one hand, they sought personal relations, bought through their superiors, and finally said that their grandmother was sick and had to return to her homeland to take care of, finally escaped from the authoritarian organ of the KMT and read again. When the PLA arrived in Shanghai, he was a preparatory student of the Biology Department of Tongji University. Tongji University is already a communist world on campus in Jiangwan town, and he often brings communist news back to the city and tells our family. The PLA took over Shanghai, and he joined the Young People's League of New Democrats (the predecessor of the Communist Youth League), maintaining order in the streets every day, sweating and disappearing. His parents encouraged him to take part in the revolution and stop his studies in biology, so he became a staff member of the Shanghai Changning District Committee. Once again, he made the wrong choice, and if he graduated from the Department of Biology and became a scholar, there might be a slightly better end. However, working in a party group organ, and also had experience working in the KMT's secret service agencies. By the 1950s, the idea of class struggle became more and more tighter, he could not wash it out to jump to the Yellow River. \\nHe is considered different in the unit, and his parents also ask him to move closer to the party organization and ask for progress! In 1955, he was arrested in prison for suspicion of his history and later rereleased, considering that her parents were professor of progress. He wanted to leave such party bodies, and his superiors had also advised him to reapply to university. However, university admissions also depend on political history, and the university entrance examination in 1957 was particularly strict. It is impossible for the university to admit him at all. He was bored in his heart and made a little whirl, since young people with a culture were mobilized to enrol in college, and he was not admitted (not on the basis of merit but on political issues). In the anti-right period, this kind of blame is the right-wing rhetoric that is dissatisfied with the party. It happens that both parents and both parents have been hit on the right, from the son of the party member professor to the son of the right, and then look at his historical experience, the right hat is too light, so finally arrested and deported to Gansu labour on charges of counter-revolution. His parents are in Beijing, and he usually comes to our house on weekends. My sister and I were little brother, so he often bought all kinds of new fairy tales. Beautiful stories like Cinderella, Donkey Ear King, Princess Pea, Wizard of Oz and their beautiful pictures are all his gifts. Sentenced to re-education through labour, escorted to The family can see the face once before the line. His parents were not in Shanghai, and my mother went to meet with her sister. Three years of famine already augured,All the way to buy anything,By the way to buy only a bag of pickles。 Send him a meal on the way. When the prisoner's car drove, the prisoner's families cried, and his voice 'Goodbye Three Aunts!' It turns out to be a A few months later, he wrote that the pickles had helped him and several of his companions too much, 'thank you three aunt'. As a result, you can see the hardships of eating all the way. At first, he also asked to send him some pastry food, and the mother tried to send it, and when he received a reply, opened to see 'Dear Three Aunts', the mother could not help but tears. On one occasion, he asked us to send an iron lock that could lock the food temporarily. It is not hard to imagine that he lives with other prisoners, starvation is difficult to tolerate, around like a tiger wolf world. When the famine was most severe, my mother and I were also expelled from Shanghai to decentralize the countryside and received a letter from him, hoping to send him cotton shoes. My mother found his watch from the baggage sent to my house after his arrest, together with the newly-bought cotton shoes. Unexpected, for a long time there was no echo Suddenly the package was returned again. Nearly at the same time a prisoner's death notice was sent. When the package opens to see, the cotton shoes are still new, but the watch is gone. \\nIn 1980, I went to Shanghai Changning District Committee to deal with the Luigi case. Comes out of a fifty old woman frowning and cursing Louis is counter-revolutionary. I insisted on looking for leadership cadres on the rehabilitation affairs, and as a result I came to a young man with a new official to take office. Three or five questions should be answered, immediately promised to write down the name, and start a review. I guess that the old woman was an activist in the fight against the 'right and counter-revolutionary' that year, so it could be an official for decades. How can her heart continue to preserve the sense of credit of the revolution? And this young cadre has no resentment with those who have been wronged. As long as he hung up on the reasons mentioned above, more than one wrong case, is one more merit in his work today in 'making chaos anyway', why not do it? The counter-notification came down. Even the testimony of a clandestine party cadre rescued by Louis during his radio service was also found. At that time, Louis had heard his parents at home about the name of the underground party student of Chongqing University. Suddenly he received a secret message in the authorities saying that he found that he was a Communist Party and had to be arrested immediately. Louis translated the telegram and immediately went straight to the student's place of residence and asked him to leave quickly. Thirty years later, his proof came. Whenever I think of this matter, I often can't help but scold this old revolutionary cadre. When Louis was not trusted by the unit, then when the university was not admitted to Louis, when Louis was arrested and sentenced, why didn't you stand up to prove him once? Now he's dead! He is your salvation! However, I thought that the movement was still harsh, and when Louis was put up, maybe this underground party cadre was also suspected of being a traitor or accused of having right-wing rhetoric? \\nUncle Two\\nMy father's second sister married Cheng Xiangcheng, so he became my uncle. His father was a famous real estate dealer in Wuhan, where apartments were built on several streets in Hankou. He is a typical wealthy little; but not Xue Pan style evil less, but love to read, Hao Xia Shangyi, happy prince's schoolboy. In addition to the love to interact with my father and also fall in love with my father's sisters, he received the most of his support later was Wu Xiuquan, a Communist Party foreign cadre. Wu Xiuquan and Wu Xiuquan and his brother's family were poor and often generously funded by Cheng Xiangcheng. Soon after the founding of the Communist Party, Wu Xiuquan returned to his homeland, and did not forget his teenage friends, and picked him up for a day in a jeep ride in Wuhan. My grandma was worried about his aunt in free love with him. In the future, he was like other sons and brothers, three wives and four concubines, would not be unlucky? So do not want to allow marriage. Unexpectedly the aunt and him have been privately settled for life, so staged a thrilling incident of gold suicidal. After the rescue, Grandma was afraid to say half a word, and it was up to them to decide. As a result, they joined in love until the aunt was ill in 1953. \\nAunt Xiangcheng studied in Japan and studied fine arts. Long engaged in art education. He neither participated in the Communist Party's revolution nor subordinate the power of the Kuomintang, that is, an ordinary person who enjoyed his own pleasure. Love kidding, love to drink, gag name is Cheng maniac. Although it is a secondary school, the Huanggang No. 1 Middle School, which he teaches, is very famous. Continuing to date, the annual college entrance examination rate must be 95%. He was a typical bourgeois son who studied in Japan. In 1955, he was taken into a cell and tasted the hungry iron window in prefectural and prefectural jails. Shortly after his acquittal, he felt he had been imprisoned and ashamed to face the students. He was transferred to other schools to teach, and then transferred to Daye Normal School. \\nAgainst the right in 1957, he came to Shanghai for a holiday, and also talked with my mother about Mu Mutian and Peng Hui being named criticized by the Guangming Daily. Who knows that he returned to the unit still being seized a 'right-wing speech' was collected in the materials by Hubei Education magazine: 'Cheng Xiangcheng of Daye teacher said: 'Achievement is the main, but The problem is also serious'.' This phrase, which seems very common today, is reactionary rhetoric in the anti-right era. He was dismissed from public office and returned to his place of origin. Wuhan was a big city, his mother had passed away, and the property had been privately owned and could not be at his disposal. He has been homeless. Fortunately on the eve of his counterright, he married a local rural widow, and then proposed that it would be better to return to her village, where she shared a house with her ex-husband. So Aunt Xiangcheng devolved to this village. Soon my mother and I were expelled from the city by the Shanghai municipal government, either to Xinjiang (Xinjiang), West (Ning), Lan (state), (which is synonymous with the Great Northwest's hard-cold region in the spoken language of the Shanghai people), or turned out of my family and friends. We were forced to go nowhere to go, we took an old envelope of Xiangcheng's uncle, and fought thousands of miles. \\nIn addition to the right-wing teacher in the middle and college schools, he was the longest right elder I spend time together in the morning and evening. I spent five years in that place, including the horrific three years of the Great Famine, and saw the real picture of how people died of starvation. To be sure, the uncle never had a rebellious heart. Until this step in the field, he still believed that the party and the government had wronged him, and his opinion was not malice. He once said to me, You have also removed grass down the earth. Hoe down force, can planing weeds, but sometimes accidentally hard slightly, the cotton seedlings to planing. I am that cotton seedling!' Where he knew, almost 99.99% of the right were cotton seedlings. The Communist Party bloc led by Mao Zedong does not have the sincerity of its historical commitment to democracy. What they want to build is a one-party authoritarian state, and the people cannot enjoy the right to freedom of expression. And the uncle's words were a monologue in the heart of many right-wing elements at that time, which made me intimate. Although he withstood everything in silence, the authorities still said he was not honest. The big steelmaking frenzy swept up, the leader called him to draw a 'marshal of steel'. His toning paintings, the back image of a steel worker reflects a warm scene of steel splashes, and on the back of workers is a striking figure, which is the 'leap forward' indicator of 10.7 million tons of steel per annum decided by the Party Central Committee. \\nI don't know that the county committee leader looked down and said it was writing the digital on the back of the working class, (a bit like a correctional prisoner?), It is insulting the leadership. Immediately cancel this poster, called Cheng Xiang Cheng Cheng Cheng Shing Station, deeply reflect on his attitude towards working people. Famine struck, old people and children in the village continue to starve to death. The price of 'premium food' on the market is soaring. The drug is not expensive, he bought several bottles of cod liver oil drops from the county pharmacy, dripping a few drops every day in the porridge and side dish. He said it was a little nutrition. Perhaps that is, he and his family survived the famine. After I had hepatitis, I returned to Shanghai to transfer medical care, and never again contacted my uncle. In 1981, I studied at Fudan University, and my uncle's son came to Shanghai from Daye to visit me and my mother. Although the brother was not suave when his father was a teenager, he was very aware of his courtesy. He told us that his father was 'corrected'. The elderly are old and no longer work underground, read books and newspapers every day, years more than 70 years, without disease. \\nAnother cousin\\nMy big aunt, Professor Chutunan, is the translator of Greek Mythology and American poet Whitman's Leaf Collection, and one of the leaders of the China National Union. He was appointed vice-chairman of the National People's Congress in the 1980s. In fact, he has long joined the underground communist party, but for the convenience of the struggle, he has long appeared as a democratic liberal intellectuals. People who read Zhang Yi and 'Past things are not as smoke' know "

				"memoirContent": "that Chutunan was a firm left in the anti-right period. In that period of change, the situation of leftist democrats was also very dangerous. Slightly flashed words, they could suffer from the top of the disaster. His eldest son, Chu Zhuang, did not escape the robbery and was beaten to the right. I have no contact with this cousin, just listening to my mother. He was probably smart and robust as a child, and was elected to the Air Force Junior School (KMT's Air Force Training School), sponsored by Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek and chaired by Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek, at that time. But he still became a young man yearning for the revolution. At the age of 19, he broke through the blockade line and went to the liberated zone from Beiping to enter the revolutionary camp. \\nAfter the founding of the Communist Party, he was not only the son of party leaders in the NLD organization, but also a youth cadre of liberation cards. But he accepted the task given to him by his father, which was agreed to by the communist organization, that the democratic party could continue to develop in the era of socialism. So Chu Zhuang introduced members of intellectuals in Hebei to join democratic parties and expand the organization. The movement is coming, and the Democratic Party is the base base for right-wing elements. Chu Zhuang once developed an organization in the local area, and was identified as an anti-party act of 'competing with the party for the masses.' Heaven and earth conscience, how could Chu Zhuang go to develop an organization without the instructions of the party (through the NLD leader, his own father)? However, Mao Zedong is a person who goes out of the way. Clearly said that it was for the party to rectify, and the speakers were not guilty. As a result, all of the right parties were convicted with Mao Zedong himself said that 'professors may make sense', but all those who mentioned 'professors to manage schools' when combating the right are divided into the right. Later before the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong also encouraged Wu Han to write Hairui. 'Hairui Strike' wrote it out, but said that Wu Han was a shadly insinuation for Peng Dehuai, and cursed Wu Han as an 'anti-Communist veteran'. Wu Han, who turned away from Enshi Hu Shi to rely on Mao Zedong. During the movement of the 1950s, Wu Han did not hesitate to insult many intellectual colleagues, for example, mocking Liang Sicheng, denouncing Hu Feng, denouncing right-wing elements and expressing firm stance. The result was still abandoned by Mao Zedong. Wu Han's thoughts on the eve of suicide did not leave a single word, at least he did not leave the words 'Long live Chairman Mao, long live', like many other suicide cadres. Mao Zedong's despicable and coldness should have made him cold between life and death. \\nWearing a right-wing hat, Chu Zhuang changed from the leading cadres of high school to the subject of supervision, selling food tickets for canteens and miscellaneous. After studying at the socialist college, 'picking hats', working in Shijiazhuang city library. Fortunately than his cousin Louis, the experience of the Air Force Junior School was relatively minor because he was young and not arrested for re-education. And all the people in the civil society who had had military and political experience in the KMT were spared by 1958, except for the United Front figures. Chu Zhuang's right-wing experience with others is both unfortunate and fortunate. He knows more than the children of other democratic figures what is wrong and what it tastes to be hit by political movements. His status today is an honorary vice-president of the Central Committee for the Promotion of Democracy of China, mainly from his father. This is a manifestation of the Communist Party's feudal tradition and a deliberate arrangement of the Communist Party personnel layout. In such a position, he could not be a critical figure. Now, in the last eight years, his words are cautious, and able to express a conversation concerned about the situation of migrant workers and to pay attention to the environmental protection of wetlands is already invaluable. Due to the hardships of 22 years of right-wing life, he will no longer be involved in the activities of the whole person. It is no longer their father and son's ability to answer the question of why China embarked on the path of communist society in the mid-twentieth century, and its assessment of the Communist Party's decades-long rule. \\nAnother Uncle\\nMy mother has no brothers, so I have no uncle. Since I was married, I had a relative who must be called my uncle. He's my wife's uncle. My wife's grandfather was doing bristle processing business in old Shanghai, and was able to maintain the eldest son, that is, the uncle, attend school and knowledge ceremony. But the uncle did not study with good work, about high school and no longer went to school. After taking over his father's workshop business, in 1949 he did not know what friends he had handed over, and was placed as a 'compulsory police officer' of the KMT. It is about the minor work of amateur assistance in policing. When the public-private partnership was merged into a bristle factory, he was one of the owners of several joint ventures, but only because he had culture, he was also chief of section for a while. Unfortunately, the good view was not long, he usually did not stop, sounded, anti-right, immediately put on the right hat. Because he was a pseudo-duty police officer, he could not count as an ordinary right, sentenced to counter-revolutionary arrest and sent to Anhui for labour. The matter is not over. Mao Zedong urged never to forget class struggles and to find the seedlings of class struggles. Some people thought that the uncle was a duty policeman and should have a gun. He said that even the official police were not enough, there was no gun, no one believed. Suspected that he threw the gun into the well in the backyard. So the Public Security Bureau transferred the pumping machine, high-pressure mercury lamp, and pulled most of the well water out, and then sent young and strong young police to take off their clothes, down to the bottom of the mud soup and pinch fine pinch, the winter and the moon, overnight dawn, shifts, and finally found nothing. The whole family was scared half to death. Decades of old wells, in case someone really throws into what bad knife, rotten iron, who can speak clearly? After completion of his sentence, he was not allowed to return to Shanghai and returned to Wujin to settle in rural areas. \\nIn the 1980s, the right was corrected, and the uncle returned to honor. A retirement salary was restored, and he was still alone in the countryside, looked at the newspapers and listened to the radio. Occasionally, a reference was made to human rights heard from the radio. \\nThere are seven of the relatives of the right alone, not including the counter-revolutionary, capitalist, landlords, capitalists and others. None of these seven people were opposed to the Communist Party. The two aunts and Chu Zhuang and Qiuhuai are fundamentally intellectuals pursuing the revolution throughout their life. Louis is a young man who resolutely left the KMT barracks to participate in the revolution. His uncle is a good and good gentleman who is not even a formal police officer. At most, it is a thief in the role of capturing thieves. However, the Mao Zedong Communist Party has spent a lot of time and effort to create enemies among the people, to rectify them and deserted construction. Since 1949, Beijing's Tiger Bridge Prison, Shanghai's Tiger Bridge Prison, and detention centers were not enough to accommodate prisoners arrested by rotating political movements. Beijing immediately built Qinghe Farm \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), then added Qincheng Prison and Xingkai Lake Farm in Heilongjiang. Jianjiangsu Dafeng Farm \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), followed by the construction of Anhui Baimaoling Farm, Juntianhu Farms, and Qinghai labor detachments have been established. Provinces and municipalities have also set up labor and re-education through labour farms. Heilongjiang, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Anhui and other places have built up hundreds of such places. Xuancheng people in Anhui said that there is no university in Xuancheng, but there are more than a dozen places of re-education through labour, and Bai Maoling and Juntian Lake are unknown in Shanghai. It is said that the construction of a labour farm is more expensive than a university because of the need for steel safety equipment, grid walls and armed configuration. In order to hold tens of millions of prisoners every year, from 1949 to the Cultural Revolution, such construction has not ceased throughout the country. \\nWhen a large number of rehabilitative notifications were issued after the Cultural Revolution, most of the inmates had long slept in the reckless beside labour camps. However, in 1956, between rebellion and anti-right, Mao Zedong wrote the words for 'The Climax of Socialism in Rural China', he said that there are still many places in rural China not only do not have a school, but also young people over school age cannot attend school, even less adult illiterate. He asked cooperatives everywhere to compile their own local literacy teaching materials, incorporating names, names, agricultural tools, agricultural work, and counties and districts also prepare regional teaching materials, provincial and municipal materials, and the central authorities only give guidance. Teachers use hometown graduates to carry out literacy. (Mao Zedong Collection, vol. 6, 456). On the one hand, a large number of intellectuals have been reformed and imprisoned, and the State expends very large amounts of money, equips the armed forces, and enlarges prisons and labor farms throughout the provinces and municipalities, holding citizens who could have been effectively built; on the other hand, there is no money in all places to build rural youths Schools, lack of funds for the production of educational materials, lack of funds for teaching and literacy teachers, and even finding suitable of teachers, have to find people with only primary school graduation level to serve as compulsory teachers. The campus of young people has been converted into a high iron network wall in labour camps. This is the German government of Mao Zedong era, which is the 'class struggle as the platform'. In the above words, Mao Zedong quoted the Russian revolutionary Lenin's famously saying: 'In a country full of illiteracy, no communist society can be built.' He didn't know about his entire life. Another Russian literary, Tolstoy, famously said: Building an extra school would make one less prison."

Our people have a good moral tradition, and in our history there have been a number of sages with high moral training. \\nMarxist Leninism gives moral words with a new and richer content. The classic writings of Marxinism have repeatedly stated that communism's morality is loyal to the motherland, to the people, to themselves and to serve the people wholeheartedly. Since liberation, the Party and the government have attached great importance to improving the moral standards of the people. With conditions of both meritocracy, every national cadre is required to adopt morality, talent and assets as the three criteria for the promotion of cadres. \\nIn recent years, however, the meaning of Germany has been distorted and understood in some places, according to their logic, the so-called virtue is: close to them, often reporting on others, nothing is vainly obedient, blind obedience, not to express independent opinions against them... under the control of this logic, some work Lili Lu, fortune for its ultimate purpose, to flatter, bragging for its The only means of villain, some of the parrot-style chongers who recite newspaper dogma as a fact and in fact are hollow, are considered to be morality incarnation. Every time they raise their salaries and join the party, they are always among the top, so they went straight up, and the official movement hengtong. \\nUnder this logic, some of those who are silent and dedicated to serving the people are held in the hands of those who do not carry out political ideas and backward. Some of the people who are unleashed, ideologically rich, often express their own independent opinions, are seen as dangerous elements of reactionary thinking; whenever political movements come, they are not the focus object, or suspicious, of all kinds of hats, like the Golden Bell Hood of the French monk, cover them on their heads, never surpassed. Only if that logic is broken will justice be done. \\nWhat is Progressive People? We say it should be someone who has a keen sense of what's new, standing ahead of the trend of the times, loving and pursuing the truth. In recent years, however, some people have created a strange logic and have tried to promote it, creating a social culture, the outline formula of this logic is: party, group members = progress; masses = backwardness. As soon as a person enters the party, various official titles follow. \\nYou ran to an organ to contact the job, the other party first asked, 'Are you a party member?' An organ hires new personnel, first to ask is whether the party member is hired? So some people will enter the regiment as a ladder to join the official and jue, so they can not fly up. \\nLong invisible relatives and friends, once met, after three words of greeting asked: 'Have you joined the party?' If the answer is 'yes,' the other party will be very respectful, and then the attitude seems particularly warm. If you answer a 'No,' the facial expression will change quickly. The initial 'uh' sound, followed by 'very good, very good,' finally 'hard to fight' to end this unpleasant conversation. As a result, some people joined the party as a 'status condition' for meeting with friends and relatives, otherwise they would be lower than third class and could not climb high. \\nUnder this logical reasoning, 600 million Chinese people have become backwarders, except for party members. As a result, a deep gulf was raised between the party groups, and people on both sides of the canal could not be reached. \\nIt is not surprising to remember that after the French Revolution, citizens were divided into positive and negative, capitalist societies. What is strange is that in socialist China, there are people artificially divided into two hierarchies according to special criteria. \\nOnly by breaking this logic can the relationship between the parties be harmonious. \\n"

				"memoirContent": "【Attached】Wang Dian: 'A Party Member of Yunnan Planning Commission Published a Systematic Anti-Party Speech'\\n(Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 12th), Party member cadre Qiandeshan (who joined the party in 1954 and learned from the People's University this year), made systematic anti-party remarks at the provincial planning committee cadre and branch assembly. Here is a summary of his anti-party remarks:\\n1. Speech at the General Assembly of Organs:\\n1, the whole air policy\\nThe policy of winding is one-sided in terms of leadership understanding. The wind has been in the planning and planning commission for a long time. It was these two days when there was no voice in the formal performance, there was no voice in the past, the wind was louder across the country, and Yunnan winds were very louder, and the Planning Commission was not very wind, perhaps the deputy department chief or above cadres were louder. \\nI think that there is a one-sided understanding of the principle of 'serious and serious, wind and rain', the head thought of the Planning Commission has a one-sided understanding, performance is not strong enough, seriously not enough. At the beginning, too much emphasis on 'and' and 'fine', as if there is no wind and rain, so it forms a little right? \\nThere was also a lack of concrete measures, and there were more comments at the end, explaining the 'absolute guarantee'. If no measure would absolutely become relative, we were not even aware of the steps, only recently scheduled a week of activities. \\nThe cadres of our organs are very dynamic, and the leadership estimates are insufficient, and they have not been used. Therefore, we should strengthen collective leadership, I think it can be done well. I propose to be serious, and rain, not to act according to personal will. \\n2. Issues of competence, authority, resources:\\nOrgans have sectarianism, especially more serious against outside the party. Some directors have no authority. Comrade Gao Pengyun is the head of the directorate. You cannot decide on a form, but also ask the Director of History. In the past, the General Office was a 'store and market department' to reflect this problem. The work of the Materials Department needed to look for Director Zhang (as was the case before the entire work of the responsible organ). Is it not the party member's leadership is very prominent and does not give him authority. Director Li would ask Director Zhang to ask Director Zhang, is it that the head of the department is a little bigger than that., not necessarily. It seems that the party director is high. Whether sectarianism can be studied. \\nClerks have no competence and responsibility, but they should also be responsible as a cadre. You got it wrong, you kid, that's what you did! The clerk formed the leadership's 'accessory', called for, waving, this is inequality, not the comrade attitude at work. Because party members are responsible for too many comrades, some chiefs of department do not have authority, especially the non-party section chiefs are all the more serious. Zhang, Shi, before acting on his behalf to the director's duties, was overpowered, and suggested: the work authority should be divided, and centralized power should be narrowed down. \\n3, talk about the issue of authority and privileges:\\nBefore the authority, I said that there is a clear manifestation that the two comrades Shi Feng and Zhang Peng are authoritative people, saying that people are not listening well, saying that the authoritative comrades are good. Many comrades said this is according to the director of history and so on. When the development of Ma Han products, Shi Feng said: 'The development of Ma Han products sensation!' \\nFollowed by the clouds of people, the chicken as an arrow. This is the reason for the inactivity that can not be played. \\nThere are two forms of performance of privilege, political superiority, economic preconceived, paid to the Director General to raise two levels in general, and power is in hand, preconceived, Lao Zi world first. \\nI have the opinion that Li Zhongjun does not promote sectarianism. He can know much more than Zhang Peng. He knows much more than Zhang Peng. His work is meticulous, serious, responsible, and loyal to the work given by the Party. What is not Germany? Party members also have a lack of virtue, Director Zhang's style, comrades also experienced profound (later also specifically). \\nI have a question. What are the criteria for the Chief of Promotion? It is necessary to promote the other chief of payment. According to the needs of his work, Director Zhang is not the standard of the Director, but does not lower the standard. Some deputy directors are not as good as clerks, and leave the clerks to eat without food! \\nAlthough the system of privileged ideas is incomplete, but the reach is very broad. Essentially, the idea of privilege is the nobility of workers. Does it promote good people are all leading cadres. It is good cadres who do not speak against their ears, cultivate hope, say inverse words. At least, this perception may be a little bit. Mentalism. \\nLeaders in front of the masses (including meetings and studies within the party and outside the party), have never heard public opinion whether the Director General has no thought, always thought that I am the director and there is no problem of thinking. I have the ability to explain to you. \\nI think through the wind should abolish privileges and narrow down authority. \\n4, personnel work issues:\\nHow many people go to the country, look at the archives do not talk about ideas Go down and talk to comrades. This work has also been done by one person in history, and now two people are engaged in, looking at the archives, not talking about ideas. Archives are not living in the past. \\nThe personnel secretary is tasteful, respectful and fearful, thinks that a high man is the head, I can control your head, you can't control my head, this is a matter of style. \\nThere is little information on thought methods, more guessing, and a little bit is a problem when I hear it, just like the scout has a little clue, there are several possibilities to analyze, etc. \\n5, party and non-party relations issues:\\nDivide is there. The first form is manifested in party organizations and party member leaders (2), are willing to pull the shortcomings of individual comrades to the boundaries or class components of the party and non-party, and everyone has shortcomings. Party members also have, if a comrade is not a party member and has thought problems, then from analyzing him from being a landlord, not occasionally And so on. Hurting the self-esteem of the family, cannot solve the problem. Only the component theory can not solve the problem. Instead, it aggravates the problem. Party members also have, why not pull to the class composition to discuss it? Of course, some should talk about ingredients, because class consciousness affects people. \\nThe second form, for some comrades instead of concern, is politically chilly, is unpleasant, although some leaders ask people to talk to people, as if a guest, were not treated as a friend of mind first. \\nThe third form, some party members and leaders can't get along equally, there are two songs, one is you talk first, the second is my opinion is... talk about thinking, to talk to each other, I just do not talk about it, if you don't treat each other equally, I will not talk about it. This also reflects my party nature has problems. I check it later. Discuss. \\nThe fourth form: people have feelings, they should know friends, know friends say something heavy, will also accept, the party and non-party are not enough in making known friends, as if I am a party member, you are my object of work. How can this be a known friend? \\nThe fifth form: regardless of the party and outside the party, the shortcomings cover everything, do not see the good side, this can not be one-sided. \\nThe sixth form: sometimes pay attention to (after the Central Provincial Committee has instructed), but only to pay attention to a few people, pay attention to the vast majority of non-party cadres is not enough, this is a kind of bias. \\nParty group relations, although there are groups of organizations, administrative councils, etc., but the organs do not have this system to talk to each other frequently and strengthen ties. \\n6, the relationship between the party and the Communist Youth League:\\nAccording to the Party Charter and the Group Chapter, the delegation is an assistant to the Party. In our organs, I have opinions, there is a 'five no'. The first one is not, does not pay attention to it, think that there are many members of the party, fewer members, and the team members can have nothing. However, how do you lead in the actual work, how do I care about the group? It can be seen. \\nThe second is not, do not understand, do not understand the requirements of the team members at various times. What exactly do we have the characteristics of our organ regiment? Characteristic is asking to join the party, why not care? \\nThe third is not, does not use, because it does not pay attention to the lack of understanding, large movements and groups to negotiate work and work for collaboration is not much. This is also true, anyway, general, are the same. \\nThe fourth no, no enlightenment. The work of the group is the style of executive order, such as thinking, always like to come to a group to criticize, or take a political class. If Wang Jin group opens a group meeting to talk about compulsory labor issues, the secretary of the regiment branch secretary Zhang ran to speak less than half an hour. It is problematic to take a political class in this way and not to solve specific problems. \\nThe fifth is not, not independent enough. Zhang Jingzhong, Liu Jinlong and Yang Huiping went to become team leaders, and the team leader of the anti-party team became deputy team leader. Gosh! I think the team members can work independently. The Zhang of the regiment only stipulates that the party's youth committee should be secretary of the team, and there is no provision for party members to be group leaders. Does it really work after going? These comrades are not the standards of Komsomol members, but the standards are stipulated in the League Chapter. \\n7, the disadvantages of counteraction:\\nIt has been a long time for the organs to counter counter, the impact is great. It shows that there are shortcomings. Many people are interested. I am also interested. Some of these interests come from a sense of truth. People always have a sense of truth. There are probably three disadvantages:\\nThe first question, which confuses counter-revolutionaries with intellectual issues, two categories (3), are confused, and two areas are ambiguous in terms of leadership. \\n1), Public opinion equals gossip, do not admit or say right, I see you are a little 'left' leaning. \\n2), Personalist sentiment equals reactionary behavior, I think that individualism is a reflection of bourgeois thinking in cadres, not reactionary acts. \\n3), Dissatisfaction with the leadership is tantamount to provoking disagreement, anti-leadership, and you have shortcomings in leadership, I'm not satisfied. \\n4), talk about friends, playing together is equal to the counter-revolutionary group, our organs are so chasing. \\n5), Thought problem plus component equals class hatred, I also said so, but I also can't make sense, but under pressure, have to say it, today I take back. Addition of our leadership is very good, the family is turned into the father's feud, the wife's feud, how much also? \\n6), Historical issues are equal to real problems. Some comrades have already dealt with in schools in the KMT and the Three Youth League, and are still being chased by reality problems. \\nTo state that there is a question to review to ask, I have no objection at all, but confusing it is wrong. \\nI think that the above issues need to be examined and not confused. Some comrades honestly talked about some issues, and the result was a whole thing. \\nThe problem of counteraction is education, but it is not that the idea of these comrades in the fight against it is equal to education. \\nBecause it was confused, the organ was skeptical and large, it seemed that there were few good people at that time. The reason is that leadership is not clear, the two areas are not clear. At that time Chairman Mao two kinds of contradictions had not yet been said. This is understandable, and the other reason is the lack of understanding and lack of material. So whole, I think it's wrong, so many comrades are dissatisfied today. \\nThe second disadvantage: anti-counter method is simple, crude, childish. \\n1/ The struggle against the enemy must always be a little art, not naive, the courts are not confessed to the main, we have the phenomenon of chasing coercion, for the generation, chasing is really deadly. Not admitting is not honest. In the past, the power of the old bag was very large, first asked, we are the Communist Party, not the boss of the package. Forced out is not real. Believe it or not, you can check the files. \\n2/ Damage self-esteem, scolding, what 'no humanity' and so on, tracking. \\n3/ The absence is unjustified and is the same as a trial. All things should be reasonable and logical, clear and reasonable, do not believe that the tension is very dynamic and vigorous. I have not worked as a people's jurors, but I know that the court does not do this. \\n4/On sidewalks. Some people are director and party responsible comrades who have rumors, they do not ask, can not recognize the sidewalk, or treat them equally, I have opinions, and later make people have side effects. Mayor of Shanghai Fu, who is higher than our director, is also counter-revolutionary, so it cannot be on the sidewalk. \\nThe downside of the third aspect is that it is not good, no knot, wrong. \\nAfter it was bad, it was wrong to deal with it. The Soviet Union also restored the reputation of being wrongly engaged in comrades. Why didn't our organs do it, why did we emphasize overcoming the role of paying? \\nOn the contrary, the conclusion has not been addressed. \\nWithout talking about it, there are shortcomings, then do not talk about it, should be addressed to all cadres. In the history of our organs, a comrade has always affirmed everything and negates everything. \\n8, the mass route:\\nProblems with the mass route are manifested in:\\n1/ Do not care about the masses, regardless of politics, thought, life, do not care, thought issues are counted as the general ledger, some comrades are very distressed, such as Li Yun-duan in the General Division Director (4), to copy something, very distressed, a person does not work than no meal. In addition to living food, housing and so on very few tubes. \\n2/ Do not contact the masses. On the issue of living, the leaders are separated away from, rarely contact with ordinary comrades, comrades hurt the influenza, the Director did not go to see if self-esteem was too strong. \\n3/Do not believe the masses, let the masses know it, do not know why, lately okay. Conscientious speaking long term good. Some masses look to be blind. Benefits and ratings often lead decisions, such as Bidao Linti two levels, we disagree, leaders decide. Leadership is not an emperor, the emperor is a golden mouth. \\n9. Issues of democratic life of organs:\\nI think that formal democracy, in fact, is undemocratic and less democratic. There are some things that are discussed by you, who knows? God knows! \\nHow many times do you take the initiative of work and discuss carefully? Opening arrangement will, I hate layout will be the most. \\nEconomically undemocratic, how many times are the accounts published? The food group announced it was too simple. Duck eggs on the street two, our corner three, I doubt, is this socialist economic law or capitalist economic law? \\nThere is no opportunity to discuss, the Executive Council will study the work, and the group group will always have a task. \\n10, political thought work issues:\\n1/ The object is not comprehensive, always those few people have problems, especially outside the party, other comrades have no thought problems? In particular, I feel strange that there is no question of leadership comrades? Chai Kuangguo is very proud. Zhang Peng is not good. I can be sure that individualism exists in our current society. \\n2/ Insufficient understanding, what is the problem of thinking? Do not understand, after hearing a little reflection as blue thunder and fall, the conclusion comes. For the original plan office Cheng Yankai, Xia Tongqing, Dong Yi and Zhang Peng concluded that three heroes were together. A comrades have shortcomings, mixed up are shortcomings, no scent, are stink, and never change. The solution is to buckle the hat. Comrade Zhang Peng said to ask a comrade: Do you believe you don't believe in the organization? This crude approach says that big democracy is not a big democracy, and that small democracy is a struggle again. \\nI have opinions about Zhou Zhe's attitude in the past. Teams and administrative councils criticized everywhere. Going to planning meetings was criticized by Comrade Bai Yiping, not to cure the disease and save people, but to fall down the stone. \\nThe subjective design of comrades of thought work, I was afraid, someone called a portrait, the portrait also looked at you. Subjective design is the subjective design. \\nIdeological work formula is 'protracted war\\+\\sports war\\+' blitz'. \\nProtracted war, some comrades found the problem today, not resolved, slowly waiting. This is a protracted war, it is negative. \\nMovement war, is to develop to a certain extent, open group meetings, branches, administrative councils. \\nBlitz, suddenly called you to review. No education first. \\nSuch a way does not work well and is conceivable. \\n11, leadership and leadership issues:\\nJust talk about one, use the issue for cadres. \\nCan not know people good, the amount of material use, only use, no training. If Zhou Zhe has a set of abilities, he does not work properly and does not work well. Recently Liang Hui studied, he was alone, Bing will all be him, but the second five year proposal is very good than one of our chief officers with a few clerks. Why do study counsellors have to be healthy, and Ji Qingchun dry, is it because they are the Director? Comrade Zhou Zhe has a set in theory. Zhou Zhe, many of our organs of minerals, do not believe, please go back and bring the same eyewear to survey them. I didn't use it well in the past, I use it better now, but I didn't work enough. \\n12, words and changes, change and efficiency issues:\\nI once said that there is a wind in the organs, the opinions raised are not much changed. This wind is the spring wind of Kunming, which is very dry. Blown the face is ash, annoying. \\nThe opinions raised by the masses have no whereabouts, they can not explain, do not explain, but review them. Self-criticism is unsatisfactory. I have opinions on the speech of Director Zhang's Eighth Congress. I gave an oil poem: 'At the meeting, Kai Ge macro tune three thousand songs, will be over the rain of light and small clouds nine.' \\nThis is what I did for the unchanging phenomenon. It was also aimed at myself, without correcting the shortcomings and building authority by executive order, which could not be done at any time. \\n13, leadership and work issues:\\nOriginally, the leadership should work, but some leaders in the Commission do not do specific work, only give instructions in principle, and only approve × × read, × × do, × × contact, etc. In this case, I will also be the Director, and any comrades will also be the Director, I do not believe I can test it. This is not a revolutionary approach. You call others to comment. Do you have any opinions? \\nThere are many problems with comprehensive balance. We also have difficulties. Leaders also know, why not take time for everyone to study it? Only study with the Director, and the Director also has only one head. The wisdom of the masses is, of course, abundant. \\nClerks have difficulty working, and the leadership rarely helps. Work is very passive, long down to spring and autumn. \\n14, know good work, quality use problems:\\n1/ Knowing the standard, the standard of our organ is how to the attitude of the leadership? Rules and rules, clothing stickers, no inverse words, leaders believe that they are good cadres, on the contrary, such as Cheng Yankai, Zhou Qiming, Li Qi have a set of capabilities. Honestly like Guochang Guochang (this comrade is very good, I do not want to frustrate him), but without the ability to take the duty officer, the results have been forced to change the election. \\n2/ the standard is 'level only', the higher the more moral. This is generally seen so, but some comrade level is lower, but virtue is not necessarily lower, can be compared to one. But it is only thought that cadres above 18 are good. \\n'Level-only theory' cannot treat cadres equally, but separately. High level comrades have more rights and less obligations. What about those more? Listen more (Director can organize life, but, take a leave to see movies. This can ask healthy government citizens. He just watched it once more.), Multiple tiers, multiple subsidy. What about those less? Do less concrete work, less responsible, less criticized, less on duty, report less thoughts, less close to the masses. This is a reflection of sectarianism within the party. \\n15, the Director's 'ass' problem:\\nThe Director's butt question can be talked about, and maybe everyone doesn't like the inspection. Some party chiefs ass are sharp and unstable. Such as Xia Tongqing's opinion on the branch at the meeting within the Party, everyone thinks that there are shortcomings in the branch work. Jian and government people have another view that they do not adhere to justice, so the butt is sharp, because of the different angle of the ass. But there should be one standard-justice, truth. \\nSecond, the ass is seated. Some officers are higher than the officers, proud of (6), full, very scary. For example, Zhou Yinghua is afraid of Chai Kuangguo. Party member directors can not participate in business studies. If the director of history rarely participates, I see general comrades know more than the Director on some issues, and there is nothing to be said. Talk about thought issues, opinions, think of yourself as the chief, talent correctness. Concluding remarks and concluding remarks. These phenomena are not quite equal. \\n16, wrong words, the book does not pass the problem (the words to be true, the meaning of the book to pass)\\nThe executive will often be centerless, very messy, talk about the subject is not warm, talk about eating, wearing relish. No words, no dispute, contention, no voice, and indecision. In this way, the problem cannot be profound and not raised, and it is suggested that the atmosphere of theoretical learning can be debated in order to obtain a deeper result. \\n17, the speakers' innocence, the problem:\\nOur organs can be said, on the other hand there are shortcomings:\\nSpeakers have two kinds of pressure, one is pressure from public opinion, and the first is the pressure of leadership analysis. Often opinions are much more mentioned, and there is always public opinion how this is. A comment, sometimes the leadership will always be linked to the shortcomings of this person to analyze, such as when dividing the house, I'm in it, really eat. These are stress. \\nIneffectiveness is also a stimulus, a setback in motivation. \\nWhether or not innocence is generally innocent, but some issues are innocent, guilty implicitly, guilty must be punished, implicitly punished, secretly punished, settled by air, and heavy indebtedness. It is also a clever way of bureaucracy. Some comrades come on the plane as soon as they argue their thoughts. \\nThose who have a ring, change the ring to target, to target people, turn the ring into a wall, to defend. \\nThat's it to me, there is a gossip at the time of rebellion, and this is a good opportunity. After some comrades gave advice to the leadership, there was a gap and turned into walls. \\nII. Speech at the Party Branch Assembly\\nAbout the party winds, there are a few questions to think about, talk about their own views:\\nFight against the problem: both affirm and negate. There are also achievements, shortcomings and mistakes, and the salient problem is: I think the means used in rebellion are unsatisfactory, and there is a reason for the comrades in our organs to be interested in counteracting, which is revealing our shortcomings. \\nSome means do not correspond to the treatment of citizens of a People's Republic of China, let alone for officials in state organs, such as searching methods for mastering materials and turning the box on Fan Le. I did not advocate, but I could not intervene. People who are emotionally commuting to work, eating or stool are followed, called 'tracking and tracking' this means can also be taken, but it can't be so, such a method is naive, really a counter-revolution, so it can not be observed. According to article 89 of the Constitution, this is a violation of human rights, and with regard to personal freedom, I do not want to explain that everyone knows that it is protected as long as it does not violate the Constitution. \\nIn accordance with article 90 of the Constitution, to go to a person's home, whether public or secret, is also called a violation of human rights. \\nRelocation of Li by administrative order. According to the Constitution, the people have freedom of residence. \\nOur planning committee is illegal in the fight against the law. Some comrades will say that it is possible to do so within the party. We can look at the party statutes, stipulate in the party statutes that party members comply with the laws of the Party and the State. The constitution is formulated by the Communist Party of China, and our party members should implement. I have been unable to think about this issue, such human rights violations hit me. I must have to file a civil lawsuit, and I have a basis for doing so. Party members can always appeal to the Central Committee. I say this not to incite this part of the people to complain, but it is our duty to defend the laws of the country. \\nI complain here that, because Chairman Mao has said 'there is no need to do so, there is a need to fix it', our leaders have not reviewed the criminal acts, and this should be corrected. Is it done with the thought support of whom? It should be done in accordance with the law and party statutes, and those who enforce them may not understand the law and should be educated. \\nThis is not without influence among the masses. One is yes, there are achievements, one is that there are shortcomings, hoping to correct this in the wind, believe it or not can go to research. There is also a reason why some people are interested in the rehabilitation proposed by democrats. \\nThis first shows that our comrades and bureaucracy are too great, one of them without prior knowledge and knowledge. Another is that bureaucracy has a magic force, lawlessness, can also be said to be illegal. On the other hand, because some comrades are unhealthy and brutal means, in fact this is not the end, we do stupid things, and the other reason is not concerned about new things, regardless of the Constitution and the constitution, we do it. I hope that party organizations and anti-opposition leaders will be clear in the middle of the wind. Right, just right. If it is wrong, it will review, and the Communist Party apologize is not not there, the central authorities have. This is due to intellectual arbitrariness. In the 17 powers of the State Council, there are no human rights violations committed by the Planning Commission, and it is recommended that these comrades learn more.

But for me it was only for my distress and misfortune. \\nThis is a democratic revolution movement, (Department of Socialist Thought Education, Nankai University: rampant attack against the party by the right.), This is the death of the democratic spirit. Long live democracy! (Department of Socialist Thought Education, Nankai University: This is the slogan that Qiu wenzhi shouted in the dormitory, claiming to be a demonstration of the regiment books.), Our socialism is the absolute rule of three hazards, and the three hazards are the product of the system. China is a semi-colonial semi-feudal society, and its personality is not fully developed, China does not have capitalism. Therefore, there is insufficient attention to human personality. This movement is also a spiritual revolution that calls for the liberation of personality. \\nThe book is a privileged member of the privileged class, the proud son of the party, the tyrant of the masses. \\nLet's burn the socialist fire! Beat sticks, (Department of Socialist Thought Education, Nankai University: This big print not posted by Nyeu.), \\nFollow the party, it is always wrong, but sometimes difficult; to whisper, only the promise, but always have to learn it, to learn to live. \\nI read the newspaper every day, blurred my mind, and I'm afraid to think independently. It is certainly necessary, but there are side effects that can be eliminated if you do well at the beginning, not passive on leadership, do not give up leadership. \\nI am now working on a new exploration of my whole life, and I am very stuffy in my mind. It is likely to return to the same state of mind as it was two years ago. (Excerpt from Qiu wenzhi's letter to Wu Yun on June 18.), \\nLife is relentless, in the modern times, no one can avoid the impact, the weak fall down, the strong survive, 'life is an endless struggle'? But the poor thing is that we are neurasthenic patients. Nothing in the past can't forget, the present and not adapt to it, therefore, for the future more dare to aspire. I'm afraid that the depression disease of Lei Jinggui, intellectual-disease, is not more than these! \\nIn this new China, which is full of struggles (social, political, moral, psychological,), sharp Mercedes, is it not a naive idea of deceiving people if you want to avoid stray bullets and think that drilling your head in the life of ancient books is a great deal of all things? You too book angry, life is ruthless. \\nWe were very polite at the time, but how could those who were accustomed to rebuking others? However, I am reasoned. \\nI am now spiritually heading toward a serious division, good? Or get bad? I don't know. Anyway is wandering halfway, up and down to ask for it. (Excerpt from Qiu wenzhi's letter to Wu Yun on July 10)\\nYou are too cowardly, incompetent, to take the initiative to change the ability to dissolve yourself mentally against the enemy in nature. Be sober, look at reality, think about the future, as a person to realize the title of 'human'. Wouldn't it be too pity to be like those poor and weak beings who are displaced in the world, and see the flesh withered, the heart is always boundless darkness, never emits a flames of life? If it was like those souls without any pursuit, although full of love of life, but just like a spring tree full of flowers, society, despite giving it glory and happiness, it is only dotted with a walking dead body.

Father Qiu yongyin Gong Gan, a student of Whampoa Military School. Manqing dynasty joined the alliance, followed the revolution of Sun Yat-sen Lao. He was appointed governor of Yunfu County of Guangdong Province (that is, county governor), and director of public security. Because of the year over a flower, go hometown. During the period of a two-year suspension of the death penalty, a colleague in Guangzhou was informed, and the local government was released from home to save one death. \\nI was able to attend Jiaoling Secondary School because of fatherhood and the death of my brother as a martyr in the War of Resistance against Japan and took care of the secondary school. During my studies, with the idea of progress, I often contacted with progressive students, and learned that Fujian Wuping had Lan Sky in Jiaoling Middle School propaganda activities. The purpose of the activity is: to arouse secondary school students to read for the cause of liberation, for the liberation of labourers, economic conditions cannot be read, can stand up Participate in the revolution in guerrilla groups under the leadership of the Communist Party. This sowed the seeds of the revolution in my heart. In May 1949, when liberating the city of Jiaoling County, the guerrillas came to my house. At 7:00pm that night, I was still studying homework in the room. A guerrilla captain went to my room and said to me: Tomorrow will liberate Jiaocheng. Can you take up the revolutionary spirit to be a guerrilla guide? I resolutely promised him 'OK.' The guerrillas and I, taking advantage of the night, risked their lives, and did not take the right path to take the guerrillas safely to the Wo Miaoli near the Qiu yongyin Shiheng Memorial Pavilion near the Xiapo Bridge leading to Meixian. The next day they successfully liberated Jialideng and did a very valuable thing for the liberation cause of Jiaoling. In July 1949, I graduated from junior high school, privately tandem Qiu yongyin Qi Kai (formerly Wuping County traffic director), Qiu yongyin Guisheng (formerly a member of Wuping Literary Corps), Qiu yongyin Qiguang (because of leakage was stopped by his father after being intercepted by his father to become a teacher), Lu Blue Strict, endured starvation, after a few days of exploration, finally found The Communist Party led guerrillas were integrated into a ten-regiment of Dawn political workers, and later incorporated into the Wuping County Cultural Workers Group. Since then, freed the feudal family and began my revolutionary career, which was my 'first liberation'. \\nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China, I still carried out propaganda work in the Wuping Literary Works Corps, in cooperation with the 299 regiment of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, carrying out propaganda performances in Yongping, Taoxi, Dahe and Jiangxi Huichang and Junmenling. In March 1950, I was officially a member of the New Democratic Youth League. In June 1950, after the consolidation of the civil society, the civil society was assigned to the Wudong Ward Government as a member of the Land Reform Corps and later appointed as a district government instrument. In December 1952 due to misappropriation of the marriage fee of 80,000 yuan (now $8), at that time, the organization expelled me home for the first reason for embezzlement of public funds; second, the son of a pseudo-county governor; third, a small landlord of family composition; and fourth, the leadership at the time was dissatisfied with me. When I wanted to depart from the family to participate in the revolution, I was expelled from my home for more than three years in the first and last three years. After I appealed to the Organization Department of the County Committee, I was honored to organize Minister Zhang Kui and Officer Li Xin, and then assigned me to Gaowu Central Elementary School and Lingyan Central Elementary School to teach during my teaching period., working tirelessly for the Communist Party's cause of education. When fighting against the right in 1957, I was classified as the 'right' of the rock zone. After more than half a year of re-education through labour in the county, the Education Department announced that 'Qiu yongyin Yongyin was expelled from public office and sent home, and harvested rosin for 21 years in the countryside, has suffered hardships and refined the will. \\nIn August 1978, received a notice from the Propaganda Department of Wuping County Committee, announcing the removal of the hats of right-wing elements and resuming the original work. The leadership also gave me a message of consolation, encouragement, and assigned to Iwanqian Shangfang middle school tasks for general tasks. Then his wife, who taught far in Qingliu County, also returned to Iwamae Fuhu Elementary School to teach. More than twenty years of grievance came to the snow, the couple reunited, and the political shackles were lifted, this was my 'second liberation.' \\nWith the furthering of the chaos and anyway, the implementation of all the Communist Party's policies and policies, swept out the haze, Yu Yu clarified, the Party's wise policies were not only implemented on me, but even my father, who died for many years, also restored his reputation and gave an objective and impartial evaluation, and his deeds were faithfully documented in Jiaoling County Cultural and historical data, CPPCC. Then good news spread, in October 1999, my superior informed me from retired cadres to enjoy the treatment of retired cadres of '5·12\\, and escaped the economic difficulties. In May 2002, I changed my retired cadre '5·12' to 'retired cadre', based on my original status and the firm time of participation in the revolution. Comrades, colleagues and friends congratulated me on my 'third liberation'. \\nI am eighteen-old this year and have participated in the work for more than 60 years. My honor and treatment today is thanks to the Communist Party! Thanks to Deng Xiaoping! My heart shouted: Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live! I sincerely wish the great motherland to prosper! Increasingly rich!

In this sport, Guangxi was blattered 100 percent of the right hat. But the negative impact of the campaign cannot be underestimated; the depth of the poison and the scourges planted are difficult to remove. Fear of speeches, fear of criticizing others, especially with regard to leadership cadres, corruption and corruption, dare not to criticize, let alone struggle. This is not something that can naturally disappear from one generation or two generations. I want to promote the fight against corruption forward. It is not clear about corruption and cannot build a just and harmonious society. The central government is determined to fight corruption, and as an old Communist Party member, hopes that there may be some indication of this movement, and may be of some benefit to the current anti-corruption efforts. \\nIn that anti-right movement, some leaders themselves are corrupt. The cadres below have revealed that not only do not change, they are in the heart of hate, opportunity to retaliate, and even use the power of their hands to carry out a relentless blow in the fight against the right, a number of them. After 26 years of rethinking, as measured by the anti-right policy at the time, I should not be the right, but the left in the revolution. \\nI am Guangxi Lingui, my ancestors have been begging to Guangxi for more than 260 years, all relying on the mountains to work day. Single flyer, unaware, suffered by no culture, by the pit of the dam, thieves again and again. According to the ancestral ancestors, one ancestor was buried alive and buried alive because of the prostituting one woman, the tomb swept the hour, and the elders come to this tomb every year In a particularly deserted year, people from outside, less people are always robbed, became a mass robbery, in more than 200 years, three times relocated, unknown, a few mu thin fields, endure the suffering of no culture. Let me go to school, go to school, do not want to say anything more. Entrance into Guangxi Guilin middle school, it is not easy. But here, influenced by progressive ideas, became the backbone of the KMT against corruption. Along with other progressive students, Gui Zhong led three times of learning: first, on June 4, 1989, the 'Six Four Movement' marched in Gui Da, namely, anti-civil war, anti-hunger, anti-persecution; second, Qin Qiang teacher died of poverty and lifted coffin march in April 1949 (with photo). The film 'Guilin City' also reflects our struggle; third, because of the so-called 'On Democracy in Guilin' published a distorted report by the Guilin Central Daily, and sent representatives to negotiate and ask the party to correct the truth was refused. Caused Quangui high school students to go to the newspaper office, and people went empty, that is, destroying the newspaper and the printing factory in Jiashan; and changed the 'Central Daily' to 'Sangma Daily' and 'rumor', etc., and the Central Bank of Jiefang East Road, could not send staff salaries and student meals on time to Guangxi University. The Central Bank was changed to 'kind of bad banks'. Becoming a living treasure in Guilin, attracting the general public to watch, set off the climax of the second front of the KMT ruling area. Accelerated the collapse of the KMT and played a role. But the enemy wants to make final struggles, secret agents went to school to capture progressive students. In a hurry, did not dare to stay in school for a long time, absconded at night, evading the capture of enemy agents. In the enemy area is one of the key opponents of the KMT, one of the temporary leaders, how can it become a 'right'? \\nSecond, go up the mountain guerrilla. Sneak back to the countryside, that is, in my remote position at the frontier, Guibei sent to Ho Kang, Yang Fan and Li Lin (both pseudonym), to sneak back to Liutang. Together with the progressive students returning home, the first to engage in the activities of the people's movement, collect the bureaucrats, and soon build dozens of people's 'the seventh brigade of the Road East detachment of the Gubei People's Liberation Corps' Call the people to turn over the team), in order to meet the arrival of the corps, get through from Linyang go to Shiotian appointed me as the third martial arts captain, receive Departing to Linyang junction, when the team entered the Xingping territory belonging to Yangshuo, the team because of the change of the situation to the tidal field and then shrunk xingan noble; decided to withdraw the martial arts team back to the brigade. About half a month, the army liberated Guilin. My seven brigade with the army in six tang division. Give us two tasks: one before the branch, the second is to liberate the unliberated countryside. From my history has always been at the forefront of the enemy, that there dare to be the right to fight the enemy? \\nEnemy backlash, home hardship happens. When my brigade liberated a large area of township. After the tragic events, that is, I entered Lingui Public Security Bureau, the enemy sees me as a thorn in meat, every effort to arrest me, uprooted a nail on the frontier, many times catch me not. On February 23, 1950, the first eight lunar lunar month, a nephew was married and thought I would return to eat a good wine. He did not go back, and did not capture me, took away all the belongings of the house, burned down the house, and eight fathers and brothers were killed. \\nThe bandits who attacked my house total of more than 100 people, including the main culprit, are agents, pseudo-commune chief, such as:\\n① Shizhu Heng, Guibei Military Uniform Lieutenant Colonel Agent Head, LinGui South Mountain Xinsheng Village\\n② Mo Guangfen, Tangtou Pseudo Township, Tangtou Township Muqiaotou Village, our army has not attacked the pseudo-township office before entering the mountain into Shizuheng\\n③ Zu Ge Wei, Tangtou Shanbei village, Tang tou Township Office pseudo-township team deputy, often armed about twenty people, equipped with a machine gun, rifle, short gun more than twenty branches, when I armed siege in mountainback village, weapons after the village of mountain rock siege his family three hours before surrender. is one of the perpetrators of the attack on my family;\\n④ Renegade River, Tangtou Wujing village people, Tangtou liberation, camouflage progress, went to my brigade, appointed Tangtou tax collector, in the tax, due to no supervision, the tax revenues turned into Shizhu Hengshan for the military quartermaster;\\n⑤ Li Shihei, Tang Wujing village people's big cellar mouth, lived in my home village, former mayor, village leader, led the same village of customary rogue Wang ×, Wang × ×, Wang × × × and Wujing village landlord Huang × × with the mountain as bandits;\\n⑥ Huang × ×, Wujinggou River Bridge village, pseudo village chief, Ben Shizhu Heng bandits, more than a few people visit me, especially heard that I entered the public security bureau, into meat thorn, dream to catch me day and night. My family nephew married on February 23, 1950 (that is, the first eight lunar lunar month), dawn around my house, the machine gun shot at the home after the stone mountain, tomorrow can not attack, set fire, and do not see me inside, grab my father and brother 8 people, one shot dead on the spot, one shot outside the door, three shot and kill Ping Ping The mountain, my father and monk under 15 years old brother, plus a nephew killed Jingxi Village Fire Ping, buried a mountain potato In the pit; sacrifice more than January, pulled out, father was seven holes of bloodshed, brother is full of gunshot eyes, this is my family tragedy process, should not share God's hatred with the enemy, but sneak into the revolution landlords Chang Mingyu take advantage of the right opportunity to retaliate. Anything to retaliate me into the right. \\nFourth, from the anti-right harm fact:\\n① In July 1957, before the anti-right district authorities carried out sweeping, had gone to Guanyang, did not participate in the liberation, did not attack the party's words and deeds, then it came to the anti-socialist fact. \\n② Without the actual material, he will make democratic life within the party, criticize him for playing with several women, hateful, unable to find specific materials in school, and do not hesitate to undermine the provisions of democratic life within the Party: 'Criticism and self-criticism, without words, words are innocent', 'no words are guilty,' and 'others will be changed', disregarding the principle of 'no less humble', so it took out the materials of democratic life within the Party. Criticism of manipulating women with corruption. The record of all party group life (the group life was once a week), was moved out into anti-socialist anti-socialist words and deeds, which would be used to treat a revolutionary comrade in this way. \\nIn addition, ten right-wing (more than 30 units), to be dealt with, and asked them to make atonement. They also spoke about a number of different issues, such as comrade Li Ang Wuming armed banditry, suspected of being suspected of banditry, and was arrested for nearly two years for review, until the riot first had clearly confirmed that he had no suspicion of banditry and concluded that he had no suspicion of bandits. Work in the public security school. Fight against and continue to fight with raw materials, I think fried old rice is unnecessary, it is an attack against the major evil. It is a matter of decades-old opposition to the right, and dozens of times. \\nI was a family and died, and was the vice-president of the public school, Chang Mingyu (landlord), and became the right, because he was outside the forty, abandoned the rural children and daughters of his original wife, that is to marry Chen × × × married in Guangxi, more than his young beautiful woman, saliva, see south marry Chen × thin, filed for divorce was refused. In order to force women into a model, use power to illegally confined girls in a school room. The female party did not show weakness, broke out. Helpless to ask her to work south of the Dead Party, shifted Chen × × to another place of confinement and forced her to divorce. Marriage with many girls in school was refused because of their age differences. After marrying a girl from Guilin overseas Chinese school, she was divorced less than January. The court branch discussed, I was one of the supporters firmly opposed. He expressed resentment and resentment at the party team because he was playing with women's sexual corruption criticism and struggle. \\nBefore the release of 1957, also in Lingui Sitang practice life, transferred back to Guanyang County Committee propaganda Department work. After more than a year after leaving the dry school, the district ended straight and right. In the pending stage, more than 30 people were excluded from the right of the public security school, ten people were hit into the right. I was held on this 'right-wing' hat for 21 years. The Kuomintang called me 'co-bandits' and 'rapists' want to arrest me, burn the house, and eight of my father and brother were killed, and the KMT agents did not share daily hatred. The corpse of his father and brother was not cold and framed into the right by the party landlord. While calling the rapist, while inflicting it into the 'right', in the end, who am I, by way of this and above, not only unresolved, turned the report back to Guanyang, the Siqing Cultural Revolution, in order to die and not repent the 'right-wing' wearing a three-foot cap, tied to the street, whipping, beating, fainting the streets, almost to the west with his father and his brother Day. Wounded home, the old mother cried; three-year-old son and wife went no way, she helped a good old farmer, sent medicine to home at night, wiped inside and outside to save the life, just able to move and sent to prison; the three-year-old son sent back home, resulting in starvation and death. \\nRight rebellion is different from the rest of the right. In August 1978, Comrade Hu Yaobang proposed that the right party should review. The following went to Guanyang Organization Department, that is, in October, sent to Zhang × duo project to investigate my problem. At that time, the public security school was suspended, cadres had been scattered throughout the district, and the school was originally delineated by right-wing elements have gone to several farms to re The working group examined and screened by right-wing sources in that year. They found that Chang Mingyu victims of corruption in public security schools were too prominent. The school was just over 30 people and 10 were classified on the right. To inflict me on three fronts: first, the party summary records of that year were distorted into a crime, undermining democracy within the Party; second, mobilizing the right to deal with a crime and make up for harm; and the third is to take out of context and fight against retaliation from the individual dead parties that are constantly turning. The team who went to investigate was amazed by the fact that I had always been strong revolutionaries as right, 21 years of wrongs, wrote more than 10,000 statements (this material is in my file), first for me in January 1979. \\nAlthough the organization believes that I was wrong for the right. Individuals have flouted their indignation, retaliated, violated the party laws and laws of the Party and the party law without accountability. How to clear the corruption problems of individual people in power in the Party at the beginning of corruption, such as Cheng Kejie in Guangxi and Hu Changqing in Jiangxi, is by no means formed one day. Their problems were known at the beginning of the beginning. It is afraid of reprisals, and has developed to the point of inexorbitability and is severely punished by the law. Therefore, the negative impact brought by the anti-right parties against the reverse flow of fear of opinions on the leadership is not considered because of their own victimization. The elderly or young people who have not been victimized also have the same idea, do not clear this flow of poison, and the central government has said more corruption. This is 26 years of reflection. \\n26 January 2006"

Qiu zhe showed great admiration for Deng Yan Da field trip: 'Watch the fineness of its research affairs, marvel, this solid energetic overman, but also only the practice of dialectical matter.' Deng Yanda hopes very high for Qiu zhe. Qiu zhe intended to translate the book 'The Economy of Capitalism', because the book has already been translated, Deng Yanda wrote to remind: 'Please note and don't vain effort! We're going to translate more books. Please have the time to translate more books on Sino-British political and economic relations, especially before 1900.' After liberation, Qiu zhe himself paid these letters to be printed into a book, the book called 'Break Gold Zero', also take the 'two people concentric, their profit break' meaning, to commemorate his revolutionary friendship with Deng Anda. The book is not for sale, collect Deng Yanda traveled to Europe sent to Qiu zhe, the remaining 7 letters, titled 'Mr. Choice', and Qiu zhe himself made more than 50 old body poems, such as 'Suez Canal', 'Egypt', 'Tour of the Palace of Versailles', and so on, the title of 'Teifu leftover' 'Draft'. One of the first 'North Korea Lee Zhishi in the Pacific Boat':\\nForming lip tooth decay, I also praised tiger wolf. \\nOn this day, the same boat on the other side, phase the hepatobiliary \\n'North Korea Lee Chi Shi' is no longer available. \\nA dozen photos are attached to the book. \\n'Stronger outrage in the sea, I do not hesitate to throw the head\\nIn 1930, Deng Yanda secretly returned home, Qiu zhe travelled to Europe and the United States after returning home, also came to Shanghai, together with Deng Yan Da planning, actively carry out party work. They jointly advocated the succession of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's three major policies, proposed opposing imperialism, eliminating feudal forces, overthrowing Nanjing reactionary rule, establishing a civilian regime focused on agricultural laborers, practicing cultivators and transitioning to socialism through state capitalism. On August 9, 1930, Deng Yan Da hosted the first national cadre meeting attended by representatives of ten provinces and districts at the residence of Li Jinhui, Saposai Road (now Danshui Road), in Shanghai. The meeting adopted the political platform 'Our Political Proposition' and elected Deng Yanda as Director General. It decided on the names and heads of the various functional departments of the central organs, including the Organizational Committee, the Publicity Committee, the Design Committee (later changed to the Military Committee), the Committee on Civil Transport, the General Committee, the Committee on Overseas Chinese Affairs, and the subsequent establishment of a training committee. The central authorities are located in Shanghai French Concession Aimai Yuzhu Road 159 (now Shaoxing Road 41). After the establishment of the Interim Action Committee of the KMT, the main taps of the struggle have been directed towards the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek group and actively carried out organizational, propaganda and military work. During his stay in Shanghai, Qiu zhe had close ties with the Chinese Communist Party clandestine workers and actively cover them for revolutionary activities. \\nOn August 17, 1931, Deng Yanda was arrested for the sale of a traitor. Chiang Kai-shek, while arresting Deng Yin Tat, had deluded to beat up the Interim Action Council's comrades in Shanghai. The central organs and contact points of the Interim Action Council were seriously damaged. At 7 o'clock in the evening, the agent went to Huang Qixiang's house to search for his house. Huang Qixiang regularly carried out activities outside the country and carried out military liaison. He went home very late every day, and the agents were hiding in the living room of the Yellow Family waiting. Huang Qixiang family deliberately turned on the first, second and third floors together with the kiosk and kitchen lights. Huang Qixiang returned home late at night, looking to the whole floor lights clear, informed. He quietly came to the Qiu zhe family living with Yong'an, Qiu zhe's wife was Japanese, specifically went to the Nongtang mouth to call the taxi to the door of the Qiu House, Qiu zhe couple sent Huang Qixiang to the car, again to help Huang Qixiang escape from the tiger mouth. \\nDeng Yanda was killed in November 1931. Qiu Che was extremely angry, conferred poetry to mourn Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary act: 'The world's eyes and ears are hard to hide, this fangs and liver Cry out: 'The same voice in the sea exhorts outrage, I do not hesitate to throw Qiu zhe is determined to take grief into strength, inherit and implement Deng's ideas, revitalize the organization and continue its revolutionary activities against Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule. Qiu Che moved to Hong Kong from Shanghai and lived in Kennedy Road. She participated in the Meixian predominantly Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce, focusing on liaising with overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots. \\nIn 1931, 9.18 Incident, Chiang Kai-shek took no resistance to the Japanese imperialist aggression, and the Eastern Three Provinces fell. Qiu Che was outraged by the creation of the 'Action' oil-print publication in Shanghai, and wrote an article to expose and rebuke Chiang Kai-shek's policy of inresistance. Following the fall of Northeast, the Japanese army launched another 12.8 incident, and the situation is very critical. The 19th Road troops stationed in Shanghai rallied to resist. Qiu zhe worked closely with 19 road generals Cai Tingkai and Jiang Guangnai, and launched overseas fundraising to support the war of resistance. Qiu zhe, daughter of the sixth grade of elementary school, Qiu Xuemei returns home every day, to help his father transcribe the manuscript. Qiu zhe told her daughter that the Japanese imperialism had reached its feet from 9.18 and launched the 12.8 Songhu war in an attempt to encroach Shanghai as a base for attacking the mainland of China. After the manuscript was translated, Qiu zhe took her daughter to the bookstore to deliver and proofread Mrs. Qiu zhe risked her life and rescued her friends several times from the rainmouth of artillery fire, and she herself was suspected of being a Japanese rape. Although she was Japanese, she was still detained and beaten. Two months later, she was released for unsubstantiated evidence. Body scale wounds. \\nIn April 1932, Chen Cheng invited Huang Qixiang and Qiu zhe to his home Zhejiang Qingtian as guest, and wanted to take the opportunity to dispense. During a walk after dinner, Chen Cheng said that the current affairs person is Junjie. You still give up the 'Third Party' (that is, the Interim Action Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang), and go to Nanjing to become officials. Qiu zhe did not have a positive reply, chanting his own seven laws 'crying comrade Deng Zesheng killed' a show of heart:\\nThe blood is full of rivers and lakes, rongde is difficult. In the sea, whatsoever throws his head. \\nThe world's eyes and ears are finally hard to hide, this fangs and liver is Melancholy life with a glass of wine, looking at the shadow of the wall. \\nThe poem is full of remembrance of Deng Yanda and hatred for the reactionaries. 'Poetry and Chi', Chen Cheng listened to, silent. \\nQiu zhe moved to Hong Kong from Shanghai and participated in the Meixian predominantly Hong Kong Jiaxuan Chamber of Commerce, focusing on liaising with overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots. \\nIn 1933, Huang Qixiang and Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai and other events in Fujian launched. Qiu zhe was in Shanghai and immediately rushed to Fuzhou. The Fujian People's Government, which resists Japan and anti-Chiang, has established the country number and the national flag. Qiu zhe was a member of the Economic Committee of Fujian People's Government. Chiang Kai-shek sent a large number of Lu Hai Air Force to attack Fujian. The troops of the Fujian People's Government, under the command of Huang Qixiang, struggled to resist, finally failed because of their power differences. Five members of the Provisional Action Committee, including Jiang Dongqin, who had participated in a meeting, were marvelously sacrificed. Fujian people's government failed, and the temporary action committee was again hit hard. Qiu zhe returned to the Songkou of Meixian County. \\nQiu zhe proposed to relocate Gongyuyuan Rice Store (after the Xinhai Revolution Revolution), to Matsuguchi Park, the revolutionary organ of the pre-revolutionary confederation of Xinhai, to Matsuguchi Park, and build a new museum to commemorate the Songguchi League and the Shinhai Revolutionary Guild. The proposal was supported and sponsored by people from home and abroad. The new library began construction in 1934, and was completed a year later. Mr. Qiu zhe is curator, personally wrote and set a monument to remember the matter. \\nIn 1935, Qiu zhe went to Hong Kong to discuss with Zhang Bojun, Peng Zemin and Guo Guanjie to resume the organization of the 'KMT Interim Action Committee', responding to the 'Eighth Declaration' of the Communist Party of China calling for unity against Japan. The Interim Action Committee has been repeated and has experienced a failure. During this period, the Communist Party of China and its led Red Army, through the Zunyi Conference, miraculously achieved a great victory of 25,000 miles long march. These historical facts have prompted Qiu zhe and the other leaders of the Interim Action Council to reflect on the path of national liberation, to draw up their experiences and deepen their understanding. After many failures and setbacks, the Interim Action Council leaders recognized that 'the Communist Party is the main thrust of the revolution' and the guarantee of the victory of the Chinese revolution, 'it must be in contact with the Red Army.' Based on this understanding, Qiu zhe and other letter businessmen in Germany, Huang Qixiang, obtained his consent. The Interim Action Committee held a second dry meeting in Kowloon, Hong Kong in November 1935, and decided that the Yi Party would be named the Chinese National Liberation Action Committee. The change in the name of the party is to show a complete break with the Kuomintang and remove the 'China Kuomintang' hat; second, to adapt to the new situation of the revolution, show that national liberation is its duty; and third, to take care of historical traditions and retain the title of 'action committee'. The meeting established the general policy of 'anti-Jiang Union against Japan' and decided 'to cooperate with the Communist Party and use Marxinism as the Party's ideological weapon.' Qiu zhe attended the Ergan Conference and was elected member of the Central Interim Executive Committee and secretary of the Central Finance Committee. The Second Gan Conference was an important turning point in the history of the A&M Party. Since then, the A&M Party began a new process of cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party. After the meeting, Qiu zhe participated in various political and social activities on behalf of the Committee for Liberation Action (COPREDEL), on several occasions, promoting solidarity against Japan. Here, Qiu Zefu 'by the Fujian Sea (organizing people's government failure), return to Hong Kong sense of student selection comrades photo':\\nLife has a few lives, and death is righteous. Shuo wind blowing up the banners, independence is more sentimental. \\nAfter the incident in Xi'an, Qiu zhe wrote 'Against the Civil War, Unite Against Japan', published in the Party organ publication 'Nanpin'. \\nIn 1937, the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out, many young students were involved in the anti-Japanese rescue campaign. Whether young students should 'save the nation and not forget to read books' or should 'read and save the nation', that is, they should study in spite of the country's national crisis, or should actively engage in the fiery struggle against Japanese salvation. At that time, two kinds of tit-for-tat ideas emerged. Qiu zhe actively participated in this debate and wrote the book 'Chinese Youth', and called out loudly that young students should care about politics, care about the fate of the nation, and should be on the front line of anti-Japanese salvation. His voice has had a certain influence among young students. \\nThe Japanese invading army entered Shanghai on August 13 and broke out the famous '8,13\\ Shanghai Resistance War. Huang Qixiang, who returned from Europe, served as deputy commander of the eighth group army guarding the Shanghai right-wing corps, and then the deputy commander-in-chief of the former enemy headquarters and commander-in-chief of the eighth group army, directly involved in commanding the Ronghu war. Qiu zhe and Huang Qixiang are closely engaged in the work of the action committee, mobilized the masses, organized anti-Japanese support teams, raised condolences to combat troops, and give strong support to Shanghai's resistance war. \\nAfter the fall of Shanghai, Qiu zhe returned to Meixian Songkou's home, not long at home, that is, rushed to Wuhan. \\nIn the spring of 1938, North China, East China and other places suffered successively, and the calls for unity against Japan spread across all regions, forcing the Kuomintang to restructure the National Government Military Commission in Wuhan and set up a political ministry. Chen Cheng as minister, Zhou Enlai and Huang Qi-xiang as deputy ministers, and Qiu zhe served as the design committee of the Ministry of Political Affairs. At this time, Qiu zhe regularly met with Zhou Enlai, Ye Jianying and democratic people in Hankou to discuss the expansion and development of the anti-Japanese national united front. Qiu zhe and Communist Party people Wen Jiangong were in close contact with Ye Jianying, the Wuhan Eighth Route Army Office. With their help, Qiu zhe has strengthened ties with parties and members of the community, widening the impact of the war of solidarity and resistance. Qiu zhe used the relationship to introduce Wen Jian Gong to the first hall of the Military Commission as section chief. Qiu zhe also encouraged his son, nephew and fellow countrymen to invite their young friends to North Shaanxi to participate in the great cause of national liberation. Under the guidance and support of Zhou Enlai and Ye Jianying, Qiu zhe and Huang Yanpei organized a 'unification society', advocating democracy, unity and resistance to Japan. Qiu zhe left a lot of inscription on the memorial book: Zhou Enlai's inscription is 'Adhere to unity, implement always, win against resistance, win to build a nation'; Ye Jianying's inscription is 'Only by strengthening national unity can prevail over Japanese imperialism'; Li Jishen's inscription is 'First of all, let the enemy be victorious.' \\nOn March 1, 1938, the Chinese National Liberation Action Committee held the Third National Conference of Cadres in Wuhan. Qiu zhe attended the meeting and continued to be elected as a member of the Central Committee. The Chinese National Liberation Action Committee published 'Action against War' in Wuhan, and Qiu zhe actively supported. May, Qiu zhe went to Hong Kong to unite people from all walks of life in Hong Kong against Japan. In the autumn of the same year, Qiu zhe and Zhang Bojun and Peng Zemin founded the 'Advance Daily' in Guangzhou. They intend to report on the battlefields and publish anti-war statements. However, on the eve of publication, Guangzhou fell short of publication. \\nSince October 1938, after the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, the War of Resistance against Japan moved to the holding stage. The KMT government passively resisted Japan and actively opposed the Communist Party, launched three times an anti-Communist climax, and adopted a policy of eliminating dissent against other anti-Japanese democratic forces other than the Communist Party. They exerted pressure on the Chinese National Liberation Action Committee in an attempt to cancel its organization and cease its activities. The Chinese National Liberation Action Committee did not succumb to the pressure of the KMT. Major leaders, including Qiu zhe, agreed that the CPC is a true anti-Japanese force and is the only friend that can be trusted and relied on. \\nFor a long time, Qiu zhe has had close ties with the Chinese Communist Party members underground. He used his apartment in Shanghai to cover the communists and managed to deliver secret documents for them. While working underground in Shanghai, Zeng Xianshih (later Mrs. Ye Shuai), lived in Qiu zhe for more than a year, often working until late at night. Qiu zhe and his family actively cooperated with her work. In addition to letting people living at home to go out and distribute leaflets, Qiu Che also let the Eldest Hill Charter and her daughter Qiu Xuemei go to school, filled with leaflets in a school bag and distribute them around. Wen Jiangong, an underground party member of the Communist Party of China, suffers from lung disease and weakness. After being arrested in jail, Mrs. Qiu zhe sent medicine and beef juice and cod liver oil to jail once a week, bringing him back to health gradually. At the same time, every effort is made to rescue it so that it can be free and return to the front line. \\nIn the summer of 1939, Qiu zhe went to Chongqing, to the country difficult. Chen Cheng set up a family reception, persuaded Qiu Che to give up the 'third party' and walk with Chiang Kai-shek, Qiu Che categorically refused. \\nDuring the anti-Japanese war, Qiu zhe and Ye Jianying, representative of the Chinese Communist Party in Chongqing, frequently exchanged Once Qiu Che talked about his son-in-law Ng Kai Wai's first speed printing machine, can be typed with wax paper, transcription hand immediately printed into text. After listening to Ye Jianying thinks that the liberated area is very in need of this kind of equipment, hoping to see. Qiu zhe immediately wrote to let son-in-law come to Chongqing with speed printing machine. Ye Jianying wrote 'self-reliant' on the spot four words, Wu Qihui immediately printed, Ye Jianying was very satisfied, immediately order 10, agreed to transfer the liberated zone by Ningbo.

After liberation, Ye Shuai ruled South China, often went to Qiu zhe's family as a guest, talking about state affairs, Ye Shuai gave poetry 'Qiu Laojia Feast in Guangzhou':\\nSnake soup fish win the bass, Yuexiu mountain front not alone. Slipped to the new tone, make homesteem multiplication division. \\nAfter Qiu zhe died, Ye Shuai went to Guangzhou, still please Mrs. Qiu to meet the apartment, so friendship is deep, visible here. This is blood clotting friendship! \\nDuring the anti-Japanese war, the prestige of Qiu Che, Chiang Kai-shek, Chen Cheng Chang Si Lo, and persuade, but Qiu zhe was in a spirit. Chen Cheng asked Qiu Che to be the director of the youth department, and preached Chiang Kai-shek, to write a book on how to train young people. Written, after reading Chiang Kai-shek, a croner said that Qiu zhe hung sheep head selling dog meat, superficially supported Chairman Jiang, and his bones were anti-Jiang. After learning about the incident, Chiang Kai-shek said that this person must not use it later. \\nAt the end of 1939, the intransigent KMT disrupted the anti-Japanese National United Front, causing great dissatisfaction and disappointment among the various parties with Jiang's resistance to Japan. The persistence of one-party dictatorship and the elimination of dissent by the intransigent parties posed a serious threat to the survival of defenseless anti-Japanese parties. Under this situation, the anti-Japanese parties have demanded that the KMT end one-party dictatorship, adopt a democratic constitution, and to unite together to fight against the intransigent KMT. Senators from the Communist Party of China, the China Al-Shabaab, the National Socialist Party, the National Liberation Action Committee, the National Rescue Federation, the China Vocational Education Society, the Rural Construction Association and some of the society's senators, who participated in the fourth session of the National Committee of the Kuomintang, have achieved great strife. Victory and deeply appreciate that the victory of this struggle is the result of a coalition of the parties; if there is no joint , if a democratic constitution is to be truly implemented in China, it is impossible to insist on unity against Japan. Therefore, party leaders advocating anti-Japanese resistance and part of society Xianda initiated the 'Unification of Comrades to Build a Nation' in Chongqing. On November 23, 1939, the founding meeting was held in Chongqing YMCA, Zhang Bojun and Qiu zhe represented the Chinese National Liberation Action Committee. \\nQiu zhe has participated in various political and social activities on behalf of the Chinese National Liberation Action Committee on several occasions, promoting solidarity against Japan. The KMT passively resisted Japan, actively opposed the Communist Party, and adopted a policy of eliminating dissent against other anti-Japanese democratic forces. Pressure was exerted on the Liberation Action Commission in an attempt to abolish its organization and cease its activities. The Chinese National Liberation Action Committee did not succumb to the pressure of the KMT. Major leaders, including Qiu zhe, agreed that the CPC is a true anti-Japanese force and is the only friend that can be trusted and relied on. \\nOn January 6, 1941, Chiang Kai-shek blatantly created the 'Wannan Incident' that shocked China and abroad. Qiu zhe hated the crime of killing the new four armies by the KMT reactionaries, undermining the crimes of unity against Japan, giving 'Feelings-Went Incident in Chongqing in Anhui Province' denounced the KMT's stubborn\\nHu dust boiling fans, embrace the car Shu road line. Deer horse on the tinghugh refers to, the same room is still horizontal. \\nThe lou lost books sigh, sit alone frequently pour wine. Wind and rain Changchun water, dream soul around the river sound. \\nThe First League pointed out that the enemy Kou had moved up the Yangtze River, but the KMT did not resist its enemy, but retracted the army back to Sichuan, Chiang Kai-shek hiding to Emei Mountain; the Union rebuked the KMT for referring to the deer as a horse, reversing black and white, working with the same room; the conjugal couplets, the In fact, Qiu zhe was not just 'scrapped books' and 'pouring wine'. He also worked closely with the Chinese Communist Party to expose the KMT's crime of undermining unity against Japan. \\nIn mid-January 1941, Qiu zhe and Zhang Bojun, on behalf of the Chinese National Liberation Action Committee, held formal talks with Chinese Communist Party leaders Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu and Ye Jianying in Chongqing on the 50th in Zengjiayan, Chongqing, and expressed their sincerity for cooperation and asked the CPC to support the program and group of the Committee for Liberation Action Weaving and propaganda, as well as economic assistance. Zhou Enlai and others expressed 'extreme agreement' and promised 'to give all kinds of support.' This has further strengthened cooperation between the Chinese National Liberation Action Committee and the Communist Party of China. \\nAfter the incident in South Anhui, relations between the two parties were very tense and faced with the crisis of reopening the civil war. The parties were deeply disappointed with the KMT and expressed deep sympathy for the position taken by the Communist Party of China. Qiu zhe and others, under the guidance of Zhou Enlai, advised all parties to organize a political alliance of a third party nature. Following consultations, it was decided to work together to build a coalition of democratic political groups on the basis of the United Comrade on the Establishment of the Nation. The aim is to 'unite the central parties, one resist Chiang Kai-shek's blows and cooperate with the Communist Party'. On March 19, 1941, the confederation of the Chinese Democratic Political Party was held in Chongqing Shangqing Temple Special Garden, Qiu zhe was one of the 13 founders. In this way, China's Democratic League, including the China Al-Shabaab, the National Socialist Party, the Chinese National Liberation Action Committee, the China Vocational Education Society, the Rural Construction Association and the Social Xianda, were officially established secretly in Chongqing. Qiu zhe was elected a member of the 13-member Central Executive Committee. He regularly attended various symposia, organized activities and discussed important issues. \\nQiu zhe returned to Hong Kong for democratic patriotism after attending the founding meeting of the Chinese Democratic Political League in Chongqing, participated in the preparation of the Guangming Daily, and briefed the progressing people in Hong Kong on the situation in Chongqing, including the establishment of the NLD. On 10 October of the same year, Hong Kong's Guangming Daily published a declaration on the founding of the NLD and the 'Ten Political Agenda'. \\nIn November, Qiu Zefu '10th Anniversary of the Martyrdom of Comrade Selection':\\nBut remember the age of wartime, will long be ambitious. Yuetai horse test people, Hanshui Yanghuishi Zhenqi. \\nWant to bow to the kingdom, and know the loss of whip. Hunting world hero language, ten years home pay with whom? \\nSecond:\\nLooking back on the divine state, every mercy time hardship. Lu Shen spilled new tears, often jasper coffin. \\nMelancholy friends generate wide, low hovering old few withered residues. The people do not empty vision, big wave bay shines cold. \\nAt that time, Japanese imperialism launched the Pacific War and Hong Kong fell. Qiu zhe was hidden and engaged in underground revolutionary activities with Peng Zemin and others. They solicit donations for the new four armed forces, buy military supplies, and often rush around the clock. Wooden boats have been organized to transport salt from the Mainland to Hong Kong, selling salt to buy medicines and return to Dongjiang anti-Japanese guerrillas. On the one hand, liaise with the Mainland to deliver goods for the revolutionary bases; on the other hand, share information and understand domestic developments. \\nDuring the fall of Hong Kong, Peng Zemin was arrested twice by the Japanese gendarmerie and jailed. At that time, Peng Lao was already a man in his 60s. Over a month of interrogation, tortured and hungry, destroyed the body was puffy and dying. Under extremely difficult circumstances, Qiu Che helped Mrs. Peng find a Japanese friend to release Peng from prison on bail. \\nIn June 1943, the Chinese National Liberation Action Committee invited Zhou Enlai to meet with Comrade in Chongqing in Mid-Levels Xincun. Mid-Levels Village is located on a plum dam on the banks of the Jialing River. The road to the mountainside also has to climb dozens of stone steps, and then wear a trail to reach. Because the situation is grim, the secret service, deliberately choose this secluded place, and choose at 9 pm to start. Qiu zhe attended the meeting. After analyzing China's situation, Zhou Enlai said that striving for democracy and unity against Japan are the main tasks at present. The democratic movement, of course, requires the participation of the masses of the people, and to have a common goal, that is, 'war of solidarity and resistance.' The coalition of democratic groups can play a catalytic role in the anti-Japanese democratic movement at the present time. At a time of national distress, non-unity cannot resist war, non-democracy cannot unite, strive for democracy, and war of solidarity is the common cause of all of us. 'Talking with Jun and reading ten years', Zhou Enlai's words are revelations in the political direction. Qiu zhe has learned deeply, like 'going from the rugged trail to Kangzhuang Avenue', and has strengthened the confidence in cooperation with the Communist Party of China. \\nOn September 19, 1944, the Chinese Democratic League held a national congress in Chongqing Special Park, and decided to change the 'China Democratic League' to 'China Democratic League' and to include non-party persons to join the alliance in their personal capacity. Qiu zhe was elected Central Committee member of the NLD. After the meeting, the NLD Central Committee instructed Qiu zhe and Li Zhangda to prepare for the establishment of the Southern NLD local organization In October of the same year, a meeting of Southeast cadres of the China Democratic League was held in Meixian. Qiu zhe is deputy chairman of the Southeast Branch of the China Democratic League. \\nIn 1944, the Elder Ziqiu Charter died in anti-Japanese frontline Qianjiang disease. The sad news came, Qiu zhe wrote down the 'Charter of the Cry Big'. There are only two ancient poems, this is one of them, even such a space, I am afraid that his middle-aged death grief is not tolerated:\\nIn the previous year, mercy to his mother, he died. New mourning past mistakes stacked, midnight around the room wandering. \\nMy son is small that smart, exchange mutual reputation is unique. Three years with her mother to return home, mixed blood yuan than the king. \\nWeak crown again to Fuso, the highest school said talented. For the old father does not leave the side, and talk about the country. \\nBroadcast Huhan re-enter Shu, thousands of mountains and water with work. ...\\nOld tears cross like death, revelation. ...\\nChildhood is not more than ever, doing things are too late. Suingde Japanese, verbal and hard. \\nThe article revealed its hatred, mourning feelings of enemy. ...\\nRiver rolling east, hero to find grief. \\nQiu zhe tasted not to love his son, and he was at the forefront of the national trouble. He resolutely sent his son to the front line against Japan, without revisiting. His son died for the nation, and he buried his memory into the heart and worked harder. \\n'The earth's bright day civilians wish reward'\\nIn the fall of 1945, the War of Resistance against Japan won In December, with the support of the Southern Party of the Communist Party of China, Qiu zhe served as deputy chairman in Hong Kong with Li Zhangda and Peng Zemin's Southern Branch of the China Democratic League. \\nAt the end of 1945, Qiu zhe received a handwritten letter from Zhou Enlai to him and Li Zhangda, calling for speeding up the movement of democracy in the South. In January 1946, nine branches of NLD Port were established. At that time, the KMT reactionaries, with the support of the United States Emperor, intensified their anti-Communist opposition to the people and were ready to fight civil war. The Southern Branch of the NLD actively strives for anti-Jiang forces among the middle classes and classes, uniting intellectuals and KMT military and political personnel, striving for peace and democracy, opposing civil war, and upholding the idea of forming a coalition government proposed by the Communist Party. \\nIn order to better unite intellectuals and anti-Jiang forces among the KMT military and political personnel, strive for peace and democracy, oppose the civil war, and support the proposal of the Communist Party of China to organize a coalition government. With the active support of the CCO in Hong Kong, the People's Daily, which was founded by Qiu zhe, was published in Hong Kong on 1 March 1946. 'stand in the position of Chinese agro-industrial and civilian population, in order to completely complete the Chinese nation 'We strive for democratic politics and the future of socialism.' Qiu zhe is the chairman and issuer of People's Daily. In an effort to make the People's Daily publicly available in Guangdong in order to strengthen the democratic forces in the National Unity District, Qiu zhe and Peng Zemin, with their status in society and political influence, wrote jointly to Zhang Fakui, director of Guangzhou operations at the time, saying: 'The People's Daily relocated to Guangzhou and published in Guangzhou, whose purpose is to oppose the civil war. Taking democracy and forming a coalition government, our party (the third party), has the responsibility to urge the KMT to comply with the CPPCC resolution. With the power of local officials, you give the People's Daily all kinds of facilities and are more responsible for protecting the People's Daily from spoilage by opponents.' Zhang Fakui, secretary-general of the trust, Mai Chao, who had participated in the A&M Party. The People's Daily was soon approved for publication in Guangzhou. On April 1, the People's Daily moved to Guangzhou. The People's Daily reported and commented on the domestic political struggle at that time, denounced the KMT's civil war policy and played an active role in propagating against Chiang Kai-shek's civil war, opposing dictatorship, fighting for democracy and forming a coalition government. Zhou Enlai praised it as a 'friend of the people' and Dong Biwu praised it as the 'Voice of the People'. The newspaper was seized twice by the KMT. \\nOn June 5, 1946, Guangzhou Municipal Police Department, Guangdong Security Command, etc., suddenly dispatched a large number of police officers, loaded live ammunition, searched the city's democratic newspapers and more than ten bookstores, among them the People's Daily. Qiu zhe and other South chief officials sent a message on June 9 to Chiang Kai-shek and Executive Chairman Song Ziwen, Chief Executive of the CPPCC Conference, Zhang Fakui, Director of Guangzhou Operations, and Luo Zhuoying, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, expressing strong protest over this outrage that blatantly violates the legitimate rights and interests of the people, and calls for a speedy end to the Guangzhou State. Atrocities by DPP authorities. In August, after the People's Newspaper was closed for the second time, Qiu zhe did not fear the rape and personally intervened from Hong Kong to Guangzhou to protest against the shameless behavior of the KMT reactionaries in violation of the CPPCC resolution, and made a fruitless intervention and went out with outrage. \\nQiu Che is in close contact with patriotic democrats at home and abroad in Hong Kong and abroad. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, Qiu Che has engaged in anti-civil war activities and continued his struggle to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's regime. He writes articles, holds press conferences, publishes declarations, etc. In addition to serving as deputy chairman of the Southern Head Office of the NLD, he also served as the central member and Secretary-General of the Action Committee. \\n1946 (7? (To be found), At the beginning of the year, Chiang Kai-shek torn the CPPCC resolution unilaterally, the NLD was declared illegal. Many patriotic chiefs, including Li Gong-pak and more smelling, were assassinated by KMT agents. The situation was reversed, and many NLD leaders, democrats, progress professors and students had taken refuge in Hong Kong. The minds of democrats and intellectuals in Hong Kong and Guangdong are rather chaotic, and political forces outside the Communist Party have been further divided. In May, Qiu zhe wrote to Zhou Enlai in Nanjing, taking up the situation of the Southern Democratic Party, the situation of patriots and his own views on the situation. August 5th, received a reply from Zhou Enlai:\\n'Mr. Ying Fu Road right: holding reading Hui book, pay attention to one, all promised free, no pleasure. The current situation is as good as it has been shown, the civil war is expanding, and negotiations are on track. Peace persists and depends on the concerted efforts of all parties. Our Party remains the consistent policy of peace, democracy and independence, and continues to struggle and vowed to serve as the backing of all parties. Mr. and other southern struggles, have been over the years, after not trying to win even more oppression. Looking forward to the south day, miss, this cloth Fu, praise the public Qi! ...'\\nThe letter points the right direction to the people who feel little about their future, and it is a great encouragement and support for Qiu zhe and other patriots who insist on a peaceful democratic struggle in South China. \\nIn October 1946, on the eve of the Guangzhou People's Newspaper was closed, some leaders of the A&M Party saw domestic professors coming to Hong Kong. At the same time, Nanyang political turmoil, many students and young students came to Hong Kong and were anxious to study. Many famous scholars gathered in Hong Kong. Talents are high, and it is easier to hire professors. Qiu zhe and Peng Zemin and Yang Yitang have initiated the preparation of the Academy to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and train and send talents for the establishment of a new China. Qiu zhe has always attached great importance to the cause of culture and education. He had funded his own 'Hushan Primary School' to help children of farmers in his village to attend school. He also actively supported Songguchi Secondary School as a director of the school; and then built the Songguchi Library. He often said that the rise and fall of a country depends on the level of culture and education in that country, the level of civilization of its people, and whether intellectuals can be reused. The decision to organize the college was supported by the leaders of the Communist Party in Hong Kong and the assistance of all parties. Che Qiu served as head of the Preparatory Committee Qiu zhe made every effort to raise funds. Choi Ting-kai rented his house at Castle Peak Road, Kowloon. Dong Biwu personally introduced his own house from Shanghai and processed the case procedure. After the preparation is ready, the school was named 'Dade College' by Chu Che. It takes the 'Theory' 'to stand up and stand up,' and to commemorate the revolutionary character of Deng Yanda. Qiu zhe is chairman, Yang Yitang is the director of the school, hired famous democracy professors such as Qianjiaju, Huang Yumien, Huang Bozan and other teaching. With three departments of politics, economics and literature, the Academy continues to nurture democratic forces and has produced and channeled a large number of talented people to the movement of democratic revolutions in the South. Later, Qiu zhe wanted to work in Shanghai, and could not serve as a collegiate affair. In consultation with the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong, he left Dade College to the management of the various democratic parties, with Li Jishen serving as chairman of the board. From the autumn of 1946 to the spring of 1949, Dade College enrolled more than 600 young students. Most students completed their studies and went to the liberated areas, contributing to the liberation of the Chinese people. \\nAt the end of 1946, Qiu zhe returned from Hong Kong to Shanghai in preparation for the convening of the Second Plenary Session of the NLD and the Fourth Conference of the Agricultural and Labour Party. At that time, the leaders of the A&M Party often entered and out of the Qiu House, attracted the attention of the reactionaries. They often came to the Qiu family to spy on their account. Qiu Che has been prepared to play playing cards as cover. Members of the Communist Party of China often come in touch and bring news of the victory of the Liberation Army Day, inspiring. Qiu zhe allowed son-in-law to free up a room in Daming Industrial Factory to print these messages and go out to distribute. \\nIn February 1947, the Chinese National Liberation Action Committee held its fourth cadre meeting, which was preceded by a ten-day preparatory meeting. There was a heated debate on the name of the party and the future route. Regarding the name of the party, representatives believe that after the victory of the resistance, the country has been transformed into a democratic revolution, and the name of the party should be changed accordingly, and have proposed more than ten names such as the 'Industrial and Peasant Democratic Party', 'Democratic Party of China', 'Democratic Party of China' and 'Socialist Democratic Party', but it is difficult to determine which specific changes to it. Ask Zhou Enlai, and I hope he will make some comments. Zhou Enlai was humble and did not answer immediately. It is just to say that this is an important issue, and it is best to discuss and decide in depth within the party. On the other hand, Zhou En said: 'According to my personal opinion, it would be appropriate to change the name of the Industrial and Peasant Democratic Party to be changed slightly to the A&M Democratic Party, because Mr. Deng Dianda attached great importance to the Chinese peasants issue. He was still in the north, he was one of the advocates of the Chinese peasant liberation movement. He was one of the advocates of the Chinese peasant liberation movement. The idea of 'building agro-labore-centered civilian polities' has been raised on many occasions in his other papers , Isn't it logical to 'establish' a civilian agro-industrial regime that is the core of Mr. Deng Yanda's political ideology, is the glorious historical tradition of your party. Is it not logical to use the 'A&M Democratic Party 'as your new party name?' He also declared that this is his personal opinion as a friend, how to change, or whether we should let everyone discuss, let everyone decide. After repeated consultations, the delegates accepted the proposal and changed the name of the Party to China's A&M Democratic Party. Qiu zhe attended the second plenary session of the Chinese Democratic League and the fourth National Cadre Conference of the Agricultural and Labour Party held in Shanghai. \\nIn October of the same year, the KMT persecuted democratic forces. The central organ of the Agricultural and Labour Party moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong, and the Party's activities went underground. Qiu zhe stayed behind in Shanghai, set up a secret central office and served as the head of the 'Shanghai Office' of the A&M Central Committee, leading the Party's underground struggle. Instead of being intimidated by unusually serious white terror, he was full of confidence and hope in a bright China. This can be seen from his poem with Liu Yazi, 'Songer presents Mr. Liu Yazi from Hong Kong, the second original rhyme':\\nSiu Shu Garden Trail is delayed, just when cold and cold. The first cang pine proud bone, eyes weeping willow new gesture. \\nShould know city Ji finally gallop, do not believe the city for a long time The road is rugged and heavy, divided between women and men. \\nLiuya Zi original work is:\\nJiangnan flower base drunk hill late, happy when Jintuan weak. Desperate to his father, the hardest blue eye is delicate. \\nCar dust Martingale hand and tuck, tea and play play host. Zhu Ru Tianqu Teng Chanjian, from the Qi female victory boy. \\nIn autumn 1947, the Hong Kong underground organization of the Communist Party of China for Peng Ze Laozhou, organized a political gathering to unite democratic people from all walks of life. Qiu zhe gave the poem 'Giving Mr. Peng Zemin':\\nNine transposed thousands of people living together, all beings and diseases are hard to Fifty years of hard work, Peng Peng Changjian a light bag. \\nThe ancient kingdom is not except, the blue bird in the bag may be imaginary. Between the point of exorcism, when winning a volume of books. \\nHe showed his patriotism of worried people. \\nOn May 1, 1948, the Chinese Communist Party issued a slogan to prepare for the convening of a new CPPCC meeting, which received a response from all parties and non-party personalities. Qiu zhe returned to Hong Kong during this period and actively participated in the preparations for the new CPPCC. On August 1, Mao Zedong fueled the democratic parties and non-partisan democrats in Hong Kong: 'On May 5, it was revealed that because of traffic blockages, it is beginning to learn.' 'Mr. Zhu endorses our party's call for May 1 and is extremely admired.' 'On the timing, location, who to convene the meeting, the scope of participation and the issues discussed at the meeting, we hope that Mr. Zhu and people from all walks of life across the country will discuss together, with insight.' According to Chairman Mao's call back, Qiu zhe, as one of the leaders of the Party of Agriculture and Labour, participated in discussions on the issue of convening a meeting of the CPPCC, and put forward comments and suggestions. \\nIn order to strengthen the united war work and close contact with outsiders, the Hong Kong branch of the Chinese Communist Party established a United Front War Committee. Members of the United Front War Committee, who were both NLD and the leader of the A&M Party, recorded his first meeting with Qiu zhe:\\n'Remember the first meeting with the Old Hill in his house at Seymour Road. Qiu zhe was thin, early 60, but because of the tall, good maintenance, ruddy face, bright, plus lip left a pinch of white 'Chaplin' beard, make me this young man very natural to take a certain distance attitude towards this living elder. It's probably my cautious attitude to his old man, and he showed extra affinity that made me calm down. In particular, my two greetings led him to recognize my Cantonese language with Hakka language, and asked me if I was a guest. When I said that my ancestors lived in Jiaying, he not only said they were 'family members', but also closer to the talks. When I spoke about what the party organization asked me to convey to him, I noticed that he listened seriously to every sentence he said to me, and that the organization asked for his opinion, he answered him quickly and straightforward, without turning and ambiguity; he showed his leadership of our Party Central Committee, in particular It is respect and love for Chairman Mao. After business, we will talk about state affairs and world affairs. I personally learned during this meeting that he is an elderly man who unconditionally agrees with our party's ideas, respects our party, and is also widely known and has a considerable depth of opinion.' \\nDuring the liberation war, the head of the Communist Party in Hong Kong invited the leaders of the Democratic Party to hold a two-week symposium. The name 'biweekly symposium' is a way of negotiating countries at the middle and upper levels of democracy of the Party of the CPC. In general, the head of the Hong Kong Branch of the Communist Party of China reports on the situation at home and abroad, especially the domestic war situation, research work and raise awareness of ideas. The forum was mostly located in Qiu zhe family. After the establishment of the United Front War Commission, many of them were held at the seat of the United Front Commission. Qiu zhe and Peng Zemin represented the NLD and the A&M Party participated in these symposiums. The CPC attended the meeting by Fang Fang, Pan Hannian and Coherent. Qiu zhe's speech is mostly a synthesis of the views of everyone, presented in a consultative manner, often concise, and rarely lengthy. He wholeheartedly supported the proposal of the CPC Central Committee and supported it with practical action. \\nIn the autumn, the CPC Central Committee decided to escort non-party democrats in Hong Kong to the Northeast, then transferred to the North China Liberation Zone to further prepare for the meeting of the New Political Consultative Party Association. Qiu zhe was scheduled to leave Hong Kong for a second batch. His decades-long goal is about to be achieved, and Qiu zhe is excited. In order not to attract the attention of Hong Kong and British and Jiang Bang agents, the Chinese Communist Party staff sent their luggage to the ship first. On the night of November 23, 1948, 2-3 hours before sailing, several dozen people such as Qiu zhe, Guo Moruo, Masulun, Lu Xun, Chen Geyou, Sha Qianli, Shaqian Li and Hubozan were on board. This voyage is very special, to take a certain risk. What is most worried about is not natural disasters-the risk of sailing at sea, but man-made disasters. At that time, the battle of Liao Shen only ended, Beiping and Tianjin were not liberated. War clouds are covered, ships need to pass through the Taiwan Strait, while the coast is controlled by the United States Jiang Hai and the Air Force. \\nFor safety, Qiu zhe and others aboard the 'Central China' cruise with the Norwegian flag, the head of the United War Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Hong Kong Branch and the China Resources Company Wang Watson escorted with the boat. \\nOn the night, Qiu zhe made 'leave your friends and relatives'\\nWilling to hold a clear reward friend, fight will live and die for the upheaval Guanshan is very fast, the sword box has a long ring whip. \\nThinking of the establishment of a new China, Qiu zhe's mood can not be calm for a long time, on the way to poetry:\\nThe earth is bright and the people wish reward;\\nThe agenda began, and the land reform said from scratch. \\nRoad next to the building room, a move of Shenzhou. \\nNovember 29, i"

'Central China' held a chic sea celebration, and Guo Moruo also performed the show. On the eve of Dalian landing, Qiu Zefu Shi:\\nHypocrisy and national thief, black flow poison all over the home. Jin Liao liberation new life, quoted long song ye drink tea. \\nShenyang, the last stronghold of the Kuomintang in the Northeast, was attacked, and the whole northeast became a liberated area. The Northeast Bureau of the Communist Party of China moved from Harbin to Shenyang, and democrats from Harbin also came to Shenyang. Qiu zhe and others went straight to Shenyang after landing in Dalian. Hong Kong's second batch of democrats successfully arrived in the liberated areas, causing even greater impact across the country. \\nQiu zhe and Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Tan Pingshan, Zhang Bojun and other 55 democrats who arrived in the liberated areas jointly issued 'Our Opinions on the Times' on January 22, 1949, stating: 'There is no room for reactionaries within the People's Democratic Front, and there is no room for reactionaries to stand on the so-called middle route. 'Existence', expressing 'complete support' by Chairman Mao Zedong on behalf of the CPC Central Committee The eight conditions for peace are proposed, and the people of the country will take action 'to promote their full realization'. \\n1949 New Year's Eve, Qiu zhe 'New Year's Eve Banquet, Mr. Xu Baoju Yun':\\nLight full of neon red scene new, yangko twist. Tu Su Zuuri was disabled, Ming Dan welcomed the victory year. \\nIn February 1949, Qiu zhe went to Beiping from Shenyang to attend the preparatory meeting of the National Committee of the CPPCC as a representative of the Chinese Democratic League. Because of his hard work, his blood pressure suddenly increased to 230 and had to be hospitalized for treatment. He felt his life was in danger at all times, writing his will. In his will to his daughter, he reviewed his life experience, engaged in democratic revolutionary activities, personal humiliation, supported the leadership of the Communist Party, supported the United Front, and asked her daughter to do his best for socialism. Guo Moruo news, write poetry consolation:\\nExcessive blood pressure is afraid, Jun shrinkage is strong. Agro-industrial democracy division, program consultation set duroom. \\nGood wound, widow beds. Freshmen for a new world, but people are safe and self-reliant. \\nAnd conferred 'blood pressure line-and then solace':\\nJun bitter blood pressure is high, I have low blood pressure. \\nHigh and low overhang, Baidu is odd. \\nI want to see the heart and worry about the people, and I am unhappy. \\nPlease go to sleep, too much thought. \\nDedicate to three counter-efforts, together good time. \\nJun not see long shin, short shins, elders do not have to break, short do not have to show. \\nOne thing to listen to its nature, the people cannot be liberated. \\nUnder the careful treatment of doctors, Qiu Che finally turned to security. \\nIn September, Qiu zhe attended the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and participated in the development of the Common Programme and the creation of the People's Republic of China. \\nIn November, the Party of Agriculture and Labour convened the Fifth National Conference of Cadres in Beijing. At the beginning of the meeting, some delegates suggested that the A&M Party should be 'honorably' ended, on the grounds that the Party's historical task had been completed. Under the conditions of the proletarian dictatorship, there could be only one Communist Party, and no multiple parties could coexist. This view, though small, was weighty, and at the time it was the so-called 'proposition of progress'. Most people, including Qiu zhe, have a lot of feelings for the A&M Party and are unwilling to abolish the organization, but they do not dare to struggle according to reason, many people passively await the final decision, and their thoughts are very confusing. After the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee understood, Premier Zhou Enlai invited the leadership of the A&M Party to talk. Qiu zhe participated in the discussion. Zhou Enlai held an initial exchange of views on the future, tasks and role of the A&M leadership. After the reunification of his ideas, he also invited all representatives to speak. Compared with the history of the CPC, he was positive, criticized, encouraged, and encouraged. He said that the A&M, a political party with a history of revolutionary history, had struggled relentlessly during the difficult times of the revolution. In my opinion, the A&M Democratic Party is not the time to come to an end. I think the A&M also has its historical task, and it cannot be left free. Delegates listened to their spirits. Zhou Enlai's report played a decisive role in the smooth holding of the five-kan meeting. The meeting decided, under the leadership of the Communist Party, to educate the whole party with Marxinism and Mao Zedong Thought, and to adopt the Common Programme as an action plan, and set the overall line of service to socialism. After the meeting, Qiu zhe returned to work in Guangdong from Beijing. \\nIn 1951, Ye Jianying went to Guangxi to inspect his work, and at a symposium meeting with outside the party, said Li Zhangda, Chen Rutang and Qiu zhe were all good friends of the Party and had done many good things for the Party. \\nAfter his founding, Qiu zhe was a member of the Zhongnan Military Commission, member of the Central South Administrative Committee, Director of Agriculture and Forestry Department of Guangdong Province, deputy mayor of Guangzhou, deputy governor of Guangdong Province and deputies of the National People's Congress. During his tenure, he wholeheartedly supported and implemented all the policies and policies of the Communist Party of China, contributed to the development of the local economy and made important contributions to the consolidation and expansion of the United Front. \\nIn 1957, Qiu Che was defined as a right-wing (closed to the outside world), and dismissed all his posts. At that time, he was old and sick, and this heavy blow, finally died on 5 January 1959, at the age of 74. \\nAfter the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Qiu zhe was mistaken as right-wing was corrected and political honor was restored. If Qiu zhe knows the underground, he will certainly help it in the difficult way to build a nation, as he said in his poem. \\nThis said according to 'Huang Qixiang biography'. I specifically verified with the author Wang Dalu that Wang Lao said Huang Qixiang himself said to him, so it adopted. But there is a contradiction with the Ji party's narrative of the 'night of the accident', and record it together here to be doubtful. Ji Fang, 'Remembering the life of Deng Yan Da's life': 'My residence is confidential and he (Chen Jingzhai), has also come. On the night of the accident, the patrol came to the door to catch me. Fortunately, they want money, they can buy and put it. But I had no money, but I had to borrow with them. I think that only Huang Qixiang may have a little money, just went to Huang's downstairs to shout his pseudonym. Huang Qixiang probably paid me 100-200 yuan, and finally let me get away. Later listening to Zhuang Mingyuan said, he came to see me that day, also called the patrol arrested, and also spent money to buy and put it. \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"

				"memoirContent": "【Attached】People's Daily: 'Qiu zhizhong Zhong Gan is willing to serve Zhangluo Union, employees of the Ministry of Industry unveiled his fake mask' (1957.8.12)\\n[People's Daily] The Ministry of Forest Industry, in the offensive of the right leader Lolongki and Zhao Wenbi, who coincided with Luo, attacked the next right-wing member who sang 'blackheads' for the Zhangluo Union. \\nQiu zhizhong Zhizhong is a member of the Party of Agricultural Workers and Workers Democratic Party, which has directly developed Zhang Bojun Last year, he was introduced by Lorongi, drilling into the Ministry of Forest Industry's Capital Construction Bureau, and worked as a chief engineer. As soon as he entered the Ministry of Forest Industry, he began to develop organizations and engage in political capital for the A&M Party. Zhang Bojun once told him: 'Forestry and Forestry are only one member of the Party (referring to the A&M Democratic Party), so the important issue is development organizations, I can give you special powers.' So Qiu zhizhong Zhizhong became arrogant. At the Ministry of Forest Industry, he used a solemn invitation and a wish to pull people into the A&M Party. \\nAfter the wind began, Qiu zhizhong Zhizhong thought that 'the opportunity came', he and Luolongki's 'great general' Zhao Wenbi, provoked disagreement among the cadres of the Ministry of Industry, and hit the leadership. He slandered the deputy director leading his Technical Audit Office 'is a carpenter, how can lead me'. In fact, he was conspiracy to usurp leadership. \\nAt the stage of the great enlargement, he once said to Zhao Wenbi: 'You often contact the party committee and have no convenience to speak. That makes me blackhead good.' So he fomented everywhere, saying, 'The three anti-counter, counterproductive mistakes are great, and even the side effects exceed the achievements.' He even viciously said: 'Five million intellectuals now have 3 million eaten the Communist Party's deficit.' He also actively supported the reactionary fallacy of Lorongi's 'Rebel Commission'. He once suggested to Zhao Wenbi, a right-wing activist: 'It is necessary to pull the technicians so that there is political power to avoid being slaughtered by people at will. Because party members don't understand technology, we first get technical leadership before we can control the Mori Ministry of Engineering.' Zhao Wenbi told him: 'Your things are all for you. The head of the department (referring to Luolongki), said that in the institutions is not sound, the rice has not been cooked must be patient, will be resolved in the future.' Zhao Wenbi also told him: 'You live in town is very convenient, you can go to representative characters walk, touch the climate, I'm not convenient, someone pays attention to me.' Qiu zhizhong Zhizhong immediately promised, 'willing to serve.' \\nUntil the anti-right struggle began, Qiu zhizhong Zhizhong was still active everywhere, running for the Zhangluo Alliance, and offered advice to Zhao Wenbi, 'Let Lorongji be stable. It is really not possible, you can not be Chinese, and take refuge in foreign embassies.' How is Qiu zhizhong Zhizhong a person? Before liberation, he was the president of a reactionary monthly 'Municipal Construction' magazine. After the People's Liberation Army liberated the Mingguang area near Nanjing in early 1949, Li Zongren, the KMT's reactionary party, used the tricks of fake peace talks. Qiu zhizhong Zhizhong, at the instigation of Li Zongren, served as the chief representative of the so-called 'People's Peace Delegation' and came to Beijing to pseudo peace and wanted to delay time to get a respite opportunity. At that time, I Beijing Military Control Council had discovered their fake masks and did not recognize them as objects of peace talks. But Qiu zhizhong Zhizhong, after liberation, risked to call 'peace talks work' and fool everywhere. And in the fall of 1950 organized 'China Urban Engineering Construction Company', bought short selling. When contracting State construction works, the State's assets have been deceived. Qiu zhizhong Zhizhong was a big tiger in the three and five counter-movements. \\nEmployees of the Mori Ministry of Industry have learned the vicious face of the hill of the right-wing elements singing 'blackheads' to Zhangluo Union, and are now concentrating fire on him to fight for rationale.

Life is more difficult, after the food was purchased there is little left, can only eat rice porridge, bead beans. For many years without oil meat, half a year did not eat meat, and mosquito bites at night. In September, returned to school, working in the right-wing student labor force under the Ministry of Production: to cover all the heavy physical labor of the college, such as planting land, dung, pig feeding, food transport, coal, pulling, digging foundation, stone lifting, sewer, transport of timber, ore, waste iron, steelmaking, etc. Sometimes to attend rescue, emergency relief, such as jumping Jialing River to salvage the driftwood, to Beibei Su Steel Factory swirl iron ore from the cliff cliffs, to the magnetic mouth to carry scrap iron, to the people's commune 'war three autumn' and so on. Heavy labor, long hours, heavy labor, and right-wing elements become a labor force that can be at the discretion of any powerful. But the relief fee is only $1 per person per month. Evening political study; weekly democratic life meeting, everyone reviews and exposes each other. Monthly one thought summary, half a year summary.

In addition, most of the other right-wing parties have 'rhetoric' that is, in response to the party's call to 'make a big bang', give opinions to the Party and say something. I'm all not. The experience of things and the original commission among them is this:\\nMy passion for painting has always changed, before and after liberation, my painting level has reached the highest level in my life, has had a considerable impact in the national painting industry. In the first few years of liberation, there was still some space for the development of culture and art, and my painting career was moving forward. For example, between 1951 and 1952, the Ministry of Culture also held a Chinese painting exhibition at the Bei Lan Hall in Beihai Park, and I presented four of my most delightful works to exhibit. After the exhibition, the paintings were not sent back to the author, equating to the 'acquisition' by the Ministry of Culture, which was said to have been sold to the Japanese at the time of the 'Cultural Revolution' by anybody. After the Cultural Revolution, and was constantly bought back by the Chinese people, one is my most intentional work. After being bought back, I also found me, let me inscribe, looking at such a beloved piece at no cost to others's collectibles, I really have some regret in my heart, but I still gave him questions. When the career was relatively smooth, the mood was naturally pleasant, and I had a good relationship with many of my friends at the time. \\nLater, the painting community was preparing to set up a national professional organization, the Chinese Academy of Painting. To organize such an authoritative and influential organization, it must be presented by a person recognized by everyone. Many people think of the famous scholar and painter Mr. Ye Gongchi. The matter was supported by Prime Minister Zhou Enlai. Mr. Yip Kong-chik lived in Hong Kong. Premier Zhou wrote to him personally inviting him to come back and preside over the matter. Mr. Ye was moved by Prime Minister Zhou's trust and graciously accepted. After coming back, naturally became the most popular candidate for the Dean of the Academy. Mr. Ye is President Chen's old friend, and I naturally know him very well, and some private relations. If when my mother died, I went to a shop in Nancheng to buy a package for my mother, passed through Rong Baozhai, met Mr. Ye, he looked at me very sad, asked me what happened, I told him about my unfortunate life and the hardship of our orphan and widow mother. He comforted me, 'I am also an orphan.' I have been very touched by the tears while saying that I have been so far. Also as he introduced me to others once boasted: 'Noble Tianhuang after often out some smart talents.' So thanks to his trust, some things were given to me. For example, I went to Shanghai to examine the relevant situation and experience of the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts in order to better organize the Chinese Academy. For this reason, I really went to Shanghai to carry out detailed research and research and have gained a lot of experience. So, in the eyes of others, I naturally became Mr. Ye's red man. But this has caused some resentment. At that time there was a gentleman in the art world. He was inside the party and had certain power. Of course he did not want Mr. Ye to come back to preside over the painting institute, knowing that Mr. Ye enjoys a high reputation in the art world. Once he returns, everyone will definitely stand on his side, and his power will certainly be greatly hurt; and To preserve his position, Mr. Ye must be brought down by this anti-right movement. In the eyes of this gentleman, I belong to Mr. Ye's death party, so to bring down Mr. Ye must bring down me together, and by knocking down the people around Mr. Ye in order to finally defeat him. So I became an inevitable victim. But beating a person into the right will always find some reason and excuses, but anyone who knows a little about me knows that I will not give any opinion at the so-called meeting to give opinions to the party, let alone give opinions to the party, that is to my friends, I will not give any opinion. But how to find excuses? It is right after the test of a thousand hammers: 'If you want to add sin, why suffer no words'? After collecting and excavating, I finally found a crime: I praised the painter Xu Yansun's painting with personality style, and quoted the verse 'Spring is full of garden, a red apricot coming out of the wall' to describe that praise the style he represents will have new hopes in the new era. So, according to this sentence, they said that I was unhappy with the great good situation at the time, and wanted to leave the party leadership and engage in a great individualism. The criticism at that time was held in the auditorium of the Ministry of Culture in Chaoyangmen. After that meeting, I was officially beaten as the right. Mr. Ye Gongchuk, and Mr. Xu Yansun, whom I praised, of course, were also beaten as the right in accordance with the established guidelines, which can be described as a network. As for the specific history and reasons for the two of them to form the right, I do not know very well, but I am indeed the gentleman personally asked and handled it personally. Of course, after the victory of the sport, his position in the art world was more popular, exhilarating. \\nI can't remember what year it was, about a year or two, and my right hat was removed again. The reason I can't remember is because there was no very clear and solemn procedure officially announcing this matter, and it was worn in the painting school at the time. At the University, the Master University was also unclear what was going on. Anyway, I was sparsely put on the right-wing hat, and I was stripped out of the hat. At that time, the policy stated that some hat-picking people were not called the current right-wing, but 'hat-picking right'-in fact, another form of right. Although I do not have this official name, but the masses who belong to the official 'hat-picking right' and who does not belong to the 'hat-picking right'? At that time, there was a very classic phrase for 'hats right', called 'hat in the hands of the masses'-not honest at any time you can wear it again. I know this very well, and it becomes spoken for a long time. For example, winter out to find a hat to wear, if found someone else to hold for me, I will immediately blow out: 'the hat in the hands of the masses'; if they take the hat, immediately blow out: 'the hat in their own hands'. No matter who's in his hand, anyway, there is a danger of being tied again, can it be better to do thin ice, such as the abyss, trembling? For a long time, people familiar with me know this allusion, winter before going out, all ask: 'Who's the hat in the hands?' Or I answered myself, 'Take the hat in my own hands.' Or others answered, 'Hats are in the hands of the masses.' \\nSome people often ask me: 'You are so honest, there is no speech, no dissatisfaction, actually beaten as the right, feel wrong not to be wronged?' To be honest, although I know the taste of being the right, I do not have the idea of being particularly wronged. I am different from some people, they may have had a glorious 'history of revolution'. They thought they were 'revolutionaries', and stood on the stand of revolutionary or positive demand for progress, responding to the party's call for advice and advice. Many people wanted to 'Fushun', once added Of course, they couldn't figure out the charge of 'resting the scale'. But I know that my situation is different from them. At that time, my old companion also often crying sad about this matter, I condoned her like this: 'Well, we can't talk about wrongs. We are feudal legacy. You think, the bourgeois are going to revolutionize our lives, let alone the proletariat of the bourgeois life. Now the revolution needs to catch a part of the right, not to catch us who? Can we be a 'left'? If it's not the 'left', is it not the right? Fortunately, mothers have just died, or let them know how to worry about me, fear it.' Although there is a component of persuasion here, it is true, and it is the truth, that is, that is, there is nothing wrong, nothing to be strange. My old companion is very reasonable, not only does not complain about me, but also stepped down my heart to spend a difficult time with me. It was not until after the 'Cultural Revolution,' that my right was completely and officially defeated. I was living in the bucket room of Xiaocheng Lane. Liu Mo, Department Secretary General Secretary Liu Mo, read out the official decision to remove the right hat and cancel the original false conclusion. I wrote a few words and expressed my feelings, among them 'the sincere feeling of education and encouragement to me'. \\nIn the view of the general population, since the total rebellion is officially clear that the original right is false, then what education can talk about? So he also asked me what this sentence meant, and thought I was ironic. Actually, I didn't mean a little irony, and it was really my heart's saying: I have to be more careful from this day, isn't this an education for me? And what makes me strange is that after picking the hat, the gentleman who wore my hat seems like nothing else, as well as my warmth around, really called 'turning hands for the clouds and rain', 'slaughter can hold the boat'. \\nTo tell the story of the right, it must also be Mr. Ye Kung Chi. He was really wrong. I was an unnamed pawn at the time, but he was a prominent social celebrity who was personally invited by Prime Minister Zhou to return sincerely and sincerely with the desire to give effect to the country. But he came back to the right, but he fell on the right? He also complained everywhere. I don't know how to complain to others, but by Principal Chan I know. He and President Chen were very close for many years. After the Fu Ren period was very close, he wrote a lot of letters to President Chen, both affirming and grievances, and tried to confess himself to the authorities through President Chen's prestige. \\nPresident Chen is also really enough to speak out, risking the risk of grievances for the right, to send these letters to the Central Committee. As to whether they are handed over to Premier Zhou or others, I don't know. Later, he was picked up and continued to work on the text reform committee. Mr. Ye's cleverness is that he is good at learning lessons. Chairman Mao had written to him, 'Qin Yuan Spring, Snow', which he personally wrote, and since then he hung it on the main wall of the hall, and the image of Chairman Mao was hung on it again. Chairman Mao also wrote many letters to Mr. Ye, who put them on top of the most valuable boxes or drawers, as 'treasure of town boxes'. Later, when the more powerful 'Cultural Revolution', the Red Guards came to plunge their homes and opened a box, saw a letter from Chairman Mao above, and then opened another box, and saw another letter from Chairman Mao above. I don't know what this has come from this, I don't dare to go. And by his letter, it is not possible to change others. \\nWhen I suffered setbacks, President Chen helped me and rescued me, but in this political movement he wanted to 'care for the calf' again. But Principal Chan's concern at this time touched me more. Once he went to the glass factory and found that my collection of Ming, clear words are flowing into the painting shop there, knowing that I must be living difficult, before selling these beloved collections, so he no longer jokingly said: 'Is this for me?' From me a little or else 'looted' some word paintings, but paid for them, and immediately sent a secretary to visit me to inquire about my life, and also sent a hundred yuan. This has given me a lot of consolation in spirit, coupled with the help of my loved ones and friends, I mustered the courage to continue my life in adversity. (Editorial Solitude)\\n"

				"memoirContent": "【Attachment 2】Kickoff: Speech at the Anti-Right Criticism Meeting-Criticism of the 'bitter medicine' (Chinese Studies Service Centre, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, 'Folk History')\\nChairman, comrades, classmates:\\n'The bitter medicine special series', 'New and Modern Wonders', 'Wonders', is an extremist anti-socialist work. Its reactionary nature has been analyzed, exposed, rebutted and criticized by many comrades in all respects, and I will not repeat much. In addition, it also has a Mongolian coat, that is, as if its 'writing is quite good', 'enough classical literature taste'. So even some right-wing elements thought that this was the condition and capital that could be left as teaching assistants. Also because some people say: 'I can't understand', they think they themselves and fuel their price, they are obscure, they are smart. Let's take a look at these articles in terms of art forms and writing skills? Then talk about its reactionary content later. \\nIn the form of feudal orthodox literature at the beginning of the Ming and Qing Dynasty, this civic literature has its own progress, but after May 4, new literary forms for the new content of life have emerged, and those old forms only become historical heritage. Of course, we value heritage, we treat it critically to accept its essence, to remove their misses, it is appropriate to learn, not just to simulate it in form. A mere mock-up form is a backward approach. If the simulation is good, it is just 'fake antiques', simulation is not good, is 'East effect', more and more ugly. We first came into contact with these works, and its form first gives us a sense of failure. Chapter Hui is not available, modern also has a lot of chapter back to reflect the new society, but the 'bitter medicine special series' this use, especially to promote reactionary content, in addition to people outrage, but also feel bored, poor, vulgar, annoying...\\nAnyone can't read even good articles? The new literary movement is to revolutionize this kind of reversing literature. Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us that literary and artistic creation cannot be separated from life, cannot be separated from the masses, and cannot be relieved not to let people understand. So vulgar literary works, objects of the formal revolution, what is the value! Moreover, they make people not understand, they are not in line with the ancient Chinese grammar, and so much is not able to understand. Casual turn, some stiff, childish, poor, abnormal syntax, non-programming phenomenon visible. \\nHere's a few examples from words to words that don't work:\\nThe tenth 'favouritism is the age', 'on' how to say the word, implicated it, is it? Second series of 'exaggerated dimming', I only know that there is 'rendering', I have not heard of 'smoky' dyeing (here is not used when dyed), and 'just because of the fact', the whole sentence is not correct, proof, the original 'proof', the 21st 'smelling dumb words', both dumb and how can 'speech'? It turned out to be a dumb 'yes' error. There is an order like a series of 'source, layer out', we only know the idiom 'have seen stacked out', they do not hesitate to change the pair. \\nAgain, 'Like living in the land of mines, chestnut and self-trembling.' How mines become domain, chestnut is already 'trembling'. And as in the nineteenth 'after finding this matter, knowing that it is a classmate a Jun, the dream haunted from the fourth floor of the wild.' 'Haunted' has two meanings, one is fraud, the first is superstitious thinking that ghosts come to alarm. Is 'Haunted in a dream' a dream, or is it naughty in a dream? The seventeenth 'there is a lost dog', then said 'often followed by Mr. Kang's head', 'back' and 'dog' are really 'text' 'white' not called. This last poem says 'dog life howling into a gift, dedicated to the Lord of piety. There are no dogs in the world's yamen, no lord to whom to whom.' Just four sentences, the above words do not take the following words. It is not a teacher and student. What is the 'principal' from where is it called 'piety'? The third sentence is more unknown, four sentences linked, and who will 'talk'? \\nThere is also a semantic ambiguity like the 12th time, 'a masses forced landlords', or is this masses forced, or did he force the 'party secretary' mentioned above? Does the 15th 'suffering from evil' mean 'doing great blessing', or does it mean 'afflicted by evil'? Too many, too many people occupied space. Although, at the end there is one more. The twenty-sixth time, 'Happiness', I can't guess what it is, I still have 'not understood' list. \\nAs for the return, poetry of the flat, duality error, genre misdemeanor, is different. Just look at the opening of the West River moon words, that is, there is no paradox, other everywhere can encounter people to read not sad words. \\nIf it wasn't like this, that is, just in form, skill, I can't pass the score, I can't pass him, plus such reactionary content, I would have to give negative scores and collect debt from them. \\nHelping the Party to rectify the wind is originally an extremely solemn thing, that is, the ordinary presentation of opinions, and truthfulness is also the most basic requirement. For example, the dog, such as the author of this article, must not admit it, thinking that he is false, is not true. But how could they be able to make up all kinds of things at will? There are many people in the heart of thought activities, like the sixth 'muttering in the heart, the seventeenth 'because of self-thought', where did the author learn from? They said in the second series: 'First based on the spirit of fact and pick one side of things, select the ends of things, a little exaggerated, slightly topped.' And look at 'one side, number-end, exaggerated, set up,' this one-sided rumor intent, has already understood the confession itself. Look at a series of publications and said: 'especially to hit the place where there is no wind and rain', this should actually be said to go to the windy and rain place, well put on fire. \\nLiterary art has a special nature and purpose, and not literary works can be exaggerated everywhere, can be used fiction. 'Westward journey' 'gods' can be fictitious, history novels can not be completely fictitious. 'Three Kingdoms' such as Dongfeng and other things can be rendered, and the big show can not be completely upside down. For example, unable to write Sun Quan unification world, Cao Cao was sentenced to death. Not to mention general documents, some must not be exaggerated, such as accounting accounts, work reports, XXXX (?), The exam volume... this is well known, is it possible to take this special fictional approach to taking the matter of serious opinion? \\nThe 'bitter medicine special series' is a special form of literature as a cover to slander and attack the party. If someone accesses their facts, they can move away from literary fiction. If no one is accountable, they can confuse the hearing, reverse black and white, and the means are extremely spicy and crafty. \\nChairman Mao taught us that the political nature of literature and art is the first, the artistic second, but the two are inseparable. If it comes out of politics and reactionaries, the more artistic toxins will be. The art of the Bitter Medicine Special Series was not high, but he appeared in classical literary coat, dazzling readers, so that slightly curious people would not have to pick up and see, their attempts to disperse poison, and thus succeeded. Tang said: 'Desheng up, art down.' Just art into, is still the product, not to mention the 'bitter medicine special series' art is not enough 'into', plus the content of 'evil', really under the product. \\nI am saddened that I have taught a part of their classics class, I have not done enough of their thought education through teaching, and I should be guilty of reviewing it myself, but I didn't ask them to learn to do that, boring to simulate classical forms, to carry out anti-socialist activities! I now sue the right-wing elements: you should get back to justice early, accept the Party's salvation, honest account, in-depth review, and try to return to the people's ranks. This is the only way out, otherwise XX, regret it. \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"

				"memoirContent": "【Attached】Shanxi News Network: 'Remembering Qi Old' (2010.1.25)\\nYears of time, Qi Guiban-old Mr. Qi has passed away for more than 17 years. Qi old deep knowledge, open heart, sincere enthusiasm, is the mentor and friends of my generation, sometimes, like a warm brother. The cold went, the stars shifted, the water of time did not dilute our thoughts on him, he still lives in our hearts. \\nAfter the anti-Japanese flames in 1937, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Nankai University moved to Kunming, formed the Southwest General Assembly, which is a famous university of higher learning. In 1940, Chi Lao graduated from this prestigious school with outstanding grades. He studied chemistry and was unable to do this after graduation because he had established links with Third International, conducting revolutionary activities under the cover of teaching profession, reaching out to progressing youth and promoting anti-Japanese lives. After the restoration, he applied to Beijing as a middle school and university teacher, and transferred to Shanxi University after liberation. Due to his deep foundation, high degree of foreign language, and his hard work and meticulous work, he has accomplished excellence in ancient Chinese teaching and scientific research, especially in the field of jinshi text interpretation. Many of his discoveries and transcendence were praised by his colleagues as rigorous scrutiny and nothing. In order to study the shape and meaning of some ancient characters, write at night, read through the literature, often boil through the night. He said more than once that no new material was found and no new insight was not an academic paper. That is what he has sought for decades. \\nAttention to the spiritual realm, light on material life, the so-called 'peace of peace', this is the typical style of the older generation of intellectuals. For the first time, people will be surprised at his near-destitute life. Wooden beds, tables, chairs are the public ration of lacquered mottled furniture; double sofa cover black and yellow hard to tell, at least 20 years of things; a rattan box, said to be used when he went to Hong Kong in the 30s of the last century; more can be the two bookshelves, because there are more books, not let go, each bookshelf stacked With two pieces of about one meter wide planks, so that the old books that follow Chi Lao migrated for decades Shelter. As for the daily food and clothing, it is simple and very simple. In the 1980s, Qi Laohe and Mrs. Qi's wages were upper-middle, with only one son, and the family was not heavy, but they were always so indifferent, and they were all too quiet. Talking with Qi Lao, never mention wage treatment, eating and drinking enjoyment, always around the political situation, social life, governance, people and other topics. Spiritual wealthy, material poor, respectable! \\nIn his early years, Qi Lo became involved in revolutionary activities and progress, not only did a lot of work for the third international community, but also on the eve of the liberation of Beijing, to help gather and transmit information at the second place of the Jincha-Hebei Military Region, but that was at risk! The post-liberation history was not verified in time, seniority was not recognized, and in 1957 classified as a right-wing, heavy hat for 24 years. Despite such twists and turns, fate so bumpy, he has always been cheerful and optimistic, full of confidence in life, let the wind and rain hit, 'bite the mountain does not relax', believe that misunderstanding is temporary, history will always give him a innocence. He met his colleagues, friends, especially young people, always humble, smiling, talking up, helping this time, and commented on a high interest, as if he returned to the age of youth. \\nHappy to help young comrades, hard work, selfless dedication, is the usual style of this old scholar. Almost all of the people in the classroom have been helped by old guidance. The author is one of the many beneficiaries. I returned to my alma mater in 1979, while teaching ancient Chinese, while doing language research work on 'History', written in three articles before and after. Each article was sent to Qi Lao for review. Every time he made changes with small red characters from start to end, not only modified, but also added relevant information, added the discussion, and some places did it. The detailed instructions, touched me, always remembered. After their publication in the journal, they had some influence in academia, the first of which was also selected by the authoritative publication, Chinese Language, in the catalogue of important papers of the year. How much effort is immersed here! After Qi Lao reformed the original document, I kept carefully, and every look, I was inspired once. \\nQi old native Weihai, Shandong, his integrity and pride, make life unforgettable. He touted each other in the group of intellectuals, collaborators touted each other, or propagated rumors, provoked dissension, always disdain; more discouraged the vulgar style of self-dazzling graduation brand school, under the door of the master, holding 'fish' in his hands, and waggling around. Young people in the teaching and research office are willing to approach Qi Lao and ask him for advice. This also makes some people unhappy and ask people to come to lobby: 'You don't help young teachers change articles, they want to send articles, they have an attempt to evaluate their job titles.' Qi Lao said, 'Young colleagues let me see the article, how can I refuse it? It's not a bad thing to think about the title!' In the usual conversation and study discussion, he often bluntly denounced the wind of irregularities, quite liangshan haojie's evil attitude. Now, some teaching is pervasive, some turn scientific research into Internet download, send banknotes to send articles, go back door evaluation title, this can not help but reminiscent of Qi Lao who died for many years. \\nThe deceased, look at the sky, and emotion. So write a few words like this:\\nBook mountain climb Gao Zhuo, the end of the sea to see the firm. \\nHuaipu from Hehe sighs, tears philosophical people. (2010.1.25)"

It is really unfortunate that CUHK is congratulated! \\nThis year's Spring Festival, Xi Jinping first talked about 'pay attention to family construction, pay attention to family, pay attention to tutor, pay attention to family style'. The enlightened old son Xi Zhongxun was very 'valued at family building' in his life, he is the three 'pay attention' model, and is making future people respect and emulate. This mother is still paying special attention to the tutor. As Boxun's editors' friends rightly said: 'The authorities should learn from this point of view that it is unnatural to prohibit many overseas Chinese from returning home for political reasons.' 'The government should take the lead, pay attention to Tianlun humanity!' \\nWang Ning is the eldest son at home The firstborn, filial parents, are to bear more, and have become righteous. I have an appreciation of this aspect because of my eldest son. Twenty years ago, he left the congresses and went only to Hong Kong and Macao, and rescued the 86-year-old family mother behind bars from black prison in mainland China, and received the Netherlands in his old age, four together. The old man's last wish to be buried in the Netherlands, because he could not afford to buy the homeland cemetery, the children of the countryside sweeping the tomb, but also to be buried with my father Pei Gong, this 'dilemma'. What to do? 12 years ago, after the death of my mother and mother, I took advantage of my son Ahua (elder grandson), as a PhD student at the Dutch University of Science and Technology, and helped her niece Xiaowen's hometown work, took the grandfather's ashes out of the tomb underground, escort from Shanghai to Amsterdam, the two sons Co-burial, qie wishlist. In ancient times, the eldest son, grandson, grandson, long great-grandson, one more filial heart, want to be home, passed from generation to generation. For example, at 30 yesterday, although childish, granddaughter, Kerry's granddaughter, Cathy, saw his father and grandparents could not sit in the car, he took the initiative to take the train with her mother to go to her aunt's home for the New Year. So, I fully understand that Wang Ning is going to pick up his mother to settle in New Zealand and spend his old age. The firstborn, is to worry more about, share more, and more diligent than his brother. Not surprisingly small, not to mention the situation and environment, each other 'have a little bit of heart', this is the saying 'eldest brother is the father'! End this, blessing Wang Ning's mother went abroad smoothly, all the way safe, healthy and longevity! \\nNight thoughtful, dream. Perhaps from Bo Xun video, know what the mother said: 53 years ago (early 60's), when she married Wang Ning's father, Inner Mongolia water conservancy hall assigned a few square meters of poor room worm...\\nI learned that Wang Ning's parents, who originally worked at the Water Conservancy Department, dreamed 30 nights of the year, and met several old friends of old people. Among them, Qian Zhengying's uncle father and father, Mr. Qian Zhengsheng, of that year's Central Water Resources Minister of Water Conservancy, Spring Festival said the little story of old money, it is also a pastime and entertainment. \\nQian gengsheng is more alive, five seven right-wing, bank colleagues, Qian Zhengying's uncle. Qian Zhengying's father is a big brother who survives money. Qian gengsheng died prematurely, and money has pulled up her niece and raised money. In fact, it was the adoptive father of Qian Zhengying. She has been cultivating her to graduate to college and go to the Communist Party. \\nThe People's Bank, dual leadership, administration and business ownership system, the organization relationship of the party is based in the region. Since 1950, the Bank of Shanghai has been the most 'left' place in Shanghai and, of course, the country's most 'left' place, because the Communist Party of China wants to abolish private ownership. Whatever it does, it will first take the 'golden rice bowl' of the bank, such as canceling the bank's 'retention of wages', canceling 'financial hospitals', and canceling the bank's 'job' 'Job Housing' and so on. \\nAgainst the right in 1957, take the Shanghai Zhabei Bank as an example. At that time, less than a thousand people were beaten into the right, as many as 250 people, accounting for more than 25% of all cadres (at that time, the People's Bank was a state organ, and all employees were cadres compiled by cadres), greatly exceeded the target of 5 per cent, and the 'fixed right', even more than Winning, national exclusive, second to none. Even the Zhabei District Committee of the Communist Party of China at the time also felt that 'too many right-wing elements reported' were not approved to wear hats, but the bank party group 'rather don't right right', die not wrong, and did not dare openly confronted with the decision of the parent party committee. So in less than three months, many false right-wing parties in the line claimed 'hats picking', to reflect the party's 'leniency, caring, right, greatness'. This is why the People's Bank of the People's Bank 'hat-picking right' is the origin of why more It is also difficult to understand why in the summer and autumn of 1966, the Bank of Zhabei became the first 'revolutionary insurgency', with a strong public opinion base. \\nQian gengsheng is more tough, refuses to check, 'stubborn', not picked up. On a certain day in 1966, Qian Lien came to me quietly, applied to join the bank rebellion, and asked to work together to build up the counteractions of the Chinese Communist Party in power. And to say the reason, as early as 1957, 10 years ago, the Communist Party was indiscriminately wearing the 'right-wing' hat, was an authentic 'rebellion'. I said that the Communist Party is still emphasizing 'class struggle as the platform'. In society, the 'five categories of elements' are 'dictatorship' to the rich and bad of the land. If you participate in the rebellion, you do not come to fire, just authorize authoritarian and conservative factions, and defame the villains are 'ghosts', and make the Communist Party to 'change' Heaven, Forward Capitalism'. \\nOld money disobedience: why Wang Weixin can participate in the rebellion? I say: his situation is different. In 1957, the head of the credit section did not fart, and the party group mistakenly beat him as a 'right-wing', he was picked up in less than 50 days, and put it to the accounting department as a business backbone for use. Humanity, courtesy and courteous, the masses unanimously praised him, so I agreed that the Pharaoh joined the rebellion and became the counterparty committee of Tianmu East Road Branch (formerly the Accounting Section and the Cashier Branch), of the Rebel Team (Wang Weixin became the head of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of Communications in the early 1980s). Qian gengsheng is very good: what wearing a hat right, picking the right, not all belong to the right! It is strange to blame that Qian Zhengying, this girl does not understand. Having become a member of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of Water Resources of the Central Committee, the six parents did not recognize, and did not recognize my uncle and dad, and threatened to clear the family line! As long as she greet the party committee of the bank and say something fair, my right-wing hat will not be removed early. He was also excited about the law: everyone said you Zhang Ying revolved, advanced thinking, the greatest courage, it turned out to be a timid fear! I patiently said: This is not a question of courage, but not enough strength, to judge the situation, speak of political wisdom and command the art, and cannot be misused. Hard down, compromise plan: I agree that old money secretly join the rebellion, cancel early work, supervise his labor, and not allow anyone to criticize him. The special task is to collate the historical data of Deng Xiaoping (head of the Central Anti-Right Office in 1957), the bank has made a large number of historical data of right-wing false cases under the blind command of Deng Xiaoping (director of the Central Anti-Right Office). \\nQian gengsheng is more money, the father and daughter, if two people are judged. Qian gengsheng is more alive, man, believing that Zhang Ying supports the waist, secretly protects the right, indeed boldly wrapped the sky. In the early spring of 1967, early in February, Qian Shengsheng actually suspended on the wall of the business hall of Zhabei Bank, a huge 'great leader Chairman Mao Bao' throat, unbiased, knocking on a big nail, immediately caused a fluttering, a big wave. That is the great crime of 'cursing and damaging' Chairman Mao, and he wants to shoot and kill his head. (Needless to say, in the Cultural Revolution, that is 22 years later in 1989 Tiananmen Square, Yu Zhijian and other Hunan three warriors, throwing the egg paint on the old hair image of the city walls, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.), I smell the alarm, ordered to remove the hair image first, dial the nail, throat hole, cover the red cloth. Assess money to survive, and immediately a group review, under the name of 'non-proliferation', to control a small area. However, conservatives reported to the Public Security Bureau. People who come to the public prosecution law should immediately arrest the old right-wing money to correct. I know that once the old money is caught, it will die. Firmly Oppose: Since the January Revolution, the rebellion has been in power, there is a rule. As long as Zhang Ying is in power, no foreign unit, including the public prosecution law, will be allowed to take away any person from the bank! Qian is old, with high myopia, dim in the morning, called him to knock on the nails on his wall and accidentally damaged Chairman Mao's image. This is unintentional, do not go on the line, mention the height of framing the great leader. Of course, it is serious for money to commit this political mistake. Stay in this unit to re-educate and work as negative instructors in order to see the aftermath. The public security bureau came from the National Reform Council, and their supervisor was Cao Dehong (one of Wang Hongwen's 'five tiger generals' Ma Zhenlong's brother-in-law), and of course, I was 'old comrades'. They saw Zhang Ying dare to guarantee that it is natural to put money into life. I also openly said similar words in the bank's pull line broadcast, but I made an account, and the general public is rational and human. People said that since Zhang Ying has spoken, we will not pursue any further action. The so-called money has been framed by Chairman Mao's great leader in the incident. \\nA few days ago, Boxun published an offering of 'Zhang Ying: Mourning Mr. Bi Jianlong', following the 'January Revolution' of the rational and non-violent peaceful uprising of more than 1 million people in Shanghai in early 1967, slightly mentions: 'Since February 1967, banks have rebellious 'open the door'; March is unstoppable, preparing for the 'Three Combination' Revolutionary Council. After several repeated discussions, we reached the election of the new regime, democratic elections, consensus: whether it is a rebellion, a conservative, or a liberal faction, or even the right of the 57-right, as long as it is his own employees, there are civil rights; everyone has the right to vote, be elected; one person, one vote, direct election In the first round of elections, there are no candidates. Voters will write their own people directly on the ballot papers, and a majority of them are elected. ' If not full, the second round of the election will take the top ten candidates for the first round of the nomination; the last round, if necessary, the two parties are flawed, perfect and fully democratic. The problem is that the 57-right wing, at that time, was recognized as 'class enemy' in society. The Central Committee's 'Public Security Article Six' also denied the civil rights of 'dictatorship' rightists. Of course, the Bank of Shanghai neglected the unconstitutional and illegal set of Beijing, and took over Chairman Mao's 'flourishing' and 'acquittal' and other 'Yang' The slogan to 'seek', put the 'right' in line with the 'internal contradictions of the people'. They have the right to vote and be elected. The old right money is a 'current crime', beating the nails like a 'counter-revolutionary incident' in the mouth of the throat. The old money was pushed back to the wind, and the pressure I faced was very high. But I am going to say and do it, to allow people to 'make mistakes and correct mistakes'. Since we let all right-wing activists have the civil right to vote, Comrade Qian gengsheng is also the employee of this unit. Of course, there should be no exception. \\nRarely remember that in the early 1980s, once he met money to survive, his brother complained again: his right 'corrected', Qian Zhengying, this girl still refused to recognize his ancestors, and the Minister of Water Resources of the good end did not do, but gave his position to Li Peng, this kid, and would also support Li Peng to be deputy prime minister! I said Qian Zhengying gave way to Li Peng, to Deng Yingchao. Senior Communist Party officials need to talk about 'party nature'. They will not have a human nature. This is a domestic matter of the Communist Party's struggle for power. Whatever the fart of our ordinary people, there is no need to worry about it! Correct your right, and be thankful not to forget Hu Yaobang, which vigorously defies the false case! Haha-\\nFrom the three words of the water conservancy hall that Wang Ningling Tang said in the Boxun video, the night dreamed of Minister of Water Conservancy Qian Zhengying's uncle father and dad Qian more life, elucites the above piece of memories. This is not a 'Chinese dream', it's just a 'dream of life'. Record this dream, I want to parse for friends, Chinese New Year, tea after dinner, sharing entertainment, help digestion, fun! \\nLet's go again\\nHEALTH & SAFE\\ntake great advantage\\nZhang Ying Arch Hand\\nEuki Spring Festival Hekyo Night\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"

As of October 31, another 219 right-wing elements were excavated, plus the previously revealed right-wing elements totalling 1711, accounting for 0.87% of the total number of participants in the movement. Many right-wing elements, shocked by the party's policy call and the power of the masses, have begun to disintegrate. 1017 right-wing elements (59.44% of the struggles), have surrendered to us for forgiveness. While the attitude of some right-wing elements is still tough, their reactionary words and deeds have been completely exposed, criticized and isolated. \\nIn addition, the three large right-wing groups in Heilongjiang Province, which originally held, have now broken through the gap and are striking to hunt for great sharks in deep water. 'Heilongjiang Daily', headed by Zheng and Deputy Secretary General Qi guiyuan Guiyuan and Zhang Guochang (and colluded with Han Huafu, head of the press of the propaganda department), with a purpose, platform and systematic conspiracy against the opposition group. After the right-wing activist Wang Knowing (head of the newspaper's finance department), was revealed, the group has basically breakthrough. Put the lid already unveiled. Preliminary findings that the group includes the chief and deputy director of the Ministry of Finance and Economics and the Ministry of Industry and Communications of Heilongjiang Daily, including eight of them designated as right-wing elements, and the results are still expanding. \\nThe anti-party group of the provincial culture bureau, currently has a preliminary vision, the group involved the deputy director of the art section of the provincial culture bureau to one, deputy director of the provincial literature association Chen Ke, the Minister of Culture of Heilongjiang Daily Zhao Yun and the Harbin Daily, Hegang City, Qi guiyuanqihar Cultural Bureau is, deputy director, provincial review troupe Among others, there may also be Gao Yunladi, deputy director of the provincial culture bureau and party secretary, There are more than 30 key elements in this group, and are currently in deep digging. \\nIn this work, we have the following points:\\nFirst, the right-wing elements floating on the surface that are easy to break for the masses have basically been excavated.\\nThe 'single-headed households' of the right-wing elements were also largely fought. Now the problem is that there are still a lot of right-wing\\nThe group is still negative and recalcitrant, many of which are very widely involved, many people involved and have the background,\\nThe large sharks hidden in the deep water have curated for it. The development of the movement requires leadership cadres to\\nHave a strong revolutionary will and determination, to take up the battle in person and command the combat; study the situation and\\nLaunch the masses; only in this way, can the right-wing elements all be excavated to achieve deep penetration and obtain\\nThe final victory. Otherwise, the struggle cannot move forward. In order to strengthen the leadership structure, strengthen the specific fight\\nLeaders, after National Day, we based on the distribution of the right group, will save the eleven 'mouth' merger\\nFor the provincial committee system, provincial people's committee system, culture and education press publishing system, united war system and other 'mouth', each\\nBy the head of the secretary, the Standing Committee specific leadership, each responsible. And on major group cases, step by step\\nSet up a project. Several big cases directly under the control of the provincial committee, each of which has a cadre at the ministerial level of the provincial committee\\nBody conductor. As a result of the determination of the provincial committee and the measures taken to strengthen leadership, the movement has a new\\nColor up, achieved a significant effect. The right groups such as Heilongjiang Daily News Agency and Provincial Cultural Bureau were revealed\\nA clear example. \\nSecond, must do good material work. Solid material is the material basis for defeating the enemy, especially in\\nThe anti-right battle stage, digging deep sharks, breaking through the right group, material work is more important. \\nThe current problem is that the collection and collation of materials will not keep pace with the growing needs of the struggle. Rightists\\nThe openly released speech we noticed, but especially about the rhetoric behind it in the 'free market'\\nIt is the right who secretly planned and all sorts of ignition plots but did not pay good attention to collecting and finishing,\\nAnd the existence of a large number of 'suspected elements.' In order to dig deeper into the right, to 'neither draw more,\\n'There are also a lot of delineation', in addition to the organization all over the good learning 'central about 'dividing the right elements\\n'Notice of', the case for local reference, holding materials meeting to exchange experience of materials work\\nIn addition, at the same time, the material work has been reviewed several times by leading cadres personally. Check out the Naruto\\nTimeless group records and large print papers, purposefully held separately on issues omitted from past team records\\nActivist and middlemen talk to recall and inspire the masses to focus on exposing suspected elements behind\\nWords and Deeds Peace Day Speech. A detailed analysis of issues that have not been identified in the past has been revisited. Ching\\nAfter these work, a lot of problems and valuable clues were found, to dig deeply into the right\\nGood foundation. The Provincial Department of Transport, the Geological Office and the Forestry Department previously believed that there were no right-wing elements,\\nA total of eight right-wing elements were found after investigating the Ming release records. Five of the seven suspected elements in the Transportation Department can rise\\nFor right-wing elements. In the past, the Public Security Department had only two right-wing elements. It has now increased to 14, and there are suspicions.\\nMolecules twenty-four. \\nThird, fight for the right-wing uprising, digging deep sharks. Great Shark's Anti-Socialist\\nSpeeches are generally more hidden, their attitude is more cunning, but some of them are generally right behind the scenes\\nLeaders, do not dig them out, the movement can not be deep. Shuangyashan is a union from the struggle\\nWang Yutian, a general right-wing activist, started, and won his uprising power only after he pulled out the city and chairman of the miners union\\nXin Jingshan, in the struggle against Xin, also pulled out Liu Aiguo, chairman of the China Coal Mine Trade Union in Heilongjiang Province. \\nFourth, adopt a variety of forms of struggle. As the struggle deepens, rightists get more and more violent.\\nMore dew, in order to quickly and better fight right elements, not only to improve the fight strategy in time, improve\\nCombat art level, also take a variety of forms of struggle, such as organizing joint struggle, opening up new wars\\nField, to criticize the same kind of speech on similar issues. Recent Provincial Committee organs and provincial culture\\nThe art press and publishing community organized several hundred people's joint struggle congress, the provincial committee directly convened by the organs of the provincial committee\\nHan-Huafu (press director of the provincial committee propaganda department), Zhang Yue (Deputy Director of Propaganda Department), Xu Feng\\nQi guiyuan (Inspector of the Provincial Committee), and Dong Runfu and others criticized. As well prepared in advance, on the right\\nThe anti-socialist rhetoric of the elements rejected deeply, systematic, only four days, five comparisons\\nThe recalcitrant right-wing elements were refuted and confused. Immediately following the temporary adjournment of the General Assembly\\nFourteen right-wing struggles have now been fought and eight new right-wing elements have been discovered. SHENG\\nTen units, including industry, traffic department, post and telecommunication office, have taken to open up more battlefields and merge issues on similar issues\\nThe way to debate the original twenty groups into thirty-seven groups, focused on group struggles (more\\n(Equipped with a backbone), the method of combating the General Assembly, if necessary, would work better. \\nIn the current struggle, there are several issues that need to be further addressed:\\n1, a small number of units to 'good wind and work two' arrangement. such as provincial forestry department and water conservancy\\nHall, due to one-sided emphasis on work busy, stopped anti-right struggles from August, until now, still press\\nNot moving. \\n2, the approval of materials is very slow, according to our understanding in the materials work meeting recently held,\\nAll over the backlog of cases to varying degrees, did not approve it in time, only Qi guiyuanqihar and Mu\\nThe two cities of Danjiang now have three or four unapproved cases. The provincial people's committee system also has a hundred unapproved\\nGo. The main reason is that some units of material work of low quality, some material finishing is not meticulous,\\nThe problem is difficult to conclude due to inaccuracies.

				"memoirContent": "【Attached】Lin Jiahuang, Huang Bipei: 'Rightists working in rural areas of Jianou County continue to spread anti-socialist right-wing rhetoric against the party'\\n[Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou] Eleven right-wing elements of the Fujian Provincial Committee propaganda system who are working in rural areas of Jianou County are extremely individual, and most of them do not plead guilty and continue to spread a lot of right-wing rhetoric. \\n1, continue to viciously stigmatize anti-right struggle. Some slander anti-right struggles are that 'the Communist Party has nothing to do,' it is 'learning Cao Cao Cao to take advantage of his head and take the indignation of civilians,' and 'make good people into bad Some say that the anti-right faction dispersed her husband, 'I believed too much in the party when he enlarged, said a few more words, it was divided into the right'. 'The revolution is not as good as a revolution, and it turned out to be a right-wing party'. The right, Chi Huizhi, continues to play with her usual tactics, portraying the anti-right struggle as a matter of personnel relations in order to cover up her right-wing face. She said she would become the right, 'because my husband opposed the leadership, and I opposed the wife of the leader'. 'The Propaganda Department is reconsidering our problem' as a way to deceive the masses and incite other right-wing elements to turn the case. Some say, 'Not classified as the right, it is just a word of the leader.' 'Normally offended leadership, so become the right, and without attacking the leader when sounded, it will not become the right.' Some right-wing elements continue to expose entrenched hatred of the party towards socialism. Thinking that the anti-right faction is 'yes, right, nothing is nothing wrong, it is not 'yes' after knowing what is wrong today?' They did not convince the proxies of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang, saying that we 'treat the right as if the Soviet Union was dealing with the trustees at that time,' and that the treatment of them was 'too heavy.' Some say: 'The small right is better than the big right, the big right can not come down to work.' \\nA number of right-wing elements are also carefully preparing to turn the case. Rightists Tang all fantasy party central division, he said: 'it is better to fight the right is only the decision of some central leaders. In the future, someone will rise up against this movement and make a new estimate.' Xing Hangchuan, a right-wing activist, prepared 'materials' to reverse the case when he started working, and would use a few months to write a complaint to turn the case, and said: 'If the provincial committee cannot resolve it, you must go to the Central Committee to prosecute.' According to reports, the right has also gathered other right-wing elements to prepare a total counter-attack against the party. \\n2, slander socialism. The right-wing soups have slandered socialism as 'like feudal dynasty', saying what 'once the rulers of each dynasty take power, they kill the attackers', and cite Li Bai's poem, 'Success in return and return' as a quote, 'Labour reform is not the Communist Party. It is clear, but the dynasty of the past, now the right is better than the exile in the feudal dynasty.' 'The Communist Party's guts are narrow enough to accommodate the views of the people,' said. Most of the right-wing elements said: 'The rightists have bones, and Vino's are all left.' Rightist soups said: 'If Lu Xun is still there today, it will also become the right.' \\n3, slander socialist construction. These right-wing elements are hostile to the leap forward in socialist construction. A series of vicious attacks were carried out against people's communes, canteens and militarization of production. 'Great leap forward is forced out.' They believe that 'farmers have suffered too much,' and that 'farmers put their bellies to work', 'farmers should be allowed to rest and rejuvenate.' Tang, right-wing elements, said: 'Qi huizhin Shihuang built the Great Wall and Sui Yang Emperor to repair the Canal, but it was hard for the workers to hurt the wealth of the people. Now construction is also inevitably not the case.' 'It's hard to say that farmers can't resist this way.' The great leap forward felt to the right-wing elements is 'more and more pressure,' the right-wing member Liu Hong said: 'The pressure is big, the back pressure is greater.' They also argue that 'militarization of production is difficult to avoid not embarking on the path of commandship and is contrary to policies that persuade education'. Gong, a right-wing activist on the left, said, 'In addition to the courts, there is also a military justice division, which is illegal.' The majority of farmers eat in the cafeteria with joy, but these right-wing elements said: 'Farmers are not free and have lost the joy of eating together with a family under the pumpkin shed.' \\n4, many right-wing elements evade labor, resist transformation, some do not work for 20 days in a row. Some want to escape, some want to find another way, or retire home. Rightist soups also want to gather some right-wing elements elsewhere, go home to find employment or seclusion, and prepare for 'dongshan again'. They asked him why he was not very well transformed, and he said, 'Bad is bad.' The right-wing activist Liu Hong also instigated individual unconscious devolved cadres to become revolutionary deserters. In order to disguise their rightist identity, evade the supervision of her by the masses, he also described himself as a delegated cadre in front of the masses. \\n5, for Tito praise, for Naji shouting. When the party criticized Yugoslav revisionism, the rightists said: 'Do not come too early to conclude, Stalin has made such mistakes in the past, and do not repeat it now.' In criticizing the Communist Party, he wanted 'different attitudes among the communists.' He was delighted at the workers' committee of the Southern Communist Party, saying that 'the South has originality,' he fantasized that 'the international workers' movement is divided,' 'there are more different socialist countries; countries have different paths to socialism.' When Hungary executed treason criminal Naji, right-wing Gong Zuo believed that 'this is not in accordance with international law.' \\nWhen the international situation is tense, some right-wing elements preach the power of atomic bombs, arguing in physics that they can destroy the Earth and do everything together. Liu Hong, a right-wing member, also said: 'The power of the US atomic bomb has been seen in Hiroshima. Although the Soviet Union also has, it has not seen' (meaning that the United States is stronger than the Soviet Union). (Xinhua News Agency, Internal Reference, November 6, 1958)\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 2"

It's also amazing to learn so many things in 300 hours.' The head of the Primary Education Department instructed Qi jianhua to try and teach a class first after going back, and if successful, then promote it to the whole country. Qi jianhua returned to Xixian County with full confidence. With the approval of the local education department, he conducted a 71-hour trial on illiterate and semi-illiterate village in Guozhuang village.

He invented the Rapid Literacy Act, which has removed over 50 million illiterate hats across the country. At that time, Mao Zedong called him 'literally literate expert', Liu Shaoqi called him 'contemporary Changjie' and Lu Dingyi called him 'China's second largest saint.' As a military alumni, I am proud of his outstanding contribution, and at the same time I deplore his troubled life. Seven or eight years after Comrade Qi jianhua's death, we cannot forget the comrades who made merit for the cause of the revolution, now recounts his troubled life for remembrance. \\n'Qi jianhua Rapid Literacy Law' is known throughout the country\\nQi jianhua was born in 1921 in Houjiao Village, Henan Province, a poor farmhouse. In early 1948, he was admitted to Yu Shaan E Military University (later merged into Zhongyuan Military University). After graduation, he was assigned to a military health ministry as a cultural officer, and participated in the Huaihai Campaign and the Battle of the Dujiang River, and joined the Communist Party of China in 1949. On his way to the Great Southwest, he began to study the teaching methods of rapid literacy. After repeated practice and research, with traditional Chinese pinyin letters as a stick, he finally created a rapid literacy programme suitable for illiterate and semi-illiterate learning culture among army cadres and fighters, enabling an illiterate to learn more than 3,000 commonly used Chinese characters in less than 30 days, and can read, write, and run With. This literacy teaching programme is called 'Qi jianhua Sucheng Literacy Law'. \\nIn 1951, the Political Department of the Southwest Military Region decided to give Qi jianhua a special distinction and awarded the honorary title of 'model cultural teacher'. In December 1951, the General Political Department informed the entire army of the widespread implementation of the 'Rapid Literacy Law'. In April 1952, the Education Committee of the Council held a solemn recognition meeting. More than 100 experts and scholars from education and culture including Xu Tili, Ye Shengtao were invited to attend. Guo Moruo personally presented the award for Qi jianhua and called on cultural workers across the country to learn from him. After the meeting, 10 people including Zhang Jihui and writer Gao Yubao, Qi jianhua and the author Gao Yubao were considered 'Yizi' by revolutionary elder Zhang Wenqiu, and received a souvenir from Liu Siqi's hand-a picture of Zhang Wenqiu's family including Chairman Mao Zedong. In November 1952, at its 19th meeting, the Central People's Government Committee decided to appoint prominent linguist Chutunan as head of the first national literacy committee and three other persons as deputy director of Qi jianhua. Qi jianhua, who became a deputy ministry cadre at the age of 31 years old, travelled through major military regions and across the country, making reports, conducting research, writing letters, and busy in the rest of the day. \\nUntil 1956, Qi jianhua, 35, was alone. Just this year, he was invited to lecture in Chongqing. A 'Jiangnan Talent Woman' graduated from Tsinghua University, admired his talents and entered his life. After a period of interaction, the two people were married. But where did Qi jianhua know that a storm that endangered his life was coming to him step by step. \\nBeing mistaken as 'right', suffering\\nI don't know whether it's jealous or political affliction. Qi jianhua has tirelessly taught lecturers, and was actually accused by some people of 'unorganized discipline' and engaged in a critical struggle. He was declared 'right' in 1957, followed by dismissal from party nationality, military and public office, and his wife left him. He was taken to Mianning, Sichuan, for labor rehabilitation, only with his younger daughter, Qi Hongwei. Mianning mountain high forest dense, road risk is scarce, Qi jianhua's place of labor is to the depths of the pristine forest logging. There, this clandestine man has experienced an unbearable ordeal. The swaddling daughter nobody took care of, he found the rope, tied the child to his chest to work; without milk feeding the child, he quietly packed the soup into the bottle, with the feeding meal saved from his mouth to pamper the unfortunate daughter. That's why he stayed here for five years. \\nUnder the arrangements of the General Political Department of the PLA, in the autumn and winter of 1963, Qi jianhua returned with her daughter to Jixian County, Henan Province. Before Huiwu County, he paid special attention to Beijing and wanted to see his wife who had lived together for a period of time, while visiting Zhang Wenqiu's mother. Mom Zhang told him that your wife had filed a divorce. Qi jianhua had to accept the transportation costs and clothing provided by Zhang's mother, and left Beijing to return home. \\nQi jianhua returned to his grandmother's home, Li Zhuang Village, in Henan province, to take care of their fathers and daughters. The production team arranged him to grow vegetables, a ethnographic 6 acres vegetable garden. During the day he focused on loosening soil weeding, taking manure and sprinkling medicine; at night he pushed a heavy water truck to the vegetable garden. These jobs, which need six or seven labor to complete, were hardened by one man. During the 16 years of return to home before the 'right' rebels, Qi jianhua suffered hard. No food, he had eaten raw pumpkin, raw eggplant, elm leaves, and had not eaten pork for years, did not stain oil, even eat salt is very difficult. Without a house, live in a dish, too cold in the winter, dig a cellar in the dish, lie inside the cold. No clothes were worn, and the old clothes worn in the army were worn and worn, and the quilt covered at night was left by the mother's death, which was also cut for her daughter to make a cotton coat. The hardship of life coupled with heavy physical labor has tortured him out of humanity. When a newspaper reporter found him in Li Zhuang County, Henan Province, Qi jianhua, which was more than 1.8 meters tall and fenghua-mao, at that time, had become a humpback old man with only one meter out of the head, even the road was difficult to walk. So in adversity he was still a red heart and worked out new 'phonetic solutions.' \\nThe 'Pinyin New Case' is gradually promoted in the Middle State\\nDuring difficult days, Qi jianhua, daughter Qi Hongwei reached the school age, and he taught himself without the money to go to school, and did not really want to teach a 'new Pinyin case'. One morning, Qi jianhua asked her daughter about learning Chinese pinyin, and her daughter said: 'It's easy to fight, two hard work, three more difficult, can change it just fine.' Her daughter's words remind Qi jianhua, why not find a shortcut for the child to learn? He considered, where is 'more difficult to fight'? With experience in creating the Rapid Literacy Law, he has repeatedly 'filtered' the Chinese Pinyin Programme and over and over and over and over and over, finally came up with a way to compile a new 'Pinyin Case'. \\nIn 1967, Qi jianhua tested the 'Pinyin New Case' on her 10-year-old daughter. After five consecutive days of study, daughters literate more than 3,000. And through three days of review, you can recite one to four volumes of Mao Zedong, with only 3% of raw characters. Qi Jian Hua Hin is ecstatic. In 1969, Qi jianhua brought her daughter to the Ministry of Education with joy of success. He was hosted by the head of the Primary Education Department who, after reading the child's live demo, said: 'It may also be your daughter is talented, not to say that it's a miracle to learn more than 3,000 Chinese characters in more than 70 hours. It's also amazing to learn so many things in 300 hours.' The head of the Primary Education Department instructed Qi jianhua to try and teach a class first after going back, and if successful, then promote it to the whole country. Qi jianhua returned to Xixian County with full confidence. With the approval of the local education department, he conducted a 71-hour trial on illiterate and semi-illiterate village in Guozhuang village. The trainees, in total, 3,216 words, were finally applied to a comprehensive literacy, dictation and writing test, with an average score of 82.78. \\nQi jianhua will report the trial to the Ministry of Education and to the Chinese Language and Text Reform Commission. Three months later received a reply to the message, saying: Although the 'Pinyin New Case' has its characteristics and easy to use, the current 'Chinese Pinyin Scheme' is statutory, please Qi jianhua not to insist on his opinions. That no anisotropy he splashed a pale of cold water Until 1982 after Qi jianhua, he visited students in Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, and learned that Qi jianhua inventively improved the bead algorithm after creating the 'Pinyin New Case', and asked him to give lectures in Xiangcheng County. The masses heard that Qi jianhua, known for creating 'rapid literacy law' in the 50s, personally coached. The registrants are in the tide, so that his 'Pinyin New Case' was gradually pushed out in the Middle State Land. \\nReparation, marriage, care of old leaders\\nThe spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the 11th CPC Central Committee has blown through the land of the motherland like the spring breeze, and it also blows to Qi In 1979, Qi jianhua's grievances were rehabilitated and party nationality, military nationality and public office were restored. However, they were only settled locally, and later added to the Standing Committee of the Henan Provincial Committee of the CPPCC. In 1982, when he was invited to run a class in Xiangcheng County, an 18-year-old girl Li Qiaomei slowly walked into his living space. A lovely daughter was born in the second year after marriage, named Qi Huiqiong. Although Qi jianhua's grievances, his life is still very painful. In order to make a living, Li Qiaomei, without Qi jianhua, found the local government and said his family's dilemma. Xixian County Committee attached great importance and immediately arranged Li Qiaomei to substitute for primary school; in the following year, under the care of the relevant departments, she was converted to a public teacher. \\nIn the 1990s, Qi jianhua made a chance to read the melting pot of revolution published by the Institute of History of the Nino Military and Political University, where an article made him contact with his elder chief and mother Zhang, who had lost his message for many years. This article recalls the glorious performance of Qi jianhua's invention of the Rapid Literacy Law and pays tribute to his 'early death'. Despite the false report of the article, 'living as a dead sacrifice', he still felt unexpected joy. Through this thread, Qi jianhua made contact with the former force, which had been interrupted for nearly 40 years. \\nIn 1998, General Shao Hua was invited by his mother Zhang Wenqiu, and invited Qi jianhua to Jing. Because of his weakness, Qi jianhua asked his daughter Qi Hongwei to visit his mother Zhang on his behalf. When Qi jianhua was hit as the right, Zhang's mother had persuaded the righteous son to cheer up his spirit, leaving the 'green mountain'. At this time, Qi jianhua, after sending her daughter off, kneeling north kneeling on the ground with tears knocked three rings to thank the elderly people for their unforgettable grace. \\nOn September 13, 1999, the 10-episode TV series 'A Thousands of Strikes' reflecting the story of the struggle of the Jino Army youth students held a premiere in Beijing. Liu Huaqing, former vice-chairman of the military commission who attended the premiere, learned about Qi jianhua's recent situation, said emotionally: 'We can't watch our comrades who made merit for the revolution so destitute.' Seven days later, Liu Huaqing and Zhang Yan jointly wrote a letter to Tian Chengzhong, secretary of the Municipal Committee of Pingdingshan City Committee, suggesting that Comrade Qi jianhua, who made a contribution to the national literacy campaign in the 50s, give the necessary attention. Henan Provincial Committee, Pingdingshan Municipal Committee and Xixian County Committee attached great importance, with the assistance of the Henan Erye Army University History Research Association, arranged Qi jianhua's later life. In May 2000, Qi jianhua moved into his new residence in Tang Street Town, which the government allocated funds. The house is engraved 'People's hero Qi jianhua residence' several large characters. \\nDiligence, Literacy Fest\\nAround 2000, dozens of newspapers and television stations across the country reported and publicized his troubled experiences and touching stories of innovation in cultural and educational causes. Some came back with a few hundred miles, and went into the door and fell to his knock thanks; Old professor from Beijing, full of silver hair, tightly held his hand, intersecting feelings; retired teachers from Heilongjiang, supported by son-in-law, bowed to him deeply; a PLA university with his entourage, drove to his house, solemn 'You are the pride of our three generations of PLA.' A deputy secretary-general of Henan Provincial Committee stepped into the threshold, the first sentence of the export is, 'Qi Lao, we are late!' Faced with flowers, shots, and a pair of hands reaching him, he always said: 'I have contributed too little to the people.' A month before his death, he also held a lecture at Jixian County continuing training school, and often overtime time to answer questions. It is 'spring silkworm to the dead, wax torch into tears to dry'. \\nQi jianhua moved into his new home for just over a year. He died on August 11, 2001, at the age of 81 at the hospital in his hometown, Henan Jixian County, because of his long-term work for cultural and educational work. After the death of Qi jianhua, Xixian County leaders set up Qi jianhua Comrade Mourning Committee. The secretary of the county committee personally served as the director of the funeral treatment committee. The leaders of the county's major teams participated in the mourning committee and held a solemn memorial service for Qi jianhua. Chengdu Military Region sent a special person to his home for condolences and sent condolences to the gold 1,000 yuan. After Qi jianhua left his wife (40 years old, primary school teacher), female (19 years old, secondary school student), each of whom lived in Tangjie Town, Qiaomei's mother and daughter were living on Li Qiaomei's salary. \\nTail\\nQi jianhua's eldest daughter, Qi Hongwei, who works in Wuhan, said in 'Remembrance of his father, Qi jianhua, who lost his life for innovation and education,' said: 'His father's life is a glorious life, it is a life without regret. Although his father's life has passed away, he left behind a valuable legacy of Chinese culture, which is the 'four speed new law' of 'Chinese Language', 'New Law for Early Childhood Rapid Literacy', 'Fast Teaching Law', and 'Fast Beads Algorithm'. As his daughter, I was a witness to the invention of my father, and the first and greatest beneficiary of the new law. Therefore, I will inherit my father's work, carry forward the father's inventions and create and spread the Hereafter, for the benefit of the people. When these inventions are more widely applied to the cause of human progress, fathers must be delighted and proud. May Father have knowledge under the spring. (Jinan, August 2008)\\nPAGE 5"

Three brothers Qi Ming and five sisters. Qi Ming's sister is called Qiqiu, a few years older than him. Sister Qi Xiuwen, five years younger than him. Big brother Chisin, about 12 years younger than him. Little brother Qi Bin, about 16 years younger than him. Siming's father brothers six, his father is the smallest. \\nSiming's home is not rich. In addition to their own few acres of thin land, there are a few acres of official places. Officials, is a common land within the family, the official land is rented for the expenses of the family's affairs. Officially far away from home, in the morning, walked to noon. Far from home, it is relatively barren. Officially, Hu Ming tree rent, when grandpa went to rent, Hu Ming tree holding a pickaxe to hit people, said you do not even collect the seeds back, still want to rent? Grandpa is timid, is a man who drops leaves and fears to smash people. Grandma headed, never went to rent in the future. \\nWhen Qi ming went to school, school meals were not able to eat. Bring some corn noodles from home, under the shack in the field, and classmate Li Yuzhi took a small pot with a tree branch to eat tortillas. \\nIn 1938, Qi ming read high hours wrote an essay, entitled 'Seven Seven Rain Parades', articles are written and filled with progressive ideas, schools as Fan Wen posted and disseminated throughout the county. The principal of the school was an underground party member. He did not graduate. He introduced seven progressive young people, including Qi Ming and Li Yuzhi, to Yan'an. The poor in Qi ming's family were not wound up, and his father sold a cow to 13 existing oceans, and let him go to Yan'an as a road fee. \\nQi Ming and Li Yuzhi 1 were to study in North Shaanxi in Yanan Wu Bao Qing training class. At that time, the Kuomintang at the three campuses in Xi'an, openly went to the youth training class for anti-Japanese youths, saying that they ate rice white noodles there and returned to the White Ocean. Of the seven people they came with, five could not withstand the temptation to go with the KMT. He and Li Yuzhi went to Yan'an. \\nAfter graduating to Yan'an, he was assigned to the Children's and Women's Corps and later to the Eighth Route Army Health School as a drug. He did not love health work, and he wrote a letter to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao approved the letter to Wang Jiaxiang, deputy director of the General Political Affairs Department, and Hu Yaobang, Minister of the General Political Organization, asked him to talk to him, so that he could train a person who could take over his job. He was admitted to Lu Xun College of Arts and Literature in 1940. He Jingzhi, Li Ji and he were classmates. \\nIn 1943 Yan'an rectified wind, Qi ming was questioned. Using wheel warfare to force him to admit to being an agent of the Kuomintang, forced him to ask him, 'The KMT blockade is so strict that anyone else can not come. Why can you come?' That makes him unable to answer. Can not say, only a hundred, he took a sleeping pill. Because sleeping pills expire, death is not complete. He was in a coma for seven days and seven nights, and after waking up, the vocal cord was damaged without sound. He then took part in the spinning raids of the big production campaign. He had his hands full of blood bubbles, spinning 12 stone 5 bucket millet, was rated as a model of labor in the tripartite area. Award him a clay white cloth at the assembly. In 1944, he went to Chengchuan police three brigades nine regiment battalion as a cultural teacher Meet Lu Yi classmates Gobayak. As a cultural teacher at the Chengchuan Central Institute for Nationalities, Gobayo spoke about the situation in Yanan Lu Yi Mao Zedong to bow off their caps for the wronged classmates. Before the meeting, the classmates were fiercely gazing at two eyes to see how Chairman Mao addressed to everyone: everyone came to Yan'an to participate in the revolution, not to be an agent! Chairman Mao came to the venue, bowed deeply to everyone, saying: 'I came to give you today a take-off ceremony. Everyone has a head size, big wearing a small hat, will have a headache; a small big hat, cover your eyes, the whole wind to wear the wrong hat...'\\nYoung students are easy to move, as soon as Chairman Mao is so sincere, everyone cried loudly and said: 'With you these words, we do not go...'\\nMore than a year ago, Qi ming wrote more than 700 articles, informing about praise within the UNDF forces. \\nIn 1945, Qi ming was transferred back to Yan'an. The Department ordered him to join the party and asked him to editor-in-chief, Force Life. In 1946, because of his success in preparing for the teaching brigade, Wei Zhiming, director of the Political Department of the brigade, called on everyone to learn from him at the cadre meeting. \\nIn the years of the liberation war, he worked for newspaper communications in the political section of IYE. He edited the oil stamped tabloid 'Newsletter', 'Reference News', 'Working Newsletter', and was repeatedly praised by Commander Peng Dehuai. Peng called on Xinhua News Agency reporters in the army to directly reflect the real situation of the troops to Qi ming. \\nIn 1948, the battle of Western Province, originally planned to leave the Linyou mountain area as the basis, did not expect the four army a brigade in the south bank of Weihe, suddenly evacuated to the north shore, exposing the headquarters to the enemy. Forced Peng always put a barge gun, re-changing the deployment of the entire field army. On the road to the withdrawal along Qianyang Hebei, Peng said: 'The liberal ideology of the small bourgeois really killed!' The entire army withdrew the border area, and at the expansion meeting of the former committee of earth-foundation, Wang Shitai, conducted a deep review. As a result, the pace of liberation of Xi'an was postponed for a year. In May 1949, Xi'an liberated, organ cadres were busy talking about objects, Qi ming also talked about a girlfriend. The girlfriend told him that someone was printing counterfeit money. Qi Ming felt that the news was very important. He worked with the public security department to quickly broke the case and received praise from Peng general. \\nDuring the Yan'an period, Qi ming once published poems under the pseudonymous Qi ming, Goth, Shi Yong, Qi ming's Poems of Laoshan One Day (1941 'New Poetry' magazine), 'We are the Spring Plong Commando' (Yan'an Liberation Daily, May 7, 1942), 'Mongolian Mother' (4 September 1945, Yan'an, 'Liberation' (Daily), and a large number of poems and newsletters published under Ding Ke as a pen name Report. Qi ming published poetry in Suide poetry magazine at the age of 16. He was also able to write about 6,700 articles a year. Wang Zhen also likes Qi ming's article. \\n2\\nThe peaceful liberation of Xinjiang, the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered the country. Qi ming is the military representative of the literary and artistic world and director of the military management council of literature and art. He is a three-member group of the Xinjiang Joint Preparatory Committee with Ma Hangbing and Zi Jamaiti. Founded, he is the actual head of the Federation, the first director of the culture department of the Xinjiang provincial government, one of the editorial board of the Xinjiang military literature and art. His level is twelve. Qi ming and Ma Hangbing and Zi Jamaiti were then known as the three giants of Xinjiang's cultural community. \\nIn the early 1950s, he was instructed to lead a group of ethnic groups of over 100 people from all walks of life from all walks of life in the five northwest provinces, and the delegation came back. One Uighur people went to Beijing to turn a big eye-opening circle and said after coming back: 'Feed the river-, Uncle Black is much very, dense, kill can't be finished!' Uncle Black, was the desperation of the habit of the Han people of the Uighur ethnic group at that time. \\nIn 1952, Qi ming returned to Henan home to visit his parents. This was his first home after taking part in the revolution in 1938. Nanyang Neixiang County is located in Funiu mountain area, often haunted by bandits. For safety, he took the guard stone so expensive, and he was also equipped with a gun. When he came home, he knew that the family was divided into a rich farmer at the time of the land reform. The family was sweeped out and lived in a tattered house. There are not even the grain noodles at home, only high beam. Mom looked at the son and brought a civil servant, wondering what to do to them eat, embarrassed. Qi ming let stone more expensive to go to the town to buy some white noodles Qi ming participated in the land reform and knew that according to his family's circumstances should not be classified as rich farmers. \\nThe land reform is based on the land of the first three years of division, and they did not take into account their assessment. They knew that Qi had a son out, but did not know that it was participating in the revolution. Qi ming wrote a letter to his family after participating in the revolution. The letter was sent back by others, and his mother received it a year or two later. There are more bandits in their hometown, often cutting off the heads of family members participating in the Communist Party, hanging on the walls of the city or lighting the sky lights. The mother pressed the letter under the slate for fear that the family knew that his son had participated in the revolution. War years, Qi Ming did not write a letter to the family again. The family did not know his death, and outsiders thought that he was part of the Kuomintang was killed by the Communist Party. Their house has a place of law, six of the brothers of Ziming's father, and shall be divided according to six. When the land reform, his father still had a little selfishness, and wrote to his name, and every son in the future could be more than a little bit. His mother was a little foot, far away, and his father had only one labor force at home. The official land (cemetery), was rented to Ho Ming Shu, he never handed over a grain of grain. He and his mother found the district committee secretary Yuan Suoqing pulled the hand of Qi Ming and said, 'Oh, originally our own comrades, ah, I'm sorry!' \\nQi Ming's sister Qi Jiqiu married Zhang Bingzheng, the family has a pharmacy, life is pretty good. The sister was forced to marry the relative of his brother-in-law, a company cadre of the KMT. The sister was extremely unhappy with her marriage and sighed all day long. She sought the advice of Qi ming, saying that it is now a new society and is not satisfied with the possibility of divorce. \\nMother Alignment said that we can't stay at home, what if someone closes us up in the middle of the night? Qi ming, considering the complex situation in his hometown, Xinjiang is also in need of a large number of people. When he returned, he took his father, mother, sister and two brothers. Qi ming walked out of the village far, and met the childhood play companion Huang Tingguo. Huang Tingguo's generation is high, and Huang Cheng has a little relative. Huang Cheng shouted his uncle, and Qi Ming called his uncle. As a child, they and Li Yuzhi were playing big pieces together. Qi Ming, Li Yuzhi and Huang Cheng left their homes to go to Yan'an, while Huang Tingguo is still in rural areas. Huang Tingguo's day at home is very sad, want to come out with a piece of Qi Ming. Qi ming wrote a note for him to go to Xi'an to find people from the Xinjiang office in Xi'an, who arranged for him to travel to Xinjiang. \\nQi ming returned from his home, and arranged his parents and sisters, he went to Hetian with the rent reduction anti-domination working group. Qi ming and Huang Cheng grew up together when he talked about Huang Tingguo also came to Xinjiang, Huang Cheng said: 'Alas-Qi ming, you brought the son of the bully landlord out?' Huang Cheng's mother shouted Qi and said, 'Do not say this way, his family is a bully landlord, but he is born of a young lady. He looked at his mother's pretty, and took his mother. He is also a victim, often underestimated!' \\nQi Ming and Huang Cheng came out of a village, both participated in the revolution and participated in the PLA, and the two men were not in one force. When the Second Army entered southern Xinjiang to Aksu, it was learned that KMT agents planned an armed rebellion in Hetian, and the division leadership ordered the 15th regiment to enter Hetian. Vice committee Huang Cheng and deputy head Gong Ziyun led 15 regiments across the Taklimakan desert straight into Hetian. Having worked hard to overcome unimaginable hardships, they set an unprecedented record of marching in the desert on a journey of more than 790 kilometers on the rolling quicksand. \\n3\\nQi ming was at the beginning of the 'Three Counter' campaign, which was aimed at streamlining politics, increasing production and saving, opposing corruption, against waste and bureaucracy. Liu Xiao Wu brought the 'three counter-' working group to enter the Xinjiang Wenlian. The working group wanted to understand the issue of Saming, give his guard guard Shih how expensive to do his job, mobilized stone to expose Zimong, and wish him to be Chief of Section. \\nFinally, with class alienants, 'embezzlement, scalping gold, sheltering the landlord's family', pulled Qi ming down from the leading position of Wenlian. After Qi Ming went to Ma, Liu Xiaowu became the Director of the Department of Arts and Arts of Xinjiang Province and Chairman of Wen Lian. Instead of being Chief of Section, Shitoku opened a car, and later did it alone. Stone is so expensive, and cry with the leg of Qi Ming, give him a reward, said not to be nonsense...\\nAfter coming to Xinjiang, Qi Ming met Chen Ruizhang of Dihua literary team. Chen Ruizhang is a descendant of Tianjin Yangliuqing, adopted by the Uighur ethnic group, dancing with famous dancer Kombar Khan. She was a very good actor. After her marriage, she felt Ziming was a good and honest person who told him that he could not be born and offered a divorce. Qi ming had approved the report of the literary team to buy dance shoes, which was also counted on the head of Ziming, saying that he was embezzled by private disguise. Sheltering the landlord's family means that he received his parents and younger siblings to Xinjiang. Scalping gold, but he doesn't know where to talk about it. \\nLiu Xiaowu was Liu Baiyu's brother. When the PLA entered Jiang, he was the head of the arts section of the six army. Qi Ming came up from the position of Director of Arts and Arts and the WWU leadership, and an office with Minister of Propaganda Lin Bemin, a desk, face to face to face. Although he had no authority, he still had a pen in his hand and was a writer under the Ministry of Publicity. \\nIn order to write the 'North Tibet First Confinement Team' script, he embarked on his way to Ali along with the Central Condolences Group. \\nUrumqi to Ali is 23,000 kilometers, and from Hetian to Ali there are more than 1,000 kilometers. At that time, Yacheng to Ali had no easy road, only through the original ancient road. They were riding camels, yaks, walking, and they went to Ali for over a month. Qi ming did not bring an introduction letter, Qi ming wanted himself to be a business card, where to go where can not know it? Ali belongs to high altitude areas, hypoxia, can not be cold. Immediately after the cold is emphysema, and once emphysema, life will be at stake. In Ali Qi ming suffered a cold, big mouth gasping, almost died a little bit, the beard was shaved well. A deputy commander did not buy his account, saying that he was an agent, and the military subdivision sent him back to Wada. Huang Cheng, secretary of the Field Committee, knew the fineness of Qi ming, and nothing was done. \\nHuang Cheng and the team leader of the autonomous region going down, see Qi ming, or a single one now, all say you alone? So, everybody introduced him to a hospital nurse, who was decentralized from the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, and the people were very beautiful. On her wedding night, she told Ziming a whole lot of things. Ziming's heart is very worthwhile, the next day separated. The woman's troubled, make it impossible to do. After returning to Urumqi, two lived in the military district guest house. \\nOne night, Qi ming had a chat in Ding Long in the military district next month, and it was late to walk. Soon after walking, Siming returned. Ding Long met on the way to the toilet. He was anxious to look. Din Lang asked you, didn't you go, how did you come again? Qi ming said: 'Oh, a little bit of things!' Qi ming went back, encountered the awkward thing, and came back to find left Qi. Zuo Qi came to Zhang Xiqin to negotiate. Zuo Qi is the military district political committee, and Zhang Xiqin is the chief of the military region staff. After consultation, the two people made arrangements. The next morning, Ding Lang was still sleeping, left Qi ran to Ding Long's house, saying, 'Get up, to the guest house to see Ziming gone?' 'He was here last night,' said Din Long. He said, 'Don't care, go see!' Ding Lang went to see, people went to the room empty, the door hung a lock. \\n... not a long period of marriage, which ended. \\nIn the spring of 1953, Du Pengcheng lived in Beijing for a year, focusing on modifying the novel 'Defending Yan'an'. Finalized at the end of the year, listed as one of the 'PLA literary series', 'PLA Literature and Art' in 1954, the 1st and 2nd issues were selected for 'CIP Long Town' and 'Shajiadan' two chapters respectively. At this time, Du Pengcheng is already small famous. He very much appreciated Hu Fengpai Lu Ling's 'Battle on the Concave Land'. Siming was also in Beijing. \\nQi ming is ready to move to the PLA newspaper. Ma Hanbing in Beijing Quanjude invited Wang Enmao to eat roast duck, let Qi song accompany. Qi Ming and Ma cold ice are good friends. Between meals, Qi Ming and Wang Enmao talked about mobility. Wang Enmao said that you still know some words, you are familiar with the situation there, you still stay there. Qi Ming believes Wang Enmao. Qi Ming thinks Wang Enmao is now the first handle in Xinjiang. What is the thing? He would just say hello to them? \\nQi ming and Luyuan, Du Pengcheng and other people bought roasted chicken and white tin bags of cigarettes to see Hu Feng. That was the literary star in their hearts. Qi ming has a habit of journaling, he wrote a few words on the diary, and wrote down the matter. \\nIn 1954, Du Pengcheng's 'Defending Yan'an' was published. Qi ming was invited by the Beijing Library to make a report to Beijing universities. The Beijing Library gave him a special 'invitation card' to start recording, and see what effect he said. After having recorded a paragraph, they were very good at the same time, they said not to record it. \\nQi ming made a report entitled 'From Life to Creation', which was a sensational effect. Youth groups of Beijing universities turned to him to report; the Northwest Language Alliance group learned the news from the radio and sent him a reward message. Northwest Bureau electric warrants Wang Enmao Miao Qi ming to work in the Northwest Union. Wang Enmaoshe must not transfer such a person from his side, he resisted and did not do it. During that time, Qi ming took his bike every day to report to the universities in Beijing. After making the report, he had to take a bicycle back to the station for dinner. So ran for a month or two. He felt too tired and stopped. \\nIn 1955, the Northwest Military Region organized four or five creations reflecting the defense of Yan'an's film screenplay 'The Battle of Revolution Sacred Sites'. When the film literary script was not finished, Zhang Bangying, the third secretary of the Xinjiang branch, was to transfer to Beijing, named to take Qi Ming to Beijing as his secretary, but was unable to transfer to Beijing because the film script had not yet been completed. After the film literary script was finished, he was shot dead by Mao Zedong. The reason is that the central leadership will not be on the screen until it is concluded. Peng's home in Zhongnanhai, please eat the creations group 'revolution sacred site battle'. From Peng's office to his dining room, he has to pass a long open space, Qi ming and Peng always walk behind. Qi ming looked at Peng's sideburns and said, 'Do you have white hair?' Peng said, 'I want to go home as a common people, die, plant an apple tree on my grave...'\\nOn January 20, 1955, the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China presented a report to the CPC Central Committee to carry out criticism of Hu Feng Thought. On May 18, Hu Feng was arrested in jail after approval by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The country has embarked on a struggle to expose, criticize and inventory the 'Hu Feng anti-revolutionary group'. Xiao Hua, director of the General Political Affairs Department, criticized notoriously at the General Political Conference: 'Someone sends burned chicken to Hu Feng!' \\nThe film script creation team began to not mind the criticism of Hu Feng thought, at this time when Hu Feng was arrested in jail, the national inventory, the wind and blows, several of them also hurried to make birds and beast scattered. They saw Hu Feng and did not say anything, but literary worship for literary stars. More than 2,100 people across the country were implicated by the anti-Hu movement, 92 of whom were arrested, 62 were censored in isolation and 73 were suspended for reflection. \\nQi ming returned to the Propaganda Department of the Xinjiang Party Committee and worked in the same room with propaganda minister Lin Bemin. Lin Bemin, Shandong Zhaoyuan, is a branch of origin. And Qi ming grew up in the army. Qi Ming character straight, straight straight will not bend. His house was copied, and his diary about the Baan Hu Feng was found, and all the books were confiscated. In fact, there is nothing written in the diary, actually nothing, just remember that thing. Qi ming said: 'He is the old seniors, just go see it!' \\nIn August 1956, Qi ming published a long poem 'Snow and Snow Qilian Mountain', acclaimed the heroes and heroic martyrs who martyred to liberate the frontiers of the motherland. Published by China Youth Publishing House, the author uses a pen name star song. From 1949 to 1951, Qi ming published poems, essays and film evaluation offices in Xinjiang Daily and newspapers such as Xinjiang Military Region and Northwest Military Region are: Bingge, Yan Yong, Qi Qianming and Lin Xiguang. After 1953, the pseudonyms used in newspapers such as People's Liberation Army Literature and Art, Poems, Yanhe, Xinjiang Daily and Xian Workers Daily are Wenchuan, Star Song and Smile. \\nQi ming, Lanzhou, Xi'an, Beijing, sometimes to Zhengzhou. Xi'an has Wang Wenshi, Du Pengcheng, Wei Gangyan, Zhengzhou has Li Ji and Yu Heding, and a bunch of Lu Yi students. Li Ji also asked him to work in Henan and left him a place in Henan Wenlian. Yu Hedin also said, 'You leave your place, why don't you come yet?' Zhengzhou also has the wilds he knew during Yan'an. Lin Ye's family is the old Red Army, sister is an underground party, every time it distributes leaflets, her sister let Lin Ye help her to distribute. Hayashi squatting across the KMT prison and went to the revolution in 1938. In Yan'an, the forest wild had tuberculosis to go to a hospital dozens of miles away for treatment. No one sent her, Qi ming rushed a small donkey to send her. Later Qi ming went to see her, nothing to take, had to pick a basket of tomatoes and walk dozens of miles to see her. No thanks to the forest wild. Forest wild small, lean. She also loves Ziming. Qi ming has always seen her as a big sister in her heart. Lin Ye's sister later married the governor of Henan Province. Lin Ye later chased that the Red Army, has been unmarried. Qi ming never asked her about her personally. Presumably she was in prison when someone loved her. Later that man died, and her heart died. \\nLin Yoshi Qi Ming marriage bumpy, remembered Zhang Wei, the same room girl in Beidaihe during the treatment. Zhang Wei, Tianjin, is not married in his 20s. It is a propaganda officer of the Communist Youth League at a factory in Tianjin, who can speak and write, every year is advanced, and people are very beautiful. Forest wild on the line to Qi ming. Qi Ming went to see Zhang Wei and knew that her parents were absent, only one disabled brother. Qi ming asked her to review her homework, and she was admitted to Northwestern University. At this time, Qi ming's parents gave birth to a daughter after their marriage in Xi'an, Qi Ming and Zhang Wei. Daughter parents give to bring. \\nWhen the anti-right movement began in 1957, the Autonomous Region Party Committee established an anti-right leadership group, Lin Bomin, Liu Xiaowu, Wang Yuhu, Lin Peng and Qi ming. The person called the 'anti-right' five-member leadership group, propaganda minister Lin Bumin is the group leader, and Liu Xiaowu is the chairman of the Wenlian. Lin Peng was transferred from Jinnan Daily to Xinjiang Daily in the early days of liberation. After reaching the Cultural and Arts Department of the Ministry of Propaganda, Lin Peng dealt with both the literature and culture and education of the Lin Peng is the Director, Qi Ming is an officer and professional writer of the Arts and Arts Department. Lin Peng met when he submitted his contribution. At one time, Qi Ming and Lin Bemin did not know because they had different opinions and quarreled. Lin Bemin said, 'You go to the Central Committee, you go to the Central Committee, ah, uh, I don't have a Central Committee member in Xinjiang!' The central committee, he said, refers to Wang Enmao, who has a hand in the party and government forces. Siming character is straight, but behind never say someone else's bad words. The Xinjiang Military Region opened the conference at the People's Theatre, and the military region tweeted Qi to let him speak. Qi ming said: 'I have nothing to say, what opinions are usually reflected to the party organization!' \\nIn the late anti-right period, some people pulled out the family problem of Saming, saying that he was a class alien, and let him confess clearly. Qi ming once again described the situation of the family, saying that his family composition was misrepresented and could be organized to investigate. In the final discussion of disciplinary action, it was said that they would not be punished if they were not class alienants. \\nQi ming was devolved to Aksu, said to let go to work and exercise, experience life, easy to create. \\n4\\nAksu is 1,012 km from Urumqi. \\nMore than 1,000 kilometers are not far away in Xinjiang, but in Xinjiang in the 1950s, Jiefang big trucks need to travel three or four days. Highway is a simple highway, some places like laundry rubbing board, known as rubbing road, some places are turning the pulp road. The car on the rubbing road is shaking like a vibrator, the car on the pulp road is like a boat in the waves, bumping around. There was no coach bus at that time, but only a large truck with transport companies that pulled goods, could sit in the cab that was high treatment, and most could sit on the materials that pulled in transport was burning high incense. Most of the cars are old and infirm, and the motor 'buzzing' roar for more than ten hours before they can walk 2300 kilometers. If the car is halfway down, it will be more miserable...\\nCars 'buzzing' for a few days, Qi ming came to Aksu. \\nQi ming came to Aksu, and the decision to dismiss him from the party also came to Aksu. \\nHe was shocked when he saw the notice of dismissal. He could not understand how he did not understand that when he himself did not make any mistakes, when he did not attend the meeting, and no leader had spoken to him, and he was totally unaware of the fact that he was expelled from the party. \\nHe wants to complain, but he shouldn't be unhappy...\\nAt the time of his salary, he paid only $186. How did the wages fall? He had compared wages and grades, knowing that his salary had been reduced from 12 to 16. The decline in wages is not clear, and there is no document that says it falls, but in fact it falls. He doesn't know what this punishment was for him? The Party branch secretary of the direct labor department of the district party committee is Wu Shaohua and Wu Shaohua's husband is Lin Bemin. Qi Ming is simple, honest, does not care much about the merit name of Li Lu. The Director of the Department of Literature and Arts of the Propaganda Department is not allowed to do so. He didn't think about these, and his mind was literary creation. He came and went freely and unfettered in Beijing, a while in Xi'an, how did those people think of him? You do not take leave anywhere, do not tell you, party fees are not paid on time, organizational relations do you not want to...\\nIn Aksu, Qi ming was placed in a poor farmhouse in the Humbash Hero People's Commune in Aksu County. Humbash commune is dozens of kilometres from Aksu. The landlord was an old man of Ville ethnicity, named Imin River, two men, and a son. Yiminjiang family four walls. Yiminjiang freed up a room, clean, and Qi Ming spread his luggage on the kang. Without a bench, he used a block of earth to a table, and bought a blue cloth to the commune without cloth tickets, and paved it on it. There was a kerosene lamp in the house, and Imin River asked him every day for matches. Sometimes he pinch a few pieces, sometimes a box, and sometimes a bag. Finally, Qi Ming lighting no matches. Qi ming borrowed matches to Yiminjiang, Yiminjiang laughed, laughed very sweet, said I have I have. Say, get up and get up. The commune sent a cow to Ziming, and le"

Three bowls a day, Imin River is mixed with water in the milk, and the milk iminjiang family drink. Qi Ming knows, but he is not unhappy, and the ordinary people are not easy, so let's go together. During a difficult period of three years, the members of the community also did not eat enough food. Qi ming also taught farmers how to eat willow leaves. Willow leaves, boiling water, put a little oil, mix into stuffing steamed buns. The agent ate a mouthed and said it was too fragrant. \\nAksu builds multi-channel channels and draws manpower from various units. Siming was redeployed to the drainage site. Dozens of people slept in a large house and hundreds eat in a cauldron. On the construction site of the drainage canal, you chased me, with large slogans of 'Encourage energy, strive for upstream, how fast and good to build socialism', 'People's commune good' and 'people's communes are broadcast a day on the radio, songs of 'good socialism', 'our good place in Xinjiang' and the speech of the leadership, the site The situation of the labor competition and the good people that have emerged. Announcer Yego's voice is crisp and sweet, everyone loves to listen. \\nYego's name at this time is Ye Qiuyue. \\nYego was sent from Aksu Meteorological Station. She speaks well in mandarin, and Aksu was an instructor when she hosted the New China Ten Years Festival exhibition. The canal site headquarters looked at the conditions of Yego were very good, and he pulled her out as a temporary announcer. Yego found that the correspondent Qi Ming's manuscript was very good. She also noticed that there were also critical right-wing opportunities in the broadcast manuscript, saying that Qi ming was a leaking right-wing element. Yego was curious. She thought, 'What does the right look like?' Ye Ge let Qi Ming write more manuscripts. Qi Ming wrote the manuscript, Yego broadcast, so Yego and Qi ming knew. Yego knew Qi ming, Yego was a little girl in her early 20 years old. Yego thinks Qi ming is very talented, character is very good, never say false words, talk is also very humorous, not as bad as they say. She thought, 'Is this the right?' \\nQi ming in the labor of repair more lang channels, created a 'song of multiple channels': 'hey-cut earth trowel, pull a silver belt gobi waist wrapped, brought the clear water alas...' the compass song, singing on the site. \\nYego also loves this song. \\nDrainage drainage labor is mainly digging drains and transporting earthwork. Drainage to dig more than two meters deep, dig out of the earth car to transport, can not come out, take a shelf, loading the basket with pulleys to pull up. And the quantification of workers is 29 pounds and a few two oil per month. Labor intensity, Siming's rice volume is also large, less than a pound of quantity a day, and lack of oil meat, he does not eat enough on the site, the belly often croughtered. Yego's rice was small, and gave him her meal. Qi ming came in the donkey truck, the landlord of Hunbash Hero People's Commune. The donkey car sat on the yangzi (wife), of Imin River and his son (son). Yimin Jiang brought pilaf and dried Sang Ren to Qi ming. \\nZiming met them very kind, like he met his older brother. Imin Jiang's face again showed the sweet laugh at him when he borrowed the match. \\nThe time for Yego to take turns labor at the drainage construction site, returned to the unit, Aksu Meteorological Station. \\nAksu's secretary He Jinnan aligned well, and he did not think he was the right. He said to him, We do not want you, it is an instruction from the upper side. But who is on top, he didn't say. He Jinnan saw Qi ming on the street. He ran around him through the street. He Jinnan also let his little granddaughter sing and dance to Qi ming. Qi ming wants to create a literary script. He Jinnan let him live at the local party school, eat to a district office in Aksu town. He also specifically said to the District Secretary: 'He is an old comrade, is a very talented old comrade, don't let him starve!' The district office opened a hotel in Aksu city, and the district committee secretary called Zhao Puchu. He said to the head of the hotel: 'You asked him to eat at that restaurant, and want him to eat even though.' After eating a few days, the hotel leader said to the secretary:\\n'He has a lot of meals, he ate, and we lose money.' \\nZhao Puchu said: 'How much can he eat alone?' \\n'We can't earn money!' \\n'It doesn't matter if you earn two less!' \\nAksu Party School is not far away from Aksu Meteorological Station, one and twenty minutes away. Yego often went to Ziming there. After Qi Ming wrote the draft script, Yego gave him a copy of the manuscript. Qi ming looked at Yege's manuscript, saying, 'The child's word is still good and can see clearly.' There is also a man named Lin Zhuyi who gave Qi to copy the manuscript. He was proofread by the Aksu newspaper. His home is from Nanyang, Henan, and Qi ming is a hometown. \\nAksu Meteorological Station has 30 individuals. Yego's 20 years old, it is the flower season, there are a lot of people who love her. The deputy director also liked Yego. Yego often goes out after work, it is inevitable that people see. He also sent someone to find her. Yego said I was not a child. What did I do? The person looking for her lies that you went dancing, afraid to come back unsafe, the director let pick you up. Aksu also had a bank governor who was following her. Before moving to Aksu, Yego had borrowed the Kuqa County Committee as an instrument at the Kuqa County Meteorological Observatory, and knew the governor of the bank at that time. After she moved to Aksu, an old accountant at the meteorological station held a meeting with the governor. He had to the old accountant bring words to Yego, saying, 'Little leaf, someone said he knew you in Kuqa. He met in Aksu, lived in a certain room of a hotel, so that you could meet once.' Yego listened to it, 'um, um,' two voices, and didn't put it on the heart \\nQi ming loves literature for more than 20 years, read a lot of books, newspapers and magazines published a lot of articles, and also a collection of poems. Yego also loves to read poems. Both people share a common hobby, two people together to talk about poetry, talk about Zang Ke's poems, talk about character shaping, exchange views of reading. Qi ming said he was reading in Yan'an, three or four candles a night, he finished reading 'iron flow'...\\nYego is sympathetic to Qi Ming. Qi ming's family did not hide her, and Zhang Wei's letter Qi ming also let Yego see. Zhang Wei's thoughts are positive, his heart of progress is strong, and firmly loyal to the Party. Every time she wrote, she accused Qi ming, saying that Qi ming did not progress and backwardness. Say a slap does not ring, why people old you? If you're not wrong, will people do you? Can leadership complete you for no reason? Qi ming devolved his labor, and often writes checks, plus Zhang Wei accusations once and again, very grievous in her heart. No matter how to explain to her, she is blame for him. Letters cannot be avoided to drop out, let him reflect, reflect and reflect again. Yege had seen Zhang Wei's letter, angry, felt that her letter was not objective, unreasonable, and thought too paranoid. \\nQi Ming and Zhang Wei returned to Xinjiang shortly after they married in Xi'an. Zhang Wei went to college and gave birth to her daughter during four years of college. At that time, Siming's mother, father and brother were in Xi'an. The daughter has always been carried by Ziming's mother. Zhang Wei seems to be behind Qi ming, and is not willing to suffer to come to Xinjiang. Also, Qi ming's mother has no culture to bring children without science. One time Zhang Wei quarreled with her mother-in-law, cursing the mother-in-law Qi Ming's little brother Qi Bin interpolated, Zhang Wei listened very annoyed, slapped his little brother Qi Bin. Zhang Wei also walked with her daughter and returned to Tianjin. \\nOne day, Qi ming received a letter from the Tianjin Municipal Court, and Zhang Wei proposed for divorce. The court sent a letter asking him that Zhang Wei wants this daughter, you are an old comrade. We can take care of you and give your daughter to you, but I don't know what your opinion is? Please answer by letter. Qi ming read the letter and said to Yego that I haven't seen this daughter after birth, I have only seen the photos, the photos look very beautiful, and also very healthy. Now the court asks for my opinion. Speaking of here, Qi ming paused, and then said, she was also so old to get married, she also liked the child, let her stay, give her a companion. Take it back, but let my mother keep it, and I don't have that ability. Qi ming is like soliciting Yego's opinion, and it's like self-speaking. He has a mature opinion on the daughter's going to stay. Yego, of course, is based on the opinions of Ziming. \\nBefore the divorce, Zhang Wei came to Xinjiang once. When she went to the propaganda department of the district party committee, a person from the propaganda department said she: 'How can you marry a college student?' \\nQi ming met Zhang Wei back to Urumqi and processed a divorce with her. \\nZhang Wei told others that saying Qi ming. \\nmake no words. \\nQi ming met a person from the propaganda department. The man said, 'Oops-Qi ming, you haven't been starved to death yet? We all thought you were starving to death!' \\n5\\nYego is also a bitter man. \\nIn 1937, the Japanese invading forces occupied Nanjing, creating the tragic Nanjing massacre. In 1938, Yego's mother and father fled from Nanjing with his 13-year-old son of uncle and aunt. Run against, is to escape, is away from the Japanese devils bayonet machine gun. Yego was still in her mother's belly. Yege was born after he fled to Changsha. Yego was born on June 7, 1938. A family called her Mao, and her father Ye Zhaochun gave her name Ye Qiuyue. The family went back to Chongqing and Kunming. When he came to Chongqing, the father and his father's brothers and his son Wang's brother did not meet. \\nBorn in 1940, younger brother was born in 1942. His father stayed at the 21 Arsenal, was able to suffer and everything would dry, drive cars, machining, repair. Father also taught uncle technology. Uncle is called Fang Yuxiang. His father found another young, beautiful Miao woman outside Hu Yongqing, and did not go home often. Mother alone with two sisters, and also a big belly, life is quite difficult. One day, the mother had a big belly, holding his brother over two years old, and Yego, five and six years old, pulled his mother's cloths and walked forward. At this time, Yego did not know that her mother was going to send her to the orphanage! In Chongqing, the United States has an orphanage on a small island. Yego saw a piece of water, and a boat took three of them to the island. A lot of houses have been built on the island, and a grandmother said to her mother: 'The host is not there, do not work today, you come again the day!' \\nBack on the boat, brother lying on the boat along the edge of the boat, accidentally dropped to the water. Yego was around him, grabbed one leg of his brother, and was pulled up by her mother. Mother was surprised by a cold sweat. Three people got off the boat and went back. Dark, also very cold, the sheep intestine trail on the mountain bending, always not complete. That way, Yego felt good and far away. She sleepy and really wanted to sit down and sleep. She was still very scared in the heart, she always felt that there were ghosts in the woods, she dragged her mother's coat tightly \\nThe morning after returning home, an old lady of a neighbor asked, 'Where did you go yesterday afternoon and came back so late?' The old lady was from Chongqing, and Yego shouted her 'home'. Hunan, Hubei, the mother-in-law family. Yego said, 'I don't know, you ask my mother to go!' Mom said, 'Send hair to the orphanage!' The family said, 'You can't send her there, and I see only those sent, and never see any coming out of there. Send it to death!' The family also said: 'Shi Qingsheng family has a girl, and she is almost big. Sores of rats have just died soon, his family woman wants to die to live, you should give them home, leave a living life, and you can see her in the future.' \\nYege gave to Shi Qingsheng home. Shi Qingsheng is a Shanghai-man. They changed her name to Shi Xueqin. Yego was just six years old, but she knew everything in her heart. In their house, Yego had eaten to wipe the table. She was low enough, she stood on a small bench; mop the ground and kneel to the ground with a rag cloth. The adoptive father Shi Qingsheng is the child of the landlord's family, a mother who raised him up, a bit of culture. He's okay to Yego. The adoptive mother is the peasant child of everyone, and it is very bad for Yego. Yege was an art committee member of the brigade at school, and her adoptive father bought her a drum for more than one dollar. Yego likes the mess, sleep are holding. Buy it back for two days, the adoptive mother does not want to return it. His family had a son of Bieko, two years old, called Shi Xinghua, who had tuberculosis and spit blood, and none of them told Yego. Her brother, two years older than her, eats eggs and drinks milk, while Yego can only watch and give him blood and wait for him. Chubby Yege thin into a purse bone, without a little effort, end of the dish end of the plate, the plate fell to the ground broken; end a rice, bowl knocked off. A fortune teller has a fortune teller to tell her, see if she can still live? Fortune teller said that she was in the child, the child was locked, and it would be good to grow up. \\nMom helps people to make a little money laundry, with two younger brother difficult day. Uncle wanted to give her mother some money secretly under her pillow. My mother found out, the two people would still quarrel. Yege's brother Ye Shusen followed his uncle, and his younger brother gave his uncle Fang Yu Xiang, named Fangwan. The uncle is a lady who grew up in a large household. Uncle is good to him, my uncle is bad for him. Stenosis of the heart of the uncle, \\nAfter the three children were sent, the mother changed to marry. His later father is Wu Yuzhang. He is the Minister of Social Affairs of the Kuomintang government, but not the famous Wu Yuzhang. Mother gave birth to a sister in Wu's family. \\nIn Kunming, the big brother suddenly lost. Where did he go? The family is in a hurry! \\nIn 1945 the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Yego returned to Nanjing with his adoptive father family from Chongqing. \\nFrom Chongqing back to Nanjing, it was a wooden tug boat. The back of a large ship dragged two small wooden boats. The wooden cabin of the small wooden boat was also equipped with a black car for officials, with a small room next to the aft rudder, dedicated to the owner of the boat. Yego often runs to peek at how they pray the gods to bless everyone. \\nBoat to Jiujiang berm, adoptive mother called Yego with the crowd to buy some ravioli end back. Yego bought back on the springboard, just took a few steps, so the thick rope suddenly broke. The small wooden boat goes down, and the people on board often crying. Yego's hand on the cylinder also scared shaking, to the cylinder also fell to the ground. After drifting 200 meters downstream, the boat was housed by the boatmen below. After boarding the ship saw the adoptive father's leg injury. Yego asked his brother: 'How did Dad hurt?' He told Yego that Dad was stepping into the broken board to see if you fell into the water. \\nBack to Nanjing, one time Yego returned home from school. She saw her adoptive mother and raw mother sitting face-to-face conversation. At a glance, she recognized her mother who was talking to her adoptive mother and night. This is the first time the mother and daughter met in Chongqing. The mother made many pairs of shoes for Yego, woven several sweaters, and gave his brother Shixinghua sweaters. At that time, they lived in the three village of Nanjing bus, and the general visitors were sleeping in Yego's house. But the mother came, the adoptive mother did not let the mother and Yego sleep. Eat breakfast the next day, Yego went to school early. Yego knew that her mother was going, went to the station and she stopped. She knew her mother was going to ride at the station, and she was waiting for her mother there. For a moment the mother came, Yego ran past to hold her mother and cry. Mom also cried stroking the frostsores and frostsores on the hands of Yego after the knot scar. Mother asked, 'How are they going to you?' Yego said, 'Bad!' 'Your big aunt lives in Nanjing Yuhuatai Renjia Garden, you can go to her,' said her mother. Find her, you can also find your dad!' The mother also told her grandfather to be named Ren Jiaci, and also told several cousins names. Yego listened carefully. She did not dare to write these names into the pencil box, but only one word to the wall of the kitchen, and only she knew what those words represented. \\nThe adoptive mother always wanted to figure out exactly what Yego knew if she wasn't her own birth, she held Yego many times and asked, 'Did you pick up the snow?' 'People say I'm not your mother, do you say, don't you? 'Who are you born?' Yego always answered with opportunity, 'I'm not picking it up!' 'You are my mother!' 'I am your own life!' After her mother saw her gone, she asked Yego, 'Who was the mother who came that day? You know what?' Yegodo replied, 'I do not know!' 'I haven't seen it!' \\nWhere did she know that a 6-year-old child had memory. \\nThe adoptive father Shi Qingsheng is the driver of Xiao Tongchi, president of the Central News Agency. Xiao Gong House and Foreign Minister Wu Tiecheng's Wu Gongguan are not far away, and Yege often goes to Wu Gongguan. \\nNanjing was quick to liberate, and rumors were spread everywhere, saying that the Communist Party's communist wife said first kill the pig before pulling hair. Pig refers to Zhu De, and Mao refers to Mao Zedong. The KMT dignitaries all went to Taiwan, and Xiao Tongchi also bought a flight ticket for his foster father's family, so that all the adoptive fathers went to Taiwan. The adoptive parents do not want to go, and they negotiated that we did nothing bad, we were eating with technology, and they did not have to be afraid. \\nNanjing was liberated on April 23, 1949, and a big wolf dog from his foster father's family died on the night of the 22nd. The big wolf dog died and his foster father's family was stolen. Dogs were killed by stolen human medicine. The dog was originally raised by Xiao Tongchi, and he gave it to his adoptive father after he left. Xiao Tongchi lives in a mansion where drivers, doormen, chefs and their chores all live in bungalows. The dog is big, will eat popsicles, do not bite people, but people see are very scared. Dogs are not afraid of self-fear. Summer is too hot, it stretches the tongue, you give it popsicles, it will lick and eat. \\nThe house of the foster father lived near the street. Yego was 11 years old when 'liberated', she stood by the roadside. She watched the KMT army ahead and followed the PLA forces behind. Does she want to fight that way on the battlefield? How can this fight? \\nThe PLA entered the city and Nanjing 'liberated', let his father go to the East China Military Region Teachers College to concentrate on studying. After studying, a job was arranged to stay at the East China Military Region Teachers College to drive. Aunt Ren Jiaqi, a member of the Kuomintang parliament, is also focused on learning. He did not return after attending the study class and later sentenced him to 17 years' imprisonment. Aunt in the garden of the Yuhuatai is very famous, Yego visited once, home glass flower room, please eat are very careful. \\nYe Ge's mother married Wu Yuzhang and gave birth to a daughter. Wu Yuzhang died in a few years. Mom took her daughter to Nanjing Yuhuatai Renjia Garden's aunt's home. The aunt's family's days were not good, and he introduced her mother to a landlord in rural Quanjiao County, Anhui, saying that the person had good character. The people in that village were all named children. Stepfather renamed his sister to Tong Jinmei. Yego hated his aunt's family after knowing it: 'Mother is there, you don't want to feed her. Do not want to feed you don't want to feed, married people also find a little bit better. You did not think, all liberated, the landlord is the fallen class fights every day. It's been 1954, and married my mother to a landlord. Luckily the local people say she was later and did not suffer much of the shock...'\\nOne day, older brother Ye Shusen came to find Yego. Yego gave the adoptive mother a voice and went out. The brother said that his aunt was bad for him, he said he had no place to go and was very lonely. He said that his mother knitted his sweater, sister (aunt's daughter), had no hair rope, the aunt removed the wool from the cuffs of his sweater to be the head of the rope... Brother is going to go, Yego has no money to send him, she has only very helpless opening to grandma Shanghai. \\nShanghai grandma and Yego in the same hospital, is a little foot. Where did her husband work, she was a cadre, married a small house in the field. Every time she went to her husband for the cost of living, she asked Yego to write to her. Yego found Grandma and said to her, 'Grandma, my brother is here, there is no money, I want to send him, there is no money for a ride!' Grandma busy said: 'It doesn't matter, I give you I give you!' Grandma gave Yego five cents, and Yego was grateful. Five cents by car, eat a bowl of ravioli a dime, the money is enough. Yego led his brother, gave him a bowl of ravioli and gave him some money to get him in the car. The car drove away, Yego turned back and walked. \\nWhen he reached the first grade of high school, Yego did not want to go to school again. At school is a class to study, returning home is to work all day. She wants to go out and find a job. She found her uncle's house, and her aunt was there. Uncle is the president of the Higher Society, but not a member of the party, Yego said to him, 'Uncle, I don't want to be in their homes. Their home is not good for me!' The uncle said to the people at the police station, changed Shi Xueqin again to Ye Qiuyue, and an account. \\nYego liked the quiet autumn night, the bleak moonlight had an unspeakable feeling, she also happily accepted the name 'autumn moon'. \\nAt this time, Shanghai Xujiahui Center Meteorological Station was enrolled in Nanjing, Yego registered. Nanjing chose 11 people to study, and Yego was admitted. Among the 11 were repatriated overseas. \\nXinjiang is going to run a meteorological school in Qitai, and Su Zhanshu Bureau of Xinjiang Meteorological Bureau brought an officer to the Shanghai Central Meteorological Station for admissions. \\nAt that time, Shanghai, and throughout the country were singing songs written by Ma Hanbing, 'We are a good place in Xinjiang, ah, good pastures in Tianshan Mountains...' Beautiful lyrics sang the hearts of young people all moved, and the melody also made the young hearts fly up. YegoBen was able to stay in Shanghai, but she wanted to run a little further, and wanted to leave this complex home far away, and he encouraged others, saying, 'We're better to go to Xinjiang...' They also wrote an application. \\nXinjiang recruited 120 people there and sent 70 yuan to everyone to buy clothes for the winter, but we can buy fashionable and beautiful clothes. \\nIn May 1956, Yego and this 200 young heart embarked on a dream road to Xinjiang. To Lanzhou, full of the street fishy, as soon as we see it is nausea vomiting. The team bought them canned bread and bread. The train then reached Zhangye, and changed to the Jiefang convertible. There is no toilet on the Gobi beach, and a few women's circles are temporary toilets. The car was gone for several days and did not see a family. No water, face can not be washed. Also sent big shoes to Xinjiang. \\nAfter arriving in Urumqi, the civil aviation meteorological station urgently needed people. Eleven people from Nanjing ran a training course at the airport. Youth from Shanghai were sent to the Qitai Meteorological School, with their qualifications according to the secondary budget. In the course, Yego's learning is very useful. Not only do you listen to the lessons taught by the teacher but also self-taught. She has excellent academic results. After her completion, she was assigned to the Urumqi Civil Aviation Meteorological Observatory. Kuqa set up a weather station, because Yego was alone, seconded to the Kuqa. Later, she moved to Aksu-and so, Yego approached the same step by step. \\nTwo people with bumpy lives met. \\nQi ming sigh for the deserted fate of Yego's childhood, and Yego also suffered indignation for the integrity of Zi Ming Ning for the jade and not full of full integrity. Two people say anything in one piece, but that is not talking about love to me. Compassion produces love, and the seeds of love are deeply buried in the heart. \\nQi Ming wrote two short novels sent to Tianshan magazine, one titled 'Brawl' and the other entitled 'Fire'. Later Qi ming received the refund. In early 1960, a political campaign to criticize right-wing opportunity, literary and bourgeoisie humanism began. Wenlian first issued some 'negative material' for criticism across the country, and then to contact Xinjiang to carry out a great deal of criticism in journals. At the meeting, Wen Lian Chairman Liu Xiaowu said that 'Tianshan' has any such works, ah, come up and criticize! Participants in the meeting were Chen Baizhong, Liu Jiaqi, Quan Kuanfu and others. Quan Kuan said that Qi Ming, an old writer who had decentralized Aksu rural areas, had written two novels that reflected the huge leap that had overwhelmed farmers and caused disaster. The novel had a tendency to humanize, but had only been rewritten. Liu Jiaqi said he could get him back! Chen Baizhong said this is not appropriate! Liu Jiaqi said that soldiers are not tired of cheating! So by Kwon Kuan wrote the letter, saying that the publication decided to adopt, please send it immediately. Qi ming did not know the fraud, he happily sent back the two manuscripts again. In the March and April 1960 issue of Tianshan, these two novels were published in Qi ming, just with a harsh 'editor's language' and critical articles as a living target for the opposite textbook. \\nSiming suffered again...\\n6\\nIn the autumn of 1961, Qi ming received a notice to him to Kashgar. \\nKashgar is 468 km from Aksu. Siming looked for a convenience car, bumpy for two days to Kashgar. \\nQi Ming knew Li Bo, deputy secretary of the Kashgar Land Committee, and also knew Meng Shulin, secretary of the Land Committee, but had little interaction with him. \\nMeng Shulin, secretary of the Kashgar Land Committee, has long been instructed by his superiors to make arrangements for alignment. Said Sheep Daman commune is the model commune of the land committee, let him create a red flag commune of film and literary script, in order to facilitate the creation, let him go there to deep life, and sent him a letter of introduction: Comrade Qi Ming in order to create, to you deep into life, squat, work, in order to It is easy to create a part-time deputy governor of your commune. \\nKashi to Shule County 8 km, Shule County to Sheep Daman 16 km. Shule County east gate to the direction of Gashi, through 203 troops, ground satellite observatory, to the Yangtman commune. The Yangtman Commune has 16 brigades. Commune secretary Xin Weiwen, deputy secretary Wang Weihan, head of the office, Bumaiti Yiming, secretary Gao Weiyu. The commune compound is a courtyard, on the road north. There is also a house on both sides of the gate, with clerks, deputy secretaries, offices and secretaries on the front side, and offices of other departments on both sides. The house of the secretary and deputy secretary is ensuite, and the outside is the dormitory in the office. Back there is a row of houses, not far from the northeast corner of the house is a vegetable land, not far from the northwest corner is a big dam, next to the dam is a vegetable land. The vegetable area is surrounded by sand dates, willow trees, bushes, and pepper trees on the ground. Eastern and Western dishes are grown in the mouth of the blind flow. \\nOn the south side of the road there are stores, cinemas, farm machinery stations, restaurants, and a large playground for hundreds of people to meet. Basketball games and open-air movies are on that playground. There is no Han primary school in the Sheep Daman commune, and several Han children are attending school at Bayi secondary school in Shule County. \\nStore department is small, only two rooms, only sell some daily necessities, soy sauce, vinegar, matches, kerosene, etc. Most of these people are ethnic Han. The Han ethnic group called the Uyghur people a hometown, while greeting them in Uyghur was called Yordasi. Jordassie is the meaning of comrades. The commune has a big horn, dedicated to an announcer. Or broadcast notices, or broadcast Uyghur folk songs, broadcasts all day long, if you do not understand Uyghur language, it is a kind of mood in the ear, which makes people familiar with the voice of 'Jodashilang', meaning 'comrades'. \\nQi ming took the introduction letter to the Sheep Daman commune. Commune secretary Xin Weiwen has long been instructed by his superiors. The commune attached great importance to the arrival of Jimong, arranged an office in the commune compound and a dormitory in the backyard. The office was equipped with tables and chairs, and he was given a glass plate on the table, and two rows of bookshelves were made in the area to take care of him. And the men of the district and his fellow people were called President Thaci, and he called him chief of Zi. \\nQi ming likes clean, every morning up, with a wet cloth to wipe the window sill, table, chair, bookshelf and so on. He did the same in the years of war. Wherever he went, there were places where conditions were poor and only one plank to write the manuscript. A wooden plank, he will also wash it clean. He has maintained a clean and neat style of life on the troops. \\nQi Ming's new arrival, commune secretary Simviwen convened a meeting of commune cadres to introduce the situation of Sheep Daman. The secretary and deputy secretary, office director and secretary also accompanied Qi Ming to the brigades to take a look. \\nThere are only a dozen Chinese cadres in the Sheep Daman commune, and the rest are all Uighur people.

Qi ming is a life loving person who can quickly integrate into the surrounding masses wherever they go, but sometimes it is inevitable to be lonely. When lonely, he thought of Yego. He wrote to Yego, and Yego received a reply shortly. Yego said she was sick, but it was not a big disease. Qi ming was very anxious, thought that Yego was also alone, sick and no one took care of, he wrote very emotionally. It is written that his poetry is frightly written: '... I wish to be a kitten, always waiting for you...' Finally, Qi ming tentative and tentatively said whether you can come? This place is bitter, no running water, eating is the dam water, the dams float grass debris and livestock feces, there are swims on the water, there are elongated red nematodes in the water; there are no lights here, point kerosene lamp...\\nQi ming told Yego about the actual situation of Sheep Daman, and asked her for advice. In fact, that phrase was a proposal to Yego. \\nYego looked at the letter and thought of the environment of life. Yego is a big bubble in bitter water. She does not care about the bitter, and then bitter, can I live a life that was bumpy and displaced from war fire as a child? Is it possible to live a life like a maiden under the heavens? She decided to go to Kashgar and decided to follow this upright and talented cultural man. \\nYego took a leave, looked for a convenience car, faced the cold wind, embarked on the road to Kashgar. \\nAt Kashgar, she called Ziming. Qi ming made a phone call to Meng Shulin, and Meng Shulin immediately sent a jeep to the three battalion of the Ziqi Automobile to pick up Yego, and sent to the sheep \\nZiming and Yego are ready to get married. \\nSiming bought some sugar and melon seeds, and looked for people to make a few dishes and prepared wine. The wedding was held in Qi ming's office. In addition to the commune's leading cadres and some old people, Yang Liqun, secretary of the county committee in Shulle County, and his love people's affairs department chief Ji Ping and Xia Bureau director of the Public Security Bureau, were also coming. The wedding is simple and lively, the folks say laughing, eating melon seeds, sweets are gone, the rest is a few people from the county. Several people sat at a table and toast congratulations. They toast the bride, and everyone toasts to Zimin and Yego. Xinjiang people drink alcohol, one glass is a glass, a glass of 50 grams. Qi ming young can drink, Ye Ge will not work. She usually does not drink, you have a glass of me toast to her. Hike could not drink but, she had to drink her head up and her neck. I don't know whether it is happy or alcohol attack, Yego drank a 'giggle' straight laugh. She doesn't want to laugh, she only laughs, she can't stop. That laughter is a bit horrible, a little creepy. You can't sit and laugh together. The guest went, Qi tweet came to the doctor. The doctor said it's okay, it's a conditional reflex, gave a little sedative. \\nAfter the next day Yego woke up, Qi ming said with distress: 'Do not drink later!' \\nA few days after marriage, it came to the Spring Festival. \\nThe days of two people are faster than one's day, and the Spring Festival of the two people is sweeter than one's Spring Festival. Qi ming goes to work every day, Yego is at home to clean up the room, or go to the dam after the commune, or turn to the east, or to the western food place to buy a la carte. \\nThe vegetable land belongs to the commune's side team. There are more than a dozen people who grow vegetables, pigs, and beekeepers. Most of them are ethnic Han and almost speak Uyghur. The side team is headed by a 50-year-old Zhang, whose wife is Uighur. Old Zhang sells food, his wife collects money. Sometimes his wife throws his money for selling vegetables into the wall. Later, the renminbi old currency was cancelled. She did not know that the stuffed into the wall was void. Beekeeping is called Tang Qigui, the age is not big, that is, teenagers.

Yego leaned and asked him:\\n'Little friend, what's your name?' \\nHe slowly raised his eyes and said, 'My name is Chen Qiang.' \\nYego asked again, 'What happened to you?' \\n'I have pleurisy and have no money to see a doctor,' he said. A word stopped, a while he said, 'I am uncomfortable, I don't have a little bit of effort!' \\n'I have to go to see a doctor without money. How can I do it if you have a disease?' This sentence is like Yego is saying to him, and it's like self-speaking. \\nChen Qiang, Gansu. In fact, he is no longer a child, he is already the older child of fifteen and six. Just thin and weak seem even more young. \\nBack home, Yego told Ziming. Qi ming then sent Chen Qiang to the commune health hospital. \\nLater, Yego also knew that Chen Qiang family originated landowners. One of his uncle is a revolutionary cadre. He passed to his uncle and left his home to wander to sheep big man alone. He wanted to learn Gorky wandering here, he fell in the commune's vegetable garden, busy growing vegetables, playing blocks, carrying a few books with him, but also wrote something on the book. \\nIn a blazing eye, Yego's family visit holiday for 20 days arrived. She didn't want to go, nor did she want her to go. So it was delayed for some time. When she had to leave, she had several sick leave in the hospital. \\n7\\nYego returned to Aksu Meteorological Station long ago and received a telegram from Kunming. \\nKunming is where Yego once fled, there are her father Ye Zhaochun, stepmother Hu Yongqing, uncle Fang Yu Xiang and his uncle's younger brother Fang Wan. Yego has never seen his father, but also before she remembered. There was no image of the father in the memory of Yego. His father was a driver in a convoy of Chuxiong Forestry Bureau in Kunming. Uncle Fang Yu Xiang was born in 1920 and drove in a fire brigade in Kunming. My mother worked in the Xinhua bookstore, and his younger brother Fang Wan has graduated from high school. Uncle honestly and gracious, uncle savvy and able. \\nThe telegram was sent from the stepmother Hu Yongqing: 'Your father's disease is in danger.' \\nYego is already pregnant. She went hard against her father's sick telegram. Although the father abandoned his mother and his children, drifting a family and causing many misery, he was his own biological father. To his father, Yego has both a hate and a blood blood affection. She sent a leave report to the head of the unit. Leaders also know Yego's life from the files and agreed to visit her family. \\nThe weather is getting hot, summer will be Pro, Yego departs. \\nHis father and daughter met. His father looked at Yego over 24 years old, thinking about his daughter's appearance as a child. He did not believe that the immediate Yego was his hair. The father asked Yego's memory when he was a child. Yego said how some time he was sent to the orphanage by his mother. When he came back, the younger brother still fell to Jiang a little, and also said something about his uncle and uncle to her mother. My father said that it is a time of peace, if I can't recognize you in the years of war: how beautiful you were a child ah, a person on the street did not hold you, who saw anyone likes, you go to play wine without money, people dare to give you credit! Now, how do you become like this? Yege knows that Xinjiang has less rain, drought, sand and sand, and the mantra is sharpened, naturally seems old. The West is not more nourished than the southern air, people also appear young. \\nUncle and father are in Kunming, not far away. Yego lived in rotation with his father and uncle, living with his father for a while, and at the uncle for a while. Both fathers and daughters meet, siblings meet, all delight Yego. The holiday arrived. The holiday has passed. The unit sent a telegram urging her to go back to work. August, September, coincided with a thunderstorm day, the railway landslide from Kunming to Chengdu. Yego could not go back. The unit sent a telegram: see the speed back if you do not press the automatic separation process. Both father and uncle said: Don't go back, you have a culture, the job here is good to find, and promised that they find a job for her. \\nThe father got glaucoma. After medical treatment and the return of the daughter, the father and daughter reunited in a comfortable mood, vision gradually regained a little. Yego and his father also made a joke. Yego worked outside for so many years, saying that he used to 'comrades' both. Once she spoke to her father, she said, 'Comrade, this is not possible!' Father sounded temper:\\n'Why do you call Laozi comrade, and do not respect me at all, are you still hate me?' \\nYego listened, a belly breath and grievance also came: 'It's because of you, why did you find someone outside? Why don't you want Mom and us? Why don't you care about us, Mom can't feed us, just sent me, and gave my brother to others. Do you know how much white eyes I suffered there?' \\nThe father also argued, saying, 'At that time, it was not a Japanese fighter bombing that could not go back?' \\n'Can't go back, money is not sent back?' \\nFather card shell up. \\nYego also said, 'I am ostensible to give a family a daughter, actually a maiden. I wipe the table, the little one is low enough, I move a stool, stand on the stool and wipe; drag the floor, take no mop, I kneel on the floor and rub a rag little by little, you know? Not all because of you, my mother sent me, sent me two brothers, and my mother left again. Did you know I'd die a little bit...'\\nYego cried while saying that the heart's stimulation is like the water of the collapse of the embankment. \\nFather speaks. \\nYego's little mother sneakly listened outside the window, and did not dare to come in. \\nAfter Yego's little brother gave it to his uncle, the uncle was not very good for him either. Although Kunming is like spring all year round, but a rainy day in autumn, the mountain wind is still chilly. October weather, again in rainy days, Yego saw his brother wearing shorts, legs frozen trembling. The younger brother graduated from high school and the railway forces came to recruit, he had to go to become a soldier. He knew that the Railroad was tough, and he was going to...\\nOn November 25, 1962, the eldest sons of Qi ming and Yego were born in Kunming. \\nYego wrote this message to Ziming. Qi ming is very happy. Qi Ming called him Qi Jun, and his little name was Anan. Anan is a transliteration of the Sanskrit of Buddhism. Italian translation joy, festive. He was one of the ten disciples of Shakah, who was 25 years old out of house with Shakah, longer than memory Qi Ming called his son Anan, presumably to take joy and joy. Yego is a learning person, children grow up all day and day, and when her son is more than three months, she enrolled in an English remedial class. She took her son to the class, remembering English notes. Kunming and Kashgar are far away. Yego in Kunming is thinking about Kashgar sheep big man at the western edge of the Taklimakan desert, and the Qi ming of the sheep big man thought about the Yego and unseen sons of the mountains far away from Kunming. Qi ming sent 200 yuan toll, allowing Yego to fly back to Xinjiang. \\nThe 200 yuan road fee, Qi Ming is borrowed to Ding Lang. Siming didn't have money at the time. Although his monthly salary was 186 yuan, his expenses were large and sent to his parents every month. Urumqi has a father, mother, brother and sister family who depend on him. Qi ming is a filial son, he would rather eat less and drink himself every month, and did not want his parents to make trouble. \\nYego mother and son by plane to Urumqi. In Urumqi again looking for a pick-up car to Kashgar. To Kashgar, Qi ming made a phone call to Meng Shulin. Meng Shulin sent a car to Yego mother and son from the station to Sheep Daman commune. Qi ming met Yego's son for more than 4 months, happy. Qi ming happy, of course did not forget the old Meng face. Had he not sent a car, he would have to find another way. He said to Yego, 'This old man is good!' \\n8\\nYego's mother and son arrived, the house of Qi ming was considered home, only got angry. \\nZiming's office and home are connected. The house on the front is his office, and the back is home. Even if off work is not office time, there are often people to find Siming, some people are stepping on the meal. The blind flow to Xinjiang in that era came for a bowl of rice and for a life. Come all want to find a live, mix a bowl of rice. Find Ziming, sometimes they just sit down at the dinner table and pick up chopsticks. Qi ming said to Yego while greeting, 'Go, take double chopsticks!' Sometimes watching their clothes break, Qi ming said, 'Go, get one of my old clothes for him!' \\nShule County Civil Affairs Section Chief Ji Ping often receives blind flows from the Mainland, asking:\\n'Which brigade are you to?' \\n'To sheep big man! \\nAnother question, the answer is still 'sheep big man'. \\n'Sheep big man, sheep big man...'\\n'Sheep Daman' listened much, the people of the Civil Affairs Department were strange, and asked: 'How can the other communes not go to the other communes in Shule County, why do you want to go to Sheep Daman commune?' \\n'There is a chief of Qi, and he is good for the blind flow from his mouth!' \\nThis word goes to Yego's ears. She said we were not really good for them, but they came to us and we didn't think they were dirty. Qi ming said to take a pair of chopsticks, let them sit down and eat; their clothes are broken, torn don't say, sometimes the butt is exposed, Qi ming said, you find him an old dress to wear; the shoes are broken, toes are exposed, he said you take the shoes to let him try to wear Can? The so-called good, that is to say, earmarked funds, do not misappropriate their money, give them relief cotton clothes, ah, whatever can be distributed to their hands. One pass ten and ten hundred, there is more blind flow to sheep big man. \\nHe Shuling went to Shule County, Hou Dongpo, an agricultural technician stationed in the team of Sheep Daman. Hou Dongpo and he came to Sheep Daman in a carriage. He Shu-ying is the first time to sheep big man, people are rusty. Hou Dongpo led him to find the commune's instruments Gao Weibo. Gao Weibo also led him to see commune secretary Simweiwen, deputy secretary of the commune Wang Weihan, and also met Governor Qi Ming. Communal secretary Gao Weibo 20 years old, Nantong, Jiangsu. Although he is a clerical, de facto role is similar to that of the Chief of Staff. He Shu-ying's first impression was that he was not tall, dwarf, charitable, approachable, especially his two long longevity eyebrows surprised him. Having met the leaders of several communes, he started a survey of the use of wheat grass alkalization livestock. Every day two people had breakfast, backpack, or ride donkey or walk to the brigades. Sometimes instruments high maintenance accompanied, sometimes send an interpreter to follow. When he came to the brigade, he asked the main words, sometimes by the way, 'Communal secretary does not come, president does not come' and other gossip words. When it comes to President Qi, folks say that this man is good. \\nHe Shuying, a person from Kaifeng County, Henan, was born in January 1938. In 1957, he was admitted to Xinjiang Bayi Agricultural College Department, specializing in animal husbandry and veterinary medicine. Graduated in 1960 to Kashgar Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry. Hou Dongpo is also a Henanan, who graduated from Bayi Agricultural College, a higher level than him. Hou Dongpo graduated to Kashshule County, Shule County Agricultural Technology Bureau and let him go to Sheep Daman long-term stationed team. Hou Dongpo work dedicated, forgettable. Hou He both were alumni, but they did not know before. \\nHe Shuying in the commune for more than half a month, often met Qi ming, met both sides nodding each other, no more words. Although all three were Henan people, none of them had a close idea of pulling the old people. The turn of gentlemen, work with one heart. \\nIn September 1963, a socialist education campaign in rural areas began throughout the country. On December 4, the Kashgar Land Committee issued 'Instructions on the Implementation of the Directive of the Central and Autonomous Regions Party Committee on Socialist Education in Rural Areas'. The Kashgar Land Committee met for the deployment and the establishment of social and educational missions under several task forces. Lu Zhanbin is head of the team, Qi Ming is the captain of a team. Subsequently, the whole rural area launched a rectifying society movement centred on socialist education. \\nA team of social education teams has seven or eight people. Social education team members need to work off-site, can not work in their places of work, try to avoid. Qi ming conducted social teaching in the town commune of Shule County. Ye Ge went to the county to see her son. He met Yang Liqun, Secretary of the County Committee. Yang Liqun saw Yege, remembering what she had said to give her a job, said, 'You have nothing to do at home, there is culture, and there is no people here. You will start teaching society first!' Yege was reluctant to be at home, was also happy to work, and participating in social teaching could often be in one piece, and he promised full of mouth. \\nTeaches in the countryside, sometimes by one person, or two. Xinjiang is vast and large. A county is hundreds or even hundreds of kilometers from a county, and a commune is also tens or hundreds of kilometers away from a commune. From the station to a brigade is sometimes far away, and the transportation is to ride donkey or horse riding. Yego would not ride a donkey and borrowed a bike. Uyghur folks mostly don't know their date of birth, and you ask him what age or when he was born, the answer is paradoxical, or say, 'I was born when peach blossoms' or 'I was born when I was eating melon.' Their ages are all extrapolated. The team taught them not to eat more, and to be honest. Qi ming sometimes brought an interpreter, and Yego gave them a record, counting some numbers. The captain of a production team eats much more, and the team wants to replace him. When consulting members of the production team, the members did not agree to replace him. The Task Force asked them:\\n'Didn't he come to the production team privately to get food?' \\n'Yes, he was selfish to the production team to get food!' \\n'Didn't he eat much more?' \\n'Yes, he is eating much more!' \\n'So eat more than account, why not let it change?' \\n'Well, they're all like lice and bed bugs, and we all fed them. If you change another one, he's still hungry, doesn't he have to eat our flesh and drink our blood?' They say. \\nAs soon as the Task Force listened to, these words from folks also make sense. As a result, the captain was later secretary of the brigade. He wanted to shoot Yego's horse fart, quietly measured the foot of Yego's son Qi Jun, and made a small pair of leather shoes for Qi Jun. But leather shoes are still small, can only look can not wear. Yego gives him money, he does not pick up anyway. Qi ming knew about this, he scolded Yego a meal: 'How can you look like this, how can you just want people's things?' \\nIn the urban commune, Yego is pregnant reaction period, especially want to eat green apricots, want the sour taste of green apricots. After each old hospital house is planted a lot of apricot trees, tired green apricots hanging full of branches, no effort to reach out. Ye Ge dare not reach out. When Qi ming saw Yego's mouth moved, he doubted that she had eaten apricots, and scolded Sometimes Yego also grievances. During a meeting of the Social Education Task Force, Lu Zhanbin, head of delegation, walked to Yego and pulled her hand and asked this to ask, what level is Qi ming's level and how much salary? He is an old Red Army, with a relatively high salary, and he shows off how much his salary is, and he also says something different. Yego was very disgusted to him, and he said to Qi ming when he returned home \\nYego sometimes also embraces the Qi ming, when liberation is 12, more than 200 yuan of money, more than a decade, the salary is not long, but somehow fell to level 16, became more than 100 yuan. When referring to the salary, Qi ming said to her: 'I'll say to you, if your money is not enough, you take my money and spend it, I don't spend anything, I will smoke one or two cigarettes a day. We want to be more politically than we look down in our lives. You see that farmers work nine cents a day, aren't we much stronger than them? Only in this way than you can think of open, life can be happy! Several movements within the party have not also wronged a large number of people. Some people have even died wrongfully. Wouldn't it be a blessing for me to survive?' \\nZiming advised Yego so, but his heart is sometimes depressed, but he doesn't say it. \\nZhou Bowen, a member of the Arap Brigade, is a blind flow from Tianjin to the frontier, and can say it. One day, he aligned his statement: 'Chief Qi, you come to our house this afternoon to eat a little meal?' 'We can't eat someone else's meal,' said Qi ming. We also let others expose people who eat much more, how can we go to your house to eat your meal?' And he said, I do not give you any meal, and you eat whatever we eat. You go and try it!' At that time, Yego was damaging the doll, and wanted to spit once Qi ming wanted to let Yego change the taste. So they went with him with pleasure. To see there, eat the noodles of barley noodles, thick and thick, with a leaf or two camma mushrooms inside. Zhou Bowen gave Yege full of a bowl, Yego ate a bite, touch his teeth, squeaky ringing, dare not close teeth. Qi ming saw that Yego was difficult to swallow, he said to Zhou Bowen that you should not flourish, and I would eat her bowl. And the black ones that they eat of Kahang Naan can't pull down their stool. Zhou Bowen has two or three children. His wife grows very beautiful, is also very stable, does not love to speak. It doesn't look like Zhou Bowen's little 'oil' flavor in Tianjin, talking to blow the beat. Zhou Bowen wanted them to experience his life. \\nOn the way back, Qi ming said to Yego, What is it called to eat and live with labor, this is to eat and live with labor. Only then can you experience their lives, and only then can you say that they are suffering with them. Yego also realized that the white Nan and Buagu naan in the team cafeteria were still very good. \\nZhou Siyuan in the Social Education Task Force is a freshly graduated student from Xinjiang Medical College. He knows that Qi ming has a culture, and he wants to run an exhibition, and he said, 'President Qi, I will take pictures. I think of your team, you put me on!' When Qi Ming promised, he was put up. Qi ming runs a social teaching work exhibition. Zhou Siyuan's eyes myopia, the focal length is not good, shines more than a hundred films, not a good one, is all flowers. Qi said to Yego: 'This kid really hates, give me back a favor!' \\nThe toilets in rural southern Xinjiang do not discriminate between men and women, even in brigade sites. The man went in was a male toilet, and the woman went in was a female toilet. When someone came and coughed, people outside knew that the people in the toilet were men and women. One day, Qi ming came back from the toilet against the wall, with a white face, white was scary. Yego saw his face wrong, and asked you what? He said you went to see! \\nYego went to the toilet, and saw the blood on the stool, and covered all the stool. On that day, Zhou Siyuan was also in the house of Qi ming, and when he returned, said to Zhou Siyuan, 'Small Zhou, you also go and see!' 'I said to you, you don't be afraid, it may be hemorrhoids.' Yego told him, 'The blood of hemorrhoids should be wrapped outside the stool, and his blood is covered. Since then, zimus often bloody. Go to the doctor, the doctor prescribes a hemostasis. Yego took him to the hospital, with a colonoscopy of 30 centimeters and saw more than a dozen bleeding points at 17 centimeters. Diagnosis is: hemorrhagic colitis. \\nDoctors say inflammatory bleeding of the colon is also associated with mental depression. \\nYego knows that Ziming is very unhappy. \\nBut Ziming never said. \\nTeach in Arap commune, Chiming and Yego lived in a homeland with their son, Anan, a year old. One night, Qi ming and Yego met in a brigade far away to put their son at home and instruct fellow people to help take care of it. The meeting was late and went a long way, and when he arrived home, Yego heard the crying of the child's heart and lung tear. Yego frightened to run to the house, ran back to the house for a look, the child fell under the kang, the child sprinkled a urine on the ground, crying like a tear, tears, urine and earth on the ground became mud water, all over and down like a mud monkey. Yego distressed to pick up the child and sit there cry...\\n9\\nAfter Chan Qiang's pleurisy cured, the body recovered quickly and continued to fight dirt in the vegetable garden. Earthpiece is a very tired job, after a day of work, he does not rest, he ran to Jiming's office to look for a book. He stood in front of the shelf and looked for a long time. At the beginning of the social education, he actively cooperated with the team to expose other people's stealing of vegetables. Qi ming looked at him cleverly, knowing that it was not but clear and evil. He was not so proudly spoken, and acted as Sven, and acted steadily, and recommended him to be a commune as a correspondent. As a correspondent, 25 dollars a month. After Chen Qiang became a correspondent, he had more time in and out of Qi ming's office. He was happy and satisfied that he was able to read in front of Ziming's two book shelves every day, which for him was his university. He wants to become China's Gorky, and he wants to be China's Bronky. He gave Qi ming that your bookcase against the wall is not good, books prone to tide moldy, better to move the bookshelf forward, left behind a blank can ventilate. After Qi Ming agreed, he sought help to move the bookcase and left a walkway behind. Chen Qiang put a chair in the aisle, and when he was fine, he sat inside and read books silently. He read the book very late, sometimes Yego forgot a person behind the bookcase, he burned water and washed his feet and ready to sleep, then Chen Qiang cough after the bookcase, was a reminder to Qi Ming Ye Ge: 'Don't forget, there is still a person in the house, uh!' \\nQi ming live is a suite, front is a large office, the back is a bedroom, behind the bedroom and a backyard. Qi ming's large desk, put a glass plate, the glass plate on the reading of books and writing paper, also put cloth tickets, food tickets, sometimes off work, Qi ming put a watch pick on the table. A blind stream took his piece of table, and Ziming did not find. The next day that blind flow sent the table again. He said, 'I struggled for the night, and I did not have to take your table, and I brought it back to you again. I think you're so good to us that anyone can steal anything from your house, I can't steal it!' After this sentence, he paused, and then he said, 'Chief Qi, I give you another opinion. You don't put food stamps, cloth tickets and money on the table or press under the glass plate, so we can easily take...'\\nIn Sheep Daman commune, people's chickens are often lost, but Qi ming family things never lost, no, his family also lost a chicken. The next day of losing the chicken, someone told Yego that Tang Qigui stole a chicken from your house and put it in several brigades. As soon as Yego heard Tang Qigui, he went to the brigade to get the chicken back without delay. \\nTang Qigui is also a blind runner to the sheep big man. The age of Chen Qiang is a little stronger than Chen Qiang, but is two different types of people. He kept bees in the commune, and usually sneaky dogs. He put the beaten honey to sell it in the store department of Ka Sakae (pseudonym). Tong Hua Rong is the wife of Wang Weihan, deputy secretary. Children's Flower Rong will sing mountain songs. She and Wang Weihan were on the mountain song together. \\nOne day, Zhou Bowen came from Arap to the family of Sheep Manziming, and Yego gave him a meal. Siming looked at his pants rotten, a patch on the ass flashed and exposed skin. Then he asked Yego to find him a trousers for him to put it on. Eat, he slapped his breasts and said, 'Big brother!' Yego listened, busy saying, 'Small week, do not shout like this, you shout him as well as the chief of the district, and shout his old Qi, or shout him as well!' Zhou Bowen, like I did not hear, still said: 'Brother, I don't have other skills, I will make curtains, will use wicker baskets, and weave well, very beautiful. I'll walk, I'm a scud, you let me send a letter or something, and I'll walk in a few hours...'\\nSpeaking of going, Qi ming heard Zhou Bowen's meaning, he was thinking of sheep big man to come. Qi ming promised, just organized several people to sell money with the straw curtains. \\nYego is not used to see Zhou Bowen this kind of blow-blow, pulling and pulling look, aligned and said: 'Old Qi, the next time he shouted you again, you are a little serious, don't let him shout your big brother', that does not affect you well! He said he was coming from Tianjin, and he didn't know why he ran out, in case there was something, you can't say it!' But Zhou Bowen seems to have no memory, he always said that, and the more people he said, the more energetic he said. \\nKlimu Township sometimes sent a basket of apricots to Qi ming, and sometimes others sent a fish to Qi ming. Siming asked Yego to give them the money, saying, 'We are wage people, and the ordinary people are not easy!' Klem is already a 70-year-old man. He didn't know when he was a township chief, and his fellow people called him Governor Krim. He had been to Beijing to meet the world, his prestige was high, he walked on the road. Uyghur fellow, young and old, all respectfully bowed and cared to him hello. \\nAlthough Qi ming came later than the secretary and deputy secretary in the Yangtman commune, but people in the commune had anything to say to Qi ming. Once, the old Lu from Dongcayuan led his daughter Lu Wenhua to find Qi ming, and t"

Wang Jiuli a look at the door of the market department locked. What does she want Mom to do at the store by locking the door? The door of the store department is placed a kerosene bucket, Wang Jiuli standing on the kerosene bucket, grilled the window glass on the door to look inside. She saw Tang Qigui in her mother, and she shouted, 'Tang Qigui, you bullied my mom! You bullied my mom!' Lu Wenhua listened to Wang Jiuli shouted, he said let me see Lu Wenhua stands to the kerosene bucket for a look, Tang Qigui is lying on Wang Jiuli's mother's body. She told Dad when she came back. Qi Ming listened, and said, 'Hey, what do they know about a little child?' And asked, 'Did you say to others?' Old Lu said: 'No!' And he said, Do not say to others again. Speaking of the impact on her reputation, it is not good for the leadership. Little kids don't have real evidence.' \\nSimvivan worked in the Sheep Great Man commune, and his wife was in the county and only returned to the county on Sunday. Sometimes he was lazy to cook, he went to the Qi ming family to rub the meal. The summer director of the County Public Security Bureau came to Sheep Daman and often went to the Qi ming family for dinner Qi ming's guns were very accurate, and Han cadres in the commune were equipped with guns (recovered during the Cultural Revolution). Ziming's gun was placed under the pillow, and Yego was also afraid of fire. Qi ming said that as long as you don't move it, you're fine. Xia Bureau director and secretary Simviwen several of them went to test their guns. Qi ming shot down two crows. They took home, and Yego stewed two crows with most bottles of oil, added powder, and made a large plate of dishes. All colors and scents, looking at glutton. But end to the table, Qi Ming did not eat, Simwewen and Xia Bureau did not eat either. Yego saw that several of them did not eat, and she did not eat either. A few people even clamp a chopsticks to taste. After a meal, Yego asked Qi ming: 'Why don't you eat?' Qi said, 'I have a block of disease in my heart!' As soon as Yego heard her heart, she knew Qi ming had come to Tibet, had seen heaven buried, crows often ate decay. A plate of meat can not be drained, Yego remembered the correspondent. \\nAt this time, Chen Qiang was no longer a correspondent in the commune, and he went to work elsewhere, if his salary of 25 yuan was too low. Yego went to shout correspondent Ma Guosou: 'Ma Guosou, you come to our house for a trip!' After Ma Guosou arrived, Ye asked:\\n'Do you eat meat not?' \\n'Eat!' \\n'What if the crow meat you don't eat?' \\nHe said, 'Can you eat or not?' \\n'Can eat!' \\n'Then sit down and eat!' \\nMa Guosou ate a plate of crow meat and also ate two or three steamed buns. Yego asked him, 'Meat is not good?' \\nHe said, 'It's too delicious! I've never eaten such a tasty meat!' Yego still blame himself after listening: 'How can we not eat it? Is the little bourgeoisie thought weird?' \\nThe Political Committee of the Southern Xinjiang Military Region Zeng Guangming let Qi ming go. \\nZeng Guangming, born in 1917 in Ji'an Oilfield Township, Jiangxi, participated in the Peasant Red Guard in 1930. Kudai Hyperlink 'http://baike.so.com/doc/5333749.html\\\\\\ t '_blank' Ji'an after joining the Red Army. Participated in five anti-' siege' times, overcome the difficulties of left-arm injury, stomach disease, malaria, climbing mountains and grass. It was the old Red Army who came from the long march road. \\nQi ming went, the two people said a few words, Zeng Guangming left the office for reasons. A document on Du Peng's disposition was placed on the coffee table in the office. The document is a document within the party, and it was intended to let Qi ming know this information. Qi ming returned to Yego said, 'Old Du made a mistake!' \\nYego is about to fall. Qi Ming made a phone call to Zeng Guangming. Zeng Guangming immediately sent a jeep to transfer Yego to the 12th Hospital of the Southern Xinjiang Military Region. \\nOn December 24, 1964, Ziming's second son was born. \\nQi Ming named him Qi Tao. For he was born in the sheep Great Man, he called Amman, and Little Man. \\n10\\nAt the end of 1961, the Kashgar district party and political organizations, like the whole country and across the country, began to streamline institutions and reduce the urban population. By the end of 1963, the whole Kashgar area had cut down 5,282 workers, reduced the urban population by 83,994, 83,510 foodstuffs were reduced, and the number of decentralized workers and urban population 85,994 were placed. The people who were devolved to the Sheep Daman commune, together with those who had flowed blind to Sheep Daman, formed a farm brigade of over 100 people. The farm brigade in the southeast of Sheep Daman commune, there is a simple road leading there, about 6 kilometers. Yego only knew three or more people including Qin Deming, who had put down to Sheep Daman in the city. Zhou Bowen was also in the farm brigade \\nThe commune also established a salt farm. The salt farm is next to the western food ground behind the dam. \\nIn early 1966, Yego was pregnant again. \\nQi ming's 'winding set' Xinjiang people's publishing house is ready to publish.

Lin Bomin asked: 'Hey, old Qi, what have you come to Urumqi?' Qi ming told him the matter of modifying the book. After his knowledge, Lin Boemin sent a document to the publishing unit, saying that Xinjiang now has a shortage of paper, and publishing is always directed to national comrades. Lin Peng specifically called Lin Bomin on Qi ming's book and asked, 'What do I do about Laoqi's books, the pictures are plugged in!' Lin Bomin said, 'Han's older brother, should be more national-oriented. He will figure it out. His book says later.' Lin Peng was very angry, and said Qi ming: 'You have a lot of words, don't you say modify the manuscript, just look at your mother?' \\nSiming does not lie. \\nAt this time, Qi ming's parents were in Urumqi. \\nIn 1952, Qi ming came back and brought his parents and two brothers and one sister to Xinjiang. My sister Qi Xiuwen married a section director of the old eight road, municipal health bureau. He was an outstanding party member of the district party committee and later promoted to the head of the municipal health bureau. After Qi Xiuwen went to Xinjiang, he took a literacy class, learned training, and worked in a pharmacy at the Grand Cross Hospital. Parents first lived with Qi ming in Urumqi, and then with Qi ming to Xian Tibet Bagou. After graduating from Xi'an University, he was a teacher at Bayi children's school, and later went to the municipal health bureau tuberculosis hospital. After Qi ming delegated Aksu in southern Xinjiang, his parents lived with Qisin in the family hospital of the Municipal Health Bureau. Little brother Qi Bin joined the army in the early 1960s and was active. At the time of the Cultural Revolution, he was already an advanced member of the Xinjiang Military Region studying Chairman Mao's writings. In the early 60s, Xinjiang Military Region outpatient department needed an old Chinese medicine, Qi Ming's eldest brother Zhang Bingzheng brought his big sister Qi Tiqiu also came to Urumqi. \\nYego went to the salt field when it was okay to help them work. Salt factory has eight workers, factory director buy Maitijiang, Nie Dingbo couple, Wang Qianhua couple, you Xiang Xiu couple and Xu Dequan. You Xiang Xiu and Yego age are about the same, Fujian people speak the southern language of Fujian and Cantonese. He married an Uighur university student who graduated from Kashgar Normal College. Others said he: 'You want to think well, wow, you have to be bad for her, and later divorced, she has no way back!' \\nSheep Daman has a blind couple from outside the field. Men are from Shandong, named Liu Dongshan, and Yang Liping, a woman, with two sons, rented a hometown house, carrying a camera for a day to take pictures. One day, Qi Jun, nearly 4 years old, ran home with a picture and said to her mother, 'Mom, aunt photographed, aunt photographed.' Yege took the picture, knowing that Yang Liping gave him the photo. \\nYe Ge Hui old three times hurt, especially want to eat MSG. Sheep big man's store and no MSG sold, Qi ming please translate riding a horse to Shule County to buy a bag of MSG. \\nOne night, when Chen Qiang went from Yecheng to Sheep Daman, the night was already deep. He knocked on the door of the house. After a while he spoke to Ziming, he pulled out a bottle of Maotai wine from his arms. At that time, a bottle of Moutai wine was four pieces, compared with nine cents per labor day was still very expensive. Qi ming said how did you earn money outside? Chen Qiang said I earned money from earning dirt. Qi ming heard, the tears fell immediately, he said: 'Children, you are earning more hard money outside, you don't have to eat yourself, you still buy this wine to do!' Chen Qiang said, 'It's my mind, I know you love to drink a little wine!' Qi ming said, 'Do not do bad things outside!' \\nChen Qiang read almost all the books on the shelf of Qi ming books when he was a correspondent at Sheep Daman, and Marx's 'Capital Theory' he also read. Later, he stumbled about 25 yuan a month for less money, and he quit the work of the correspondent to the outside. \\nChen Qiang everywhere looking for work, one day there was no money in his pocket to buy food, he ran to his fellow orchard to eat apricots for a day...\\nAt the beginning of 1966, the General Political Department of the PLA met to implement five principles of 'prominent politics', saying that 'the highest instruction' 'sentence is truth', 'a sentence of ten thousand sentences', 'highlight politics in one hundred thousand' and 'with spiritual achievements, it will certainly be possible to produce material results'. In March, the CPC Central Committee approved the Minutes of the Troops on Literary and Artistic Work in April, and the Political Bureau Expanded Meeting was held in Beijing in May, and the 'Five Six Notice' of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), was adopted, and the 'Ten Years of Unrest' curtain opened. \\nThe Notice demanded that 'exalt the banner of the proletarian cultural revolution, completely expose the bourgeois reactionary positions of the anti-party anti-socialist so-called 'academic authoritation', criticize the bourgeois reactionary thinking of academia, education, the press, the literary and the publishing world, and seize the reactionary thinking of the bourgeois in these cultural fields Leadership in. To do so, it must simultaneously criticize bourgeois representatives in the mixed progressive party, in government, in the army, and in the cultural sphere, to cleanse them, and some mobilize their positions. In particular, they cannot be appointed to lead the cultural revolution'. For they 'are a group of counter-revolutionary revisionists, and once the time is ripe, they will take power from a proletarian dictatorship to a bourgeoisie dictatorship.' 'Our struggle against them can only be a struggle in which you die and live. Our relationship with them is definitely not an equal relationship, but one class oppresses another class, that is, the relationship between the proletariat dictatorship or dictatorship over the bourgeoisie.' \\nOn May 17, Kashi Land Committee secretary Meng Shulin made a speech entitled 'Actively participating in the Proletarian Cultural Revolution' at the party members and members of the district (city), level organ party members and cadres, thus unveiling the 'cultural revolution movement' in Kashgar area. \\nOn July 26, 1966, three sons of Qi ming were born. \\nQi Ming named him Qi Hongbing. At that time the Cultural Revolution had begun, the Red Guards, Red Soldier organizations had emerged throughout the country. \\nBefore giving birth, Yego put the boss Qi Jun in the farm brigade Zhou Bo Wenjia. In September, Red Guards all over Kashgar went to the streets to break 'four old' (old ideas, old culture, old customs, old habits). Yego also thinks that his name Ye Qiuyue has a windy little bourgeoisie mood, and renamed 'Yego'. Ge, an ancient weapon, also implicitly she waved the old forces of old ideas, waved straight against Wang Enmao meaning. She also wants to fight conservative forces to the end. The Cultural Revolution, by definition, is the revolution of 'cultural people'. The Notice speaks very well. \\nQi ming became the 'reactionary academic authority'. 'On the top' also sent Qi ming's reactionary material to Kashgar, sent to the sheep big man. Qi ming put down where, the upper material will follow where, like the shadow. \\nThe commune demanded that people who eat food commodities should go out of their homes and participate in labor reform ideas. Yego holds soldiers to the salt field to work every day. The salt farm director bought the sale of Yego tube salt field, he thinks Yego is a good man and reliable. \\nSomeone asked Qi Ming: 'Zhou Bowen is not your relative, he said you're his big brother. In the name of your son, he went to the vegetable garden to get food and fruit. Siming is a little angry. Qi Jun's fingers were rolled into the tractor's belt, and Yego borrowed a bike to the farm brigade to see his son. When Qi Jun met her mother, he pulled his mother's hand and said: 'Mom, when I didn't see you, my fingers hurt well!' Yego asked: 'Now it does not hurt?' Qi Jun said: 'It's not hurting now!' Yego was distressed, and no longer dare to put his son into their homes, he took Qi Army home, no matter how difficult it would have to pull himself. \\nThe Commune Revolutionary Committee was established, and the Commune Instrument Gao Wei was appointed Director of the Commune Reform Committee, responsible for the 'Cultural Revolution' of Sheep Daman. Commune secretary, deputy secretary and deputy president are all hanging names, but they are people who stand by side. Something, let's meet to solve the problem, all right at home waiting at any time. Before the liberation of Simviwen during the Kuomintang period, it was a radio station in Gansu County that shake a transmitter. He was said to have worked well in the Taohe and became the radio director He was the man who went to the Six Sections of Public Security. Deputy secretary Wang Weihan culture low. Although the two of them were contradictory and noisy, but he and Simvion were little noisy and big help, and when neat, the two people were consistent. \\nAll the brigades sent young activists from various squads, with small red flags lined up with slogan to the commune, bringing together all the people who eat goods and food in the commune together. Those who put on the charges were hanging signs and wearing high hats at the front of the parade. On the side of the parade holding the red flag constantly raising their fist and shouting slogans Crowded people of all kinds of crimes went to various brigades to go to the streets. \\nQi ming is a 'reactionary authority' and 'leak the right-wing elements', and Yego has also been extended to those guilty. Made her a high hat. Yego saw the high hat on a stomach and said, 'What does this have to do with me? I'm not in power!' She's going to take it to tear Qi Ming said to her: 'You silly, the outside is snowing ah. Don't you wear a high hat without getting wet by the snow? Do not be against the masses, it is not their business!' \\nDuring the street tour, Yego also held five or six month-old soldiers in his arms. Some blind people take their children over and hold as soon as they see this situation. When the child is urine, he stuck the newspaper into his pants as a urine pad. After a brigade of Qi ming, Yego, a brigade, a brigade, Yego took over the children, and his pants were wet, you can unscrew the water. \\nCuriously, the street tour team never saw the children's flowers. \\nFlower Rong is Gansu people, handmade noodles do well. She often sat several young youths at the table, eating her handmade noodles. Qi ming also said Yego: 'Alas, you are not as good as Wang Weihan's wife will be around people, she can bring a bunch of young people around her. You, don't be too high. Now that comes, we're going to play with the local people!' \\nChildren's flower Rong born ingredients are not good, people who eat commodity food, only she is not. Why? Everyone has a question mark in their hearts. Originally, a tour of the street, children's flower Rong got 'internal news', her door was locked. \\nWhen the masses pulled together, he was honest, let him bow, he bowed his head, and let him bend over him, and never resisted. Some say he is the big right who has leaked the net. He said you think about it. Can the big one still leak the net? \\nWhen Yego was battered for the first time, some people criticized her nonsense, and the director of the salt field buys Mateijiang up to repudiate them. Yego couldn't make sense for a moment, fainted the past, unconscious of personnel. Buy Tijiang and take her back home. Yego wakes up to feed soldiers. After his son had eaten a few mouths, he didn't eat it again. She looked down, and her son's mouth was blood. How did she think there was blood in his mouth? She wiped his mouth with salted water with her handkerchief, wiping his gums, and blood in her mouth. Yego was scared, and again squeezed his nipples, and blood was flowing inside. She was scared. Ask the doctor, the doctor said you were impatient, blood stagnation, failure to convert. Yego went to the commune to buy the milk and sell the milk said you were black cubs, not to sell it. The child did not eat milk. At that time, they stopped paying the same salary and reduced the supply of food commodities, and only 10 percent of the fine grain per month. Yego helpless, only to sift the valley noodles finely, and pack the valley batter for his son to drink. For a long time, Bing thought that the best drink in the world is the valley batter, the best thing to eat is the valley noodles. \\nOnce again, Douyego, director of the Cultural Revolution, Gao Weibao said a word, and the interpreter should translate this word into Uyghur. When the translator hasn't translated this phrase in the past, Yego used Uyghur words: 'Yoda Silang, Gurganche, Gurganche!' It means comrades, he says fake, fake! Everyone laughs after listening to haha. Yego said, he also gently stare at high maintenance. In front of Yego, Gao Weipao is, after all, a child. Gao Weibo also laughs. Speaking that he was not strong and had to leave the venue quietly. \\nA worker in the salt field, home has a military blanket. He is afraid that the Red Guard plunges his home and wants to put it to Yego's house. \\nMore than 12 o'clock a day, people who work in the communes have not seen Manager Yang to work. They went to knock on his door, and finally pushed the door into a look, on the ground: Manager Yang has committed suicide. Before liberation, he was the manager of Kashi Warsaw Fabrication Company. His wife's name is white and is said to be very old. When she was told to come to collect the body, his wife said that I did not take the body, that he was desperate from the people, and I wanted to draw the boundaries After that, she came to take his watches and valuable clothes, wrapped in a reed seat and pulled into the wild wasteland. \\nAt that time, Qi army was over five years old, he played with the Uighur Barang a day, and could understand their words. Sometimes, he played outside and saw the team holding his fist and shouting slogans from his house with a small red flag. He hastily ran home and said, 'Mom and Dad, a brigade is going to fight you again! Hurry to load the food ticket to the body, put naan on the body!' \\nThe cultural revolution was the whole people of culture, so the Sheep Daman commune began by pointing his head at the beginning. The Propaganda Department of the Communist Party Committee of the Autonomous Region also sent materials and notices to list several parable stories of Qi ming as poisonous grass. Although Simvivan is also a powerful fundraiser, he is also very active in his neat struggle. One day, under the grape frame of the commune, he gave a meeting to the activists of various brigades and communes, laying the instructions on the top of the home, saying that Qi ming family had great poisonous grass and nudity paintings. Those of the Uighurs who did not know what nudity painting was called, they asked. Then Simvion said, 'It's just the butt painting.' Uyghur fellow listened, all shouted with consternation: 'Feed the River-', 'Surprised' outside the meaning of 'feed Jiang' is: 'How do you still engage in corruption and decay, but also have light butt like?' \\nQi Jun heard, ran home to his mother and said: 'Mom, Uncle Xin was at a meeting, said mom's light ass photo...'\\nSimvivan was there to create rumors, incite ignition, divert the fight. \\nQi Ming has written several fable stories, one of which says a group of ducks swimming in the pond, and the fox aunt swings around. The duck says:\\n'Aunt Fox, Aunt Fox, Did you see our mom?' \\nAunt Fox said, 'See, see!' \\n'So where did our mom go?' \\n'Your mom went to heaven!' \\n'So how can we go to heaven to find our mom?' \\nAunt Fox opened his mouth with his fingers and said, 'You jump into my mouth, and you find your mother!' \\n... in this parable story, District Party Committee Propaganda Minister Lin Beminfei said it was a sand-shadow attack on him. \\nThe house of Qi ming is full of books, piles of the ground, and on bookshelves. Red guards came to Qi ming home. Search everywhere in the house, look eastward. Yego said, 'What are you looking for? I will find you!' They say that you have poisonous grass in your house, cursing the parable and naked paintings of his superior Ye said, 'How do you know that it is poisonous grass?' They said, 'The Propaganda Department says it's poisonous grass!' Yego said, Do not look, I know what you are looking for, and I will take it for you. \\nYego knew that they were looking for a human sketch and a parable story written by Xu Beihong for his wife. \\nAs a result, not only were those fable stories and Xu Beihong's human sketches taken away, but also the books, photos of Qi ming and Yego, and the family genealogy of the Qi ming family were taken away. Criticism also said that Yego and Qi ming stinned, saying that Qi ming was a filial son of the landlord class. \\nThe commune's yard is full of large print newspapers. During the day, Qi ming and Yego were either working or pulled to the various brigades to show the streets, and they wanted to go and write their big print during the day. So they waited until the day was dark before they went to see. They were holding a flashlight. The battery in the flashlight ran out, it was not visible, and they looked at the match. Red guards met and said that they wanted to burn the big print and used this as an excuse to hold a critical meeting. And they were stationed red guards in their outside house, watching them day and night. \\nQi ming and Yego felt the grim situation and were ready to burn something. \\nBeginning, Yego was preparing to burn the poems and letters that others wrote to her when she was young, saying, 'These letters have no benefit, nor do they respect them. People chase me, they are the power of their own, they are young people!' Qi ming does not let her burn, said: 'Do not destroy those, in the future, when I write this novel, it may be a reference.' \\nNow they both have to burn. \\nWhen it was burning, the red guards who were living outside the house to supervise them heard, saying that you still burned things, so they swept out their house and let them move to the new house of the tractor station. The house was built more than half, has not been completed, the window of the house is not an glass, the wall mud in the room has not been dry, when it comes to early autumn and winter, the outside of the cold plus moisture in the house, covered with quilt warm is not hot, the child crying...\\nAt 34.00 in the night, the correspondent Ma Guosou came to call Qi ming's door and said, 'Chief of Qi District, Qi District, get up and see the play!' Qi ming asked: 'What do you see? We do not look!' Siming continues to sleep. Ma Guosou called again, saying, It is the time for you to go out! Qi ming said: 'What's going to say tomorrow!' \\nIt turns out that this day, Wang Weihan went to the 16th team, and the road was not coming back. Tang Qigui calculated that this evening there will be something to happen between the children's flower rong and high maintenance. In fact, he went to the deputy secretary's house quietly. When Tang Qigui saw Gao Weibao went to the house of deputy secretary, he found some national cadres of the commune, public security commissioners, administrators and directors, as well as the handlebars of the carriage, and surrounded Wang Weihan's front and rear windows and doors. The high maintenance and children's flower Rong caught a right. \\nThis is a big thing. \\nThe director of the Cultural Revolution, Gao Weibao and Children's Flower Rong want to drink enemy fears to commit suicide. How did Simviwen advise, neither of them listen to them. Helpless, Simviwen personally came to knock on the door. \\n'Old Qi, you get up!' \\n'What thing wow?' \\nSimvivan said the matter briefly, and said, 'Because of your high moral standing, you exhorted them. They all listen to you!' Because both are tied up, they want to commit suicide. Qi ming knew that it was not trivial, he hurried to wear clothes. Yego said, 'Don't you go, do you forget how they were our whole? It is good to die, to save the country a little food, when we go to the dead, use it and sweet words, you will not pretend to say you can't go!' Qi ming said: 'This is the big thing of life, we are all small things, sooner or later will always clarify, it's okay!' Yego is still unhappy to go, Qi ming said, 'How can you look like this? Writer's mind is bright and bright, can all be opened to the world, what sneaky chicken dog can't see people?' \\nNot long after this thing, Gao Weipao went to Kashgar. Xin Weiwen, Wang Weihan and Qi ming three were at the meeting to study production. \\nThe phone rings. \\nSimvion picks up the phone. The phone was called from a guest house in Kashgar, ask:\\n'Is there any one of you called Boy Flower Rong?' \\n'Yes, there!' \\n'Is there one called High Wealth?' \\n'Yes, there!' \\nAfter that, the other party said two people opened a house in Kashgar. After Shinviwen listened, he said nothing, he handed the phone directly to Wang Weihan. Wang Weihan asked what happened, the other party said. Wang Weihan listened, face a burst of white and red. The other party hung up the phone, and Wang Weihan also took the microphone. Half genius said, 'Fucking, net smeared my face!' \\nQi ming returned home and said this to Yego, 'I've seen no face, but I have not seen such a face!' Wang Weihan did not have any prestige in the commune. Under this, Yego was a little happy and curious, saying, 'Don't you say that the children's flowers will be surrounded by people? Is she so surrounded?' \\nTang Qigui also went wrong. \\nShule County Bayi school, a sister looking for a sister to find the doorman room. The doorman room is closed, sister sewn across the door to the door. Sister shouted when he saw the doorman was raping her sister. In the case of the doorman, several young girls who often went to the doorman were taken to the twelve hospitals for examination. Among them are Wang Jiuli, the daughter of Flower Rong. Tang Qigui is implicated in this matter. Tang Qigui was handcuffed by public security officers. Wang Weihan saw from home. Tang Qigui also pulled out the money and cloth tickets in his pocket to Wang Weihan. \\nTang Qigui was sentenced to nine years. \\nQi Ming depressed, 'colitis' relapsed, and Yego sent him to Urumqi for hospital transfer procedures. \\nSpring in 1967 soon, Qi ming with his eldest son Qi army ready to Urumqi. When it was about to leave the sheep big man to Kashgar, the never sick Qi army suddenly launched a high fever. The intention to depart had to do. After a week, Qi Jun was sick. When you're ready to go again, the little son has a fever again. Another week later, Qi ming took his eldest son and Yego to Kashgar with his younger son. They stayed at the hotel for one night, and the next morning they got sick again: dizziness, vomiting, spit a pillow. They did not come to the airport until the afternoon. At this time, Yego suddenly found the forehead of Qi Ming did not know when there was a round red purple circle, size such as silver dollar, such as cupping after cupping the mark left. \\nYego said, 'Old Qi, you go to Urumqi this time, more and more!' \\nQi ming said: 'Oh, how many years have you been working in the revolution, you're like a rural women's humane family. How many years have you been with my old cadre, you still superstition?' \\nHe did not believe it, he took his eldest son Qi Army on the van he was looking for from the airport. \\nYege held three sons soldiers back to the sheep big man. \\nThe car of Ziming sat walked more than 200 kilometers to Bachu when it broke down. The car dragged back to Kashgar repair, only then 'buzzing' roar toward the autonomous capital, toward the political vortex, towards the black lacquered iron gate...\\n11\\nIn January 1967, the Shanghai rebel group seized the power of the party and government in Shanghai. In February, some old handan expressed strong dissatisfaction with the wrong practices of the Cultural Revolution, and the struggle against criminal activities that framed the persecution of old cadres, the chaos party and the army was accused of 'February revolt'. In April, the criticism of Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping's 'crimes' began. The revolutionary storm of 'seizing power' quickly spread across the country. Party, politics, military, organs, factories and mines, enterprises, schools, newspapers, radio stations, and even families are full of opposing two ideas, opposing two views, and opposing the two factions. The husband and wife turned into hatred, conservative and rebellious, revolutionary and counter-revolutionary, divided into two camps of conservative and villain. Seizing power and rebelling power, no water and fire, thou die and live, and not wear heaven. The street and alleyways weigh a team of parades, the crowd in front of the red cloth, holding a "

				"memoirContent": "big red flag, everyone's arms are wearing a red sleeve, holding a red red book, small red flag, the arm shouting 'revolutionary innocence, rebellion reason'. Square rally, a red ocean, slogan, treble horn shocking. The country's major cities, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, provincial capitals and large, medium and small cities are all over the country. Revolution, big series, big debate, big print newspaper full street stickers, flyers flying, everywhere in 'beat, smashing, grab, grab, grab' in a chaos...\\nQi ming came to Urumqi, first sent the boss Qi army to his parents, to the affiliated hospital of Xinjiang Medical College. \\nDr. Wang Shizhen of the Medical School examined him and diagnosed as 'nonspecific colitis'. He also told Qi ming that the disease is related to diet, and also has a close relationship with long-term mental depression. \\nQi ming was admitted to the hospital. \\nQi ming was admitted to the hospital, but his heart cares about national events and the politics of Xinjiang. He has instinctive abhorrence for dancers wearing masks on the political scene. Every day eating, he went to the square to see the big print. Someone familiar with him saw him and asked, 'What are you doing to Urumqi?' Qi ming said: 'I come to see a doctor!' \\nIn the early days of the Cultural Revolution, Wang Enmao was still in charge of politics, throwing Wuguang and Zhang Xiqin out to achieve the loss of the car. Later he went to Beijing for a meeting, and the situation in Xinjiang was not controlled by him, and he was also the target of knocking down. The Cultural Revolution in Xinjiang is divided into two battalions. Wang Enmao is a key watershed. He is like a watershed: the one who defeated Wang Enmao is a villain, called the 'three new'; Bao-Wang Enmao, is the crown faction, called the 'Three Fortune'. The organizations of 'rebellion' and 'royal' across the territory are not the same, but they fall under these two flags. In April 1967, Bannong Red Flag of the rebel organization entered the People's Square, and detained Lin Bemin, secretary of the district party committee secretary and propaganda minister. Put him in the Badong 'Red Flag House' and let him deal with questions. On May 15, conservatives, citing the villain to seal the Xinjiang Daily, organized tens of thousands of people to 'sneak' the 'square assembly war' during the night, and the villains were driven out of the People's Square. \\nThe opposition group found Lin Peng, the former Director of the Literary and Arts Department of the Ministry of Propaganda, and asked him to write the material of critical propaganda minister Lin Bemin. 'I introduce you to someone who knows best about Lin Bemin,' said Lin Peng. The two of them were working in one office, the table to the table, face to face... this person is Siming.' \\nQi ming looked at the big print newspaper on the street, and was invited to the Badong Animal Husbandry Building by the Red Flag of the Eight Nong, and asked him to write materials \\nQi ming hasn't moved the pen, the situation changed steep. With the support of the Xinjiang Military Region 'Urumqi Area Stopping Force Command' (referred to as Wujian), Xinjiang Red Guard Headquarters jointly 'traffic red flag' attacked eight nong and other villain bases. Headquarters informed everyone that everyone went back to prepare a few days of dry food. Qi ming went home to buy a few kilograms of biscuits, to go when two sons holding his legs to eat cookies. He said the biscuits could not be eaten, and they were taken as dry food. When everyone does not eat, they can eat, is ready for urgent use. The mother also said, 'Lonsie, you don't go!' And he said, How can I not go? \\nQi ming carries a pocket of cookies out of the house. \\nGo to Nanchang Road, he heard the treble loudly shouting: 'hurry, hurry, 100,000 fire, eight nong headquarters is besieged, the switchboard has been smashed...'\\nSiming speeded up the pace. \\nOn the night of June 23, many soldiers mixed in the conservative team to complete the encirclement of eight Nong. Dawn attack, first attack the animal husbandry building, and then under the agricultural college building. In the afternoon, the rebels came to support, conservatives retreated and preserved the Red Flag House. Nearly 1,000 people were injured on both sides and arrested more than 200 villains. The rebels will also command the attack against Badong Military Region Deputy Chief of Staff Masen, Deputy Secretary General of the District Party Committee Niu Qiyi and Red Guard headquarters commander Ma Fenglian captured. \\nYego alignment is very unhappy: 'That place is already in a hurry, what else do you do? How are you so dead? Do you know how many sins we have suffered for you?' Qi Ming said, 'I am an old cadre. I can't look at them when I go; when they are in distress, I will not go! I can't betray them. What is a traitor, if it doesn't go, it's called a traitor!' \\nThe three strongholds of the eight Nong Red Flag, the animal husbandry building was first attacked by 'three hurts', and then attacked the Agricultural College Building. \\nSiming was caught. He was one of the more than 200 people caught. \\n'Three hurts' people look at his appearance extraordinary: a short, strong limb, flat face, English force, eyebrows thick and long, short hair such as mane roots such as thorns, a large character style. Someone recognized him: 'Isn't this martial light?' 'Yes, it is martial!' Someone who mistakenly thought he was Wuguang, 'three promotion' people happily run to complain, saying they caught Wuguang. Wu Guang is the third secretary of the Party Committee of the Autonomous Region and is a big figure. \\nThis day was June 24, 1967. \\nThis day is an important day in Xinjiang's Cultural Revolution, known as the '6.24 event'. \\nThe leaflets captured by some of the leaders of Bannong Red Flag were quickly affixed to the streets and alleys of Urumqi. \\nQi Jun, son of Qi ming 5 years old, saw the leaflet on the street and saw a picture of his father on the flyer: head low, eyes closed, two hands tied by chains. The people who watched also said, 'Siming is dead!' Qi Jun heard that his father died, tears fell down, crying home and said to grandma, 'Grandma, Grandma, they all say my dad is dead!' Grandma listened to the flyer along with Qi Jun. \\nAfter being caught, he was blindfolded and pulled to a factory closed. When taking pictures of the masked cloth a bit unveiled, strong photographic light thorns him not open his eyes. So it looks like a dead man. His brother Chisin enquired everywhere, and he could not hear about his brother's whereabouts. He thought his brother must have been a fierce Dogi. He sent a telegram to Yego, Kashi's sister-in-law, 'Prepare for the aftermath.' \\nYego received a telegram, returned to sit in bed with a hand holding the child, a hand show to see. When she saw the nine words 'brother sick quickly prepare for the aftermath', the heart was gone God, holding one hand of the child somehow loose, the child dropped his hand to the ground. \\nYego saw that the child fell to the ground before he came back to God. Pick up the child, think about it: the people at home are in that place, let me prepare what afterthought? Preparing for the aftermath is also you ready! I can't buy a coffin and send it to Urumqi! So she wanted to go to Kashgar first in the name of sending eggs to her classmates at Kashgar Airport. \\nYego simply packed up, holding the child with eggs to Kashgar airport to find her classmates. \\nEggs sent, she folded back to Kashgar. Who are looking for in Kashgar? Yego wanted to come and go, thought of Xu Tan. \\nXu Tan works at the agency. His wife is called Maqin. Originally, he often went to Sheep Daman commune, and asked Siming to buy him oil and buy flour or something. Find Xu Tan's family, sleep to his house, and the children have to eat. Very troublesome family, Yego's heart is also very unconscious. The next morning, Maqin said, 'Let's go to the exhibition?' Yego held his son and followed the Maqin towards the streets of Kashgar. Next to the Board there is an exhibition hall, and she goes with Yego. Maqin may know that Qi ming had happened, and consciously dumped Yego away. For the first time, Yego was not thrown away. Yego saw her go far, he hurried up his footsteps to keep up. The second time he wanted to throw her, Yego realized and was no longer following her. \\nQi Ming was caught, everyone knows. Social chaos, everyone is self-endangered, and no one wants to suffer. \\nYego is not familiar with Kashgar, do not know what to do, holding the child sitting on the roadside of the roadside stone. The two factions of Kashgar are fighting, and people are afraid to go to the streets. Street wolves, few pedestrians. When she was sitting there, she heard a familiar voice: 'Hey, how are you here?' She looked and hello to her someone she was familiar with, was Cheng Ping. \\nCheng Ping, the director of the post and telecommunications office, was delegated from Urumqi to Kashgar. He taught Yego and he knew. \\nAnd he said, Alas, Yego, what are you doing here? Did you see the flyer of Old Qi?' Yego said: 'I came to see the flyer!' And he said, 'Do not be nervous, do not cry, I read countless times, I studied it many times! That's what mass organizations do!' \\n'Where did you see that flyer? I want to take a look!' \\n'In the yard of our unit. Go, I'll take you!' \\nYego followed Cheng Ping, a long way from the Big Cross, to the yard of the Post and Telecommunications Office. The leaflet has photos of Ziming, instructions, and photos and descriptions of others. Low head, eyes closed, no spirit, like a zombie. Yego did not know that Qi ming was dead or alive, and tears flowed down at once. \\n'You do not cry, you rest assured! I think this was done by the mass organization. You see his handcuffs are irregular? Like the iron chain of sheep tied cattle.' \\nYego is ready to go back to Sheep Daman to get some money, get some food tickets, then go to Urumqi, and take a bus to Shule County. Seeing the tractor of Sheep Daman commune in Shule County, she got on the tractor. Think this is quite smooth na. She looked for an empty space in the tractor's bucket and saw that the tug contained so many dishes. He thought the commune was selling dishes. Why did he buy so many dishes? She didn't know, she asked the person sitting in the car. \\nA fellow who understands Chinese said to her: 'Buying these dishes is to prepare for a general meeting to criticize the Chief of Qi, and after criticism, you will be sent to the top ten teams to work.' After that, he added: 'The commune was so decided.' \\nAnother man looked at Yego holding the child, laughing and said, 'Do you still go back?' Yego said, 'What happened?' 'The commune is preparing to hold a general assembly, informing elderly people up to the age of 70, children from the age of seven will come to the commune to open the assembly, saying that the Governor of Qi participated in the fighting. After the meeting, everyone had dinner. These dishes are ready for cooking!' \\nYego asked, 'Is it true?' He said, 'It's true.' Then he said, 'Do not go back! They all met, so decided.' Yego realized that the situation was critical, immediately holding the child down the tractor. \\nYego went down the tractor and rushed to the bus station. There is also a man behind jumping off the tractor to chase her. And shouted out, 'Hey-where are you going? Why don't you go back to the sheep big man?' Yego head did not dare to go back and run towards a bus bound for Kashgar. When the man was chased, she had taken the child into the car. The car started, and the man looked at the car after a dust smoke permeated...\\nYege came to Kashgar Sinotrans to find Chen Xiuying. Chen Xiuying has worked in the farm brigade in the Yangtman commune. Her lover is also a head of villains in the Department of Foreign Transport. And he sent a car that pulled the licorice, so that her two were sitting in the cab. A sack and sack of licorice piled on the truck are as high as the mountain, they still free up two holes in the middle and let her two children hide in danger. The car went to Aksu and stopped at a five five cafeteria. \\nIt turned out to meet people who set up a chuck check. Those people were holding a spear and wearing helmets. \\n'What is your point of view?' \\nYego is also thinking about what 'they' is? Yego can't judge what point of view 'they' is, the answer is slower. Yego had to say, 'I am a family member, I have no job, I don't know what point of view?' They said, 'There is no point of view is and thin mud. How is there no point of view? And the thin mud is worse!' As soon as Yego listened, this was bad, he pinch the child's ass. The child creaked wala cry. The driver also said, 'She's a family, what point of view is not? She has no culture and doesn't know what the Cultural Revolution is!' Another man wearing a helmet with a spear said, 'OK!' Just let the car go. \\nThe car arrived in Urumqi, and Yego did not dare to go home. \\n12\\nSiming's father and mother and Chisin live in one piece. \\nQi Xin lives in a family hospital of Baihuacun City Health Bureau in Urumqi. There are more than 20 households in this family hospital, most of them with three points of view, and a head of three. Chisin is 'three new' and is a minority in this yard. Ye Ge is afraid to go back to the festival, only come to the Xinjiang University where Qi Ximiao's native nephew Qi Ximiao is located first. \\nXinda is the stronghold of the villains. It is known as the government of the villains, and eight farmers are the military region of the villains. \\nQi Ximiao's father and Qi Ming were uncle brothers. His father was Huang Cheng's teacher. He came to Xinjiang through Huang Cheng. \\nYego made a man to bring his believers to Chisin, and the two met a face outside. After staying at the New University for a few days, Chisin left Yego to the tuberculosis hospital. The Tuberculosis Hospital is also a small settlement for the villains, where many people live. \\nIn the Cultural Revolution, the two factions are not two sides, you die and I live, the husband and wife, the father and son feud, some do not dare to go home, they concentrate in a place to live in order to act or avoid the splendour. The TB hospital frees up the office for everyone to live, and sleep on the ground without a bed. Most are medical staff. Oman is over two years old, and Yego has not seen children for more than a year. The child saw her strange, hiding next to grandma. Grandma wore a big placket, he stood next to grandma and pulled the placket and sucked on the buttons on his grandma's placket. \\nYego looked at the little man, a sour. \\nQi Xin, smart, mild, is a guy, very human. He is also a small head of the 'three new' villains. After hearing his brother was caught, he was also very anxious. The son of Qi Ming's sister working in the army is a 'three' point of view. He knew people in all walks of life and asked many people to hear about his uncle's news, but nothing was gained. Qi Bin was an activist in studying Chairman Mao's writings in the army. When he was preparing to do so, his brother had an accident. This affects his way: no accident early, late, paradoxically in this dry section of the eye! As a result, he was nagger about his brother. \\nYego went out during the day to inquire about Ziming's news, and write the material of the petition at night. Yego find Limpon. Lin Peng said Qi ming was a veteran. He has seen one side after arriving in Urumqi, but now he doesn't know his whereabouts. \\nQi ming's wages stopped, Yego came out and did not bring more money. Boss Qi Jun was with Grandma, she took Manman and soldiers. The two sons of Tehihan were particularly flattering, and anyone who met wanted to hug. There are also many people who help her. All the people there called Yego a sister-in-law. The canteen administrator said: 'Big sister-in-law, you have nothing, you come to help me count the meal tickets?' Yego knows that a large bucket of rice tickets, and they don't count them. They asked her to take a little meal ticket to save her immediate emergency. Wang Dongming's girlfriend, Xiao Sun, saw that Yego bought all vegetarian dishes, she bought meat dishes every time. She had to change it with Yego, saying, 'This dish is clean, let's eat!' It seems that she bought meat dishes for Yego's son. \\nThe army was infected with tuberculosis, and Chissin's lover, Golden Ling, served as a nurse in the hospital of the Autonomous Region. Yego asked her to give her some medicine to treat tuberculosis, and Jin Ling refused. As a last resort, Yego only bought his own medicine, every day to give the child a needle. It is good that the treatment is timely, it will not be cured long. \\nYego wrote the petitions material, modified several times, and after writing, ready to go to Beijing for the petition. \\nYego hugged soldiers to the train station. When getting on the car, Qi Ming's sister Qi Xiuwen and his brother Jin Ling Jin Ling came with Qi Jun. \\nQi Xiuwen said: 'Your sister-in-law, you go to the petition, there must be a lot of difficulties on the way. You hold soldiers and soldiers, and the milk is not enough for him to eat. What to do with an accident on the road You're better to give soldiers to Jinling, let Jinling raise, you take the army, on the road can also give you a companion, say something, sometimes you have something, he can also give you care of something!' \\nYego listened to it, it also makes sense to think about this. All brothers are bonded flesh, and we are sipers, and the soldiers in whom are not all nurtured? So I didn't think much more, he handed the soldiers to the Golden Tomb, and took the army into the car. \\nThis day is July 24, 1967, which coincides with the first birthday of soldiers. \\nYego went to Beijing for an appeal. In order to save money, he did not buy direct tickets, but went to Beijing one stop and one stop. \\nYego departed from Wu city, first to a brother's family in Xian Qi ming. He and Qi ming were a grandfather, ranked the old two, Qi ming ranked the old six. Yego called his two brothers. Two brother Qilongao, home to three people, brother and sister there is a daughter Qi Xidong. Two brothers were born landlord, who was a company leader of the Kuomintang, was the object of transformation, by pulling the board to spend the day. His nature is kind, and the people around him are particularly respectful. After Yego lives, often accompany the Ergora board. Long Gao pulled in front, Yego pushed in the back. Xidong works at a pharmaceutical company in Xi'an Dongguan. Yego and his two brothers went to Xi'an Jiaotong University to inquire about the situation of the Xinjiang Cultural Revolution. Two sister-in-law is a typical image of housewife. When Yego just arrived at their house, he was anxious, unable to speak, and hoarseness. Two brothers rushed to buy herbal tea, a few days later. Second sister-in-law and Yege were the first time they met, she said: 'My brother, you stay not rush, Qi ming is my life-saving man, that year I had a serious illness, almost died, a drug Xi'an could not find everywhere, it was sent by air after Qi ming bought from Beijing. The drug is expensive, and no money...'\\nYego lived in his two brother's family for two months, and the chaos in the fighting was slightly stable, only the two brothers let Yego go away. \\nYego went to Zhengzhou, lived in three brothers (uncle), Qilong family. Three brothers and three sister-in-laws were very kind to Yego, when he left, afraid of Yegolang, gave his own coat to Yego, and gave back 30 yuan. Three brother's three son, Qi Xibo, is a teacher in the Department of Mathematics at Zhengzhou University, younger than Yego. When he sent Yego to the train, he called six moms long and short, Yego was embarrassed and said to him, 'Can you call my name Yego, don't call the six mother, okay!' He said, 'Which line...'\\nAt Zhengzhou University Qilong family, Yego got the address of Qilongjie at Beijing Normal University. \\nTo Beijing Yego lives in Zilongjie's home. Qi Longjie, a brother of Qi ming, is a professor at Beijing Normal University, but the two do not know each other. Yego lives in his house, his pockets are very strained, go out every day to come back, can only bring a little food. Zilunj's son said, 'Aunt, aunt, how do you still live in our house, why don't you leave?' \\nOne day in the street, Yego saw a big print. The contents of this big print are about Liu Xiaowu, Secretary of the Xinjiang Federation. He said that Liu Xiaowu had once come to Beijing for a meeting with secretary Zhai Disheng. Liu Xiao no live is a suite, others go to him, the door is not locked. That man went in. Open the door, is touching Liu Xiaowu and Zhai Disheng in the bed love of men and women, opposite the wall is a 'spring palace map'. Liu Xiao Wu said to the person: 'You saw nothing... after I...'\\nZhai Disheng committed suicide in the Cultural Revolution. Some say Zhai Disheng suicide has nothing to do with Liu Xiao. \\nLiu Xiaowu is a secretary of the Wenlian, and has been presiding over the Xinjiang cultural community. In Xinjiang literary altar dominates. Work is also particularly harsh, work, even open the door to the corridor spit a bite is afraid he heard. When he heard someone opened the door, he asked, 'Who?' Others scared to shrunk their head back. Luo Shaowen once gave him an assistant. He said he was also very good. After he helped him complete the necessary work, he told him that you should not follow me all the time, and you would do your own business! \\nYego did not know how many days he waited in Beijing before waiting for a reception at the Central Cultural Revolution reception station. \\nYego was met by a PLA cadre. After carefully looking at the material she wrote, he called the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Military Management Council. \\nHe said, 'Where is this man now?' \\nThe Xinjiang Military Control Council said: 'Let's check it!' \\nAfter checking it, said, 'Now in the Detachment!' \\n'As far as we understand, Qi ming is not a fundraist. He grew up in the revolutionary team since childhood.' \\n'He was suspected of taking part in the battle!' \\n'You guys quickly find out!' ...\\nA phone call was made for two hours. The PLA is said to be the secretary of Prime Minister Zhou. \\nAfter that, he wrote a certificate to the Autonomous Regional Reform Council. Let Yego return to Urumqi and handed over to the CNRC. And said, 'When you go back, do not rush to get out of the same. In the detention centre, he is also relatively safe. Once it comes out, it will be discovered by another faction, and the consequences are hard to say.' \\nYego also said that Keke withheld our payroll tickets. We had not issued a salary and food ticket for more than a year. When we came to Beijing, we only brought 36 yuan, and we had no money to buy the tickets to buy back. People at the Central Cultural Revolution reception station said: 'I write you a article. You hurry up to buy a ticket to Tianjin. There is the last train to send a series of students to Xinjiang. \\nAt the end, the PLA passionately asked a sentence: 'Tianjin has Zhang Wei. What is her relationship with Qi ming? She has also come to appeal, saying Qi ming is a good person, not a counter-revolution! \\nYego gave a brief explanation. \\nYego bought a train ticket to Tianjin with 2 blocks of 7 cents. Carrying his son on a train bound for Tianjin. Just got off the train and saw a train going to Xinjiang. Yegora looked for the Civil Affairs Bureau in the streets and alleys. After finding the Civil Affairs Bureau, the people of the Civil Affairs Bureau said: 'The trip you just left was the car for Xinjiang, you missed it. So, I'll write you a note, you go to the shelter and let them think about it.' Yego took the strip and found the shelter. She looked at the people there were all dirty and dirty, the clothes on her body were broken shirts, and the lice in the clothes fell down. They are queuing to buy meals. Yego could not eat that meal, and brought her cadres to see her difficult look, and he got them to the canteen where they were eating, and gave her a note, saying we could only stop one stop to send you forward. In the Cultural Revolution, one of the rooms of the hotel was four times apart. Each room has a bed, a small table. Yego was walking on the street with his son army. The army saw an apple stall, and the army said, 'Mom, Mom, are you hungry? You're going to be hungry. You buy an apple. At this time, Yego wanted to come, from the morning until now, he hasn't eaten. It's already four o'clock in the afternoon. \\nOn the street, the army saw toys that they had never seen in Xinjiang. He was very curious and he wanted to see. Yegora holding his hand does not let see. Look, what do you want? You don't even have travel costs on your body right now! Army says:\\n'Mom, do you not love me anymore?' \\nYego said, 'How can Mom not love you?' \\n'You bought this for me. Why don't you buy me now, and I don't even let me see it?' \\nYego's eyes contained tears, saying, 'Children, now we have no money, wait for money, Mom will buy you!' \\n'Mom, I don't buy it right now, let me see it for a while? I have the money, I buy it again!' \\n...\\nIn October 1967, Yego took his son to Lanzhou. Hami fighting, two factions fought to kill a train driver, the driver went on strike, and the train was stopped. Yego knows that pocket money needs to save a little spend. In Kannai, you can take the articles of the Central Cultural Revolution and find the Civil Affairs Bureau one stop by one stop and come to Xinjiang, he can't take it out. Once taken out, it will not only be confiscated, but also life is in danger. So Yego is scared, try to spend less money on her body. \\nThe weather in Lanzhou has been a bit cold. Yego find the shelter station. The people at the shelter said you could lead your son to dinner. But she couldn't eat that meal. She did not dare to go to the shelter. She bought a kilogram of Yulin wool and was ready to send her son a sweater while waiting for the car. She found a hotel and lived with a female cadre. Female cadres saw the wool, they picked up to see the color of the wool. Yego wondering if she wants to sell it a little higher price, you can also get a few more bucks in her pocket. Yego said that I bought it from Beijing, 24 yuan, a kilogram, or a ticket. If you want it, I can sell it to you. She wanted, Yego sold her. Yego thought I would not lie to someone in my life. I'm really sorry to do this thing. But in that kind of helpless situation, it is only trying to do everything to find a little more money. To others, really can't pull down that face! \\nIn Lanzhou Civil Affairs Bureau, Yego made a borrower and borrowed 30 yuan from them again. \\nAs soon as the train was opened, the reception station bought a train ticket for Yego. The train ticket was bought by an old man in line for her. At the train station, the old man found Yego with a ticket and said, 'Go yourself, I will not send you on the bus.' Yego thought: 'I sold the ticket to buy another ticket from the previous stop, not save another ten bucks?' Yego delivered the ticket to the window, the teller said, 'Is your ticket not the old man just given you?' Yego said, 'Yes, that is the child his grandfather!' She bought another ticket to the previous stop, and then she had 16 yuan more money in her pocket. \\nTo Hami, two factions in fighting. On the train, a representative will be sent to the villains. Someone let Yego be representative, she dare not to be the representative. After that, the letter written by the Central Committee Cultural Revolution to the Xinjiang Cultural Revolution she never dare to come up again. It took two days in Hami before the train started again. \\nGet off the train to Urumqi, no train tickets can not be out. There are mass organizations with spears everywhere at the station. Yego saw their legs trembling. She pulled her son and continued along the railway line. She wanted to get out along the railway. \\nThe son said: 'Mom, Mom, you're wrong, you go wrong, the exit is not there...'\\n13\\nYego came back from Beijing with the army, first came to the new university, explored the situation before he returned to the family hospital of the Municipal Health Bureau. \\nCity Health Bureau family homes in Baihua Village, facing the street, is a courtyard. Four rows of houses in the courtyard, six in each row. There is a door to the street of Baihua Village. From that door to the right hand row of houses, the first family lives a Beijing woman, the second is Qi ming's sister Qi Xiuwen family, the third is Qi Ming's parents live, the fourth home is Qi Xin, the fifth house is Zhang Xijing, and the last family is also a woman. The corner of this row of houses and separate houses is a public toilet. The first home to the left of the hospital door is the head of the three promotion Guo Jinzhu. Qi Ming's brother-in-law is 38 style old cadres, director of health bureau. \\nQi Xin's lover Golden Ling is a big family grew up lady, looks very beautiful, talking more talking. Her uncle was nurtured by his father and was the director of a chemical plant in Liudao Bay after graduating from college. He married a Russian and later divorced. After the divorce did not marry again, he followed the Golden Tomb life. His salary is high and helps Golden Tomb. Chisin dinner with his parents, pay to help parents. \\nThe area of the house is not large, inside and out of two rooms. The interior is slightly larger in the bedroom and the outside is the kitchen. The family took a shed at the doorstep, boiled water inside to cook and free up the outside dining room. After Yego came with the army, Grandma and Grandma and Manman lived between them, and Yego and the army slept in the marching bed outside. \\nA family of three generations of five people crowded in this house of thirty squares. Yego writes materials at night, with children during the day, sweaters, pick water, cook. In the afternoon, go to places such as the Public Security Council, the Revolutionary Commission and other places to ask about Qi ming's news, and to Her style is not good, tired holding the child sitting on the roadside, can doze. \\nPreviously, Ziming's salary and drafts were given to the mother. The mother also took care of the family. Qi ming now has no wages, no food, and Yego does not have wages. A family of seven people, and every month depends on the wages of one person per month. Chissin paid more than 70 yuan a month, and paid the full amount of money to his mother. In addition to giving grandpa a few bucks, the rest of the money she holds. Buying food is a bunch of dishes sold on the side of the street, a pile of "

The money is back when it runs out. \\nQiqiu lives in Jianguo Road. \\nGrandma is not good for a few children either. Little man lack of nutrition chicken breast, soldiers pulled belly did not in time see as an anal. Feed an egg under a chicken, grandma concealed to her daughter's house next door. Ziming's special offer, grandma holding, Yego has never used it. Then the soap and soap were quantitative, after the grandmother was locked in the drawer, only on the outside of the ignition alkali. Yego is a southerner, pay attention to health like clean. Wash clothes, hand wash without soap, soap, use fire alkali. Originally Yego is delicate white skin, a pair of hands is also greasy, but the long-term stimulation of fire alkali makes hands cracked, cracked a blood mouth, washing hands, washing clothes, a wet, cracked blood tract of heart pain. Yego doesn't even have the money to buy toilet paper. The holiday came, take a little broken cloth pad; wash hands without soap before cooking, she said to the child, 'Go, you go to the next aunt to have a little soap!' After the child went, he got back a small piece of soap in the size of the copper money, got the hands can not be pinched, yet wash it slip off. \\nOne day, the army clapped to run back happily from the outside and shouted: 'Mama, Mama, I tell you a good thing!' Yego busy asked: 'What good thing?' 'My brother's peering is cattle!' The cow he said, is milk. Yego went to see, his son's urine was the same as one beach milk. Ye Ge frightened his face, his heart 'fluttered' and jumped. After the test, it was said to eat too much potatoes, it was starch urine. \\nManman and soldiers, long as a child are very beautiful, fat big eyes on the face, people love. A yard inside man, nothing does not hold him. Xiuwen's daughter also especially loves to amuse him to play. This is the face of yellow muscle thin, far less than flattering before. \\nA yard lived, sometimes gave an old clothes or something, and the two aunts did not buy a pair of socks, a line for the child. \\nGrandma sometimes said to Yegora quack: 'A sheep, a grass, one person a food, why do you rely on me every day, a buns a few people eat?' Yego listened to this saying very sad, just lay down into the nest 'whining' and crying: 'I can go to Kunming brother, but I distressed these three children ah...'\\nQi Bin, because his brother did not do his things, he was aligning his heart with resentment. He often went to the home of the big sister Qiqiu. Zhang Bing, the big brother-in-law, is a famous Chinese medicine practitioner in the military region. As soon as Chisin paid his mother, she went to her daughter. Qi Bin met, and asked: 'How about your brother?' And she said, Chissin directed to your sister-in-law, and the rice she brought to him a day was oil. Your sister-in-law confused his mouth with oil!' \\nIn fact, Qi Xin and everyone eat the same, bag the valley pancakes, wipe the pot with oil, not easy to dip the pot. Big sister Qi Jiqiu and two sister-in-law Golden Ling family life is better, poor life is Qi Xin, Ye Ge, grandfather and children. The old little six or seven, life is arranged by grandma. \\nQi ming suffered, pulling a few children to live by people, eating poor, Yego is not counting. But what she did not think of was the nonsense of her mother-in-law and a letter from Qi Bin to Chisin. \\nQi Bin wrote a letter to Qi Xin. After looking at the golden tomb, Yego saw, the letter said Chisin: Yego gave you the oily bread that Yego gave you a day, put your mouth in oil, and you were bought by the landlord's mother-in-law. She mistreated my mom, you ignore it, ask her dog landlord to get out! \\nAfter Yego looked, cried for a long time: 'Your brother brought you out of the countryside, you came out of one, your brother met something, you were not united in the distress, you said? You helped me, you said you could, you didn't help me, and insulted me with words like this...'\\nAfter reading the letter, Yego said: 'Jinling, you give this letter to your second brother-in-law to see. If he doesn't want to see, you read him, let him hear it!' After reading, the two brother-in-law said, how can it be so nonsense? I stayed at this door, I saw it. I gave her a bowl of rice, and she took it back for the children. How can Qi Bin say that? \\nGrandpa is an old man who leaves fall off fear of breaking his head, less words. And he saw Yegor with three grandchildren, and was busy, that he would take care of the grandchildren, and to run together. He does not say in his mouth, the same as in the heart of the When Grandma was not home, Grandpa was there like self-speaking and facing Yego, saying, 'These children are not like words, they all say you are bad, I see you better than all of them! These brothers and sisters, his brother, something happened. Which one went to his brother? His brother brought them all out, and none of them had a little conscience! Yego writes materials at night, go out and run during the day, the eyes are crying red, who cares about them? \\nGrandpa said the fair words, the wound that Yego was sprinkled with salt was like a little cool dew. \\nYe Ge and Xiuwen met Huang Ming at his big sister Jiqiu's family. Jiqiu and Huang Ming are children's family. Xiuwen said to Huang Ming: 'This is my big sister Ye Ge!' Huang Ming is as familiar as he did not hear, and there was no reaction on the face. \\nHuang Ming is an intellectual under Zhang Zhonghan of the 359 Brigade. At that time, intellectuals were actually a junior high school student or high school student. Although he was of the Second Army, Wang Enmao did not like him. He is open and his mind is more open. He has opinions about the removal of Wang Zhen, especially with the Sinlan Pavilion. He was a head of the Planning Commission of the Autonomous Region. When he held the Eighth Congress, his organizers wrote a letter to respond to the Xinjiang issue to the Eighth Congress. As a result, the right was beaten to the right. He and Qi ming should be pity and pity, but I don't know why so? \\nYege and Golden Ling two sipers in the stove side opposite to the pot pulled pieces of noodles. Nephew (son of the autumn), came, stood aside and said to the two aunt: 'My sister is married tomorrow, my mother asks you to go!' Yego was her uncle, and she neither said a word nor looked at her. \\nYego knows that his own man went wrong, did not pay for money, and did not wear good clothes, go will give them disgraceful...\\nYege can't think about it. It is a mother, how is the heart of Qi Ming so kind, ordinary, upright, a ragged man's meal, can move a stool to make a meal, and a sister is so low about a victim's sister-in-law? \\nAfter knowing Qi ming, Chen Ruizhang found Qi home and asked Qi ming's mother: 'He participated in the revolution since childhood, how has he become a counter-revolution?' \\nAlthough Chen Ruizhang and Qi ming did not live together for a few days, he also remembered old feelings. \\nYego and mother-in-law are sometimes also harmonious. When harmonious, the two people also said about the old things of the past. \\nOn September 5, 1968, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee was established. Not many days later, Yego went to ask again, said Qi ming had been sent back to Kashgar. \\nYego also returned to Kashgar with the boss Qi Jun and the old two Qi Tao. \\nWhen Chisin sent three of Yego's mother and son to the car, Chisin pulled Yego's hand and said, 'Sister sister-in-law, I'm sorry for you, I didn't take I also do not have any greater capacity...'\\n14\\nQi ming raised the biscuits disregarding the son army and manman who wanted to eat a cookie, disregarding the mother's dissuasion out of the door, went to Nanchang Road to hear the treble horn 'rush, hurry, hundreds of thousands of emergency, hundred thousand emergency, eight nong red flag headquarters is surrounded, in danger!' The shouting, stride towards there. He is like a moth to the light of his heart, and desperately flies towards the light of truth that he believes! \\nShortly after entering the Badong Red Flag resident animal husbandry building, the animal husbandry building was first attacked by the Crown's 'three hurts', and was caught. \\nSiming was handcuffed and blindfolded to a black house. When photographing him, the light is too strong, eyes and blindfolded again, a strong photographic light shines him without opening his eyes. After the photo and closed in a guarded workshop on all sides, I do not know when it was brought into the black lacquered big iron door, high wall grid, around the watchtower. He was put into the trumpet. \\nAfter calming down in the trumpet, he remembered the two sons who left Kashgar after one another were sick, Yego dizzy vomiting, his forehead coin size a piece of red and purple. This is a precursor to his own prison? \\n... after thinking, he still did not believe that it was a spiritual revelation. He is a materialist. What he believes is the truth. What he believes in is the Party, Chairman Mao, and what he believes is Chairman Mao's revolutionary route. \\nQi ming is an important figure, locked in a single one. \\nAfter Qi Ming was locked up, there are still leaflets on the outside 'Qi Ming, Wang Enmao Qi Ming Erjie Wang Enmao, Qi ming Three Ji Wang Enmao'. The police in the detention centre are also divided into two factions. I do not know which faction of the police, opened the small window, looked at Ziming, asked:\\n'Qi Ming, have you delivered the material to the outside?' \\nQi Ming shocked and said, 'No wow!' \\n'How is there a revelation of Wang Enmao outside, two Wang Enmao?' \\n'Who of you sent me out?' \\nAsker muted. \\nOnce on the toilet, Qi Ming squat in the toilet for a longer time, came out and was cursed by the guards: 'How do you stay for so long?' \\nQi ming said: 'This is the toilet, not a garden. What do I have to do in it for so long?' The guard took the butt to beat him, kicked his lower body, hurted 'Ouch' a scream, crouched over the crotch, and the sweat beads on the head went outward! \\nQi ming said to the people of the army control of the detention center, 'You also beat people!' The people of the ARC said, 'No!' \\nQi ming, who was held in solitary confinement, did not know the situation of Yego and the children. He did not know how much suffering Yego took the army to Beijing to appeal. He did not know how much tears Yego had flowed; nor did he know Chen Qiang in order for him to find Wei Gangyan and Ding Dong and others in Xi'an, Beijing; he also did not know Chen Rui, who had worked with him. Zhang and Zhang Wei have also asked him, run for him to embrace uneven...\\nSeptember 18, 1967, that day was the Mid-Autumn Festival. In the evening, Qi ming wants to see the moon, but four walls are strict, only a peep window. He looked out through a small window on his side, imagining the midheaven's round of the moon. Long long, complex and sit down, all the way:\\nLook through the iron window of autumn moon, wraps into waves. \\nThoughts spread wings flying outside, cage collapse moving song. \\nDarkness will shine, blood teardrops clotted flowers. \\nLiver brilliant, dare to call the kingdom of the Hui! \\nQi ming is caught in a high wall, look does not complain. None of the children in the poems are long in love, nor do they recall the lives of their wives and children, even less aware that Yego is tormenting on his return to the appeal. He is still the brave spirit of war years. In October, he according to the 'wave of Taosha' card, filled the first 'extinguishing Tinder', 'Message Red II Division':\\nRevolution Tinder Red, laughing black wind. \\nBlowing the flags more virulent. \\nWaving the stick against evil eagles,\\nboldly and loyal. \\nHeart to Mao Zedong, heal more brave \\nRumors are difficult to forge. \\nThreat profit can not scare,\\nFrontier Mountain Eagle. \\nThe word overflowed with a strong belief in the cupola pride, and there is no remorse for the lash of old and conservative forces. There are 'people in and out of the door locked, open for dogs to climb out of the hole' and 'prefer to sit firmly on.' \\nNovember 1967, the day, the world was snowy, he looked at the flying snow, according to the 'partridge day' card, filled a 'look at snow':\\nThe winds dance snow ring iron window, calling me to sing loudly in the wind. \\nA song wing plum moving square, blossoming plum happy room. \\nListen to my song, listen to me sing, unique arrogant cream. \\nLet its trample let its humiliation, snow Mei zheng Yan spring put. \\nIn December 1967, Qi ming twice received a note from his brother Qi Xin, and the attached note mentioned that Beijing Ding Dong had greetings to him. \\nQi Ming and Ding Dong were known during Yan'an. Ding Dong formerly known as Ding Jiansheng, born in 1917, is born in Feng County, Jiangsu. Youth was influenced by progressive ideas, went to Yan'an in January 1938 to participate in the revolution and joined the Communist Party of China in September. He was seven months earlier than Ziming to Yan'an. Ding Dong wrote a report in Yan'an's Liberation Daily, Qi Ming wrote poems and communications, and two people like-minded, correlated. Ding Dong loves to drink two drinks. In the hospital pharmacy, Qi ming gave him the fear of drinking alcohol from potassium permanganate. At that time, a young, a child, thought that alcohol was a high level of wine. Ding Dong served as editor of Harbin Beiguang Daily, the first editor of the Northeast Daily, deputy editor, president, vice-editor of Changchun Daily, vice-president, vice-president and secretary-general of Changchun Municipal Committee. June 1956, China Academy of Sciences, Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences, founded 'Philosophy Research' and 'Philosophy Translation Series'. Since the launch of Philosophy Research, he has been Deputy Director of the Editorial Department of Philosophy Research. He has participated in the editor-in-chief of the ancient Chinese philosopher's biography. No matter which newspaper or location Ding Dong is in contact with Qi ming. \\nDing Dong heard that Qi ming was arrested and his whereabouts were unknown, and then heard that he was behind bars, greeting the letters. \\nQi ming learned that Ding Dong is also concerned about himself, floating around. On December 24, he filled in a word 'butterflies flower · dingdong':\\nYanan Ding East greetings frequently, dead house new tianyang spring melting ice heart. \\nNo wonder drinking Yanhe water, affliction deeper. \\nFire in the sense of real gold, resist tyrant even throw his head. \\nHead broken blood to see, rehearse a picture of nine xiao. \\nOn the night of four days, Qi ming dreamed of the great leader Chairman Mao's visit to Xinjiang. Qi ming met the chairman while watching the big print. The two sat down, and the Chairman listened patiently to his control. Qi ming outraged, tears, said sad, turned to the Chairman's arms, howling crying...\\nSiming's cry awakened himself, it was a dream. Sui fill the word 'qinyuan spring dream':\\nNo child living alone, miss the pina, meet in dreams. \\nSee the square sea, day and night surge;\\nBefore the big print, people are piled. \\nCrazy, wave split valley...\\nFather-like care, ask for a short word;\\nPour with a hearty, flying rain tears. \\nGiant palm caress, named Hong Zhen-nian \\nYesterday created knot flowers. \\nCaesarelung, loyal, nining for the jade! \\nThese verses of self-heart, poetry, conveys a true heart of his heart. Zheng Zheng iron bone, ning for jade crushed. \\nThe eight ancient poems of Qi ming in the Iron Window were recorded in his 'Road Song' with the title 'Untenable Song'. Inside the high wall, Qi ming comfortably can read the newspaper, he can read from the newspapers across continents, and the world's eyes. \\nOn April 2, 1968: A Taiwanese seafarer wrote a letter full of deep feelings to Chairman Mao, which reads: Chairman Mao is eager to liberate Taiwan at an early date and save the suffering of the vast majority of people. This letter is packed in a sealed canned box. Cross the ocean of waves and drift to the beaches of the motherland. On the same day, the newspaper also published a conscious seafarer Jiang Jun, who took a hard time to transfer a letter to the mainland of the motherland. It drew a five-star flag on the letter and wrote: 'Giving to our compatriots on the mainland, there is talk, long live the People's Republic of China.' Qi Ming wrote a poem 'A small canned box singing on the vast sea' and 'Seamen Jiang Jun to paint the flag'; on a photo of 'The Brave Blacks Destroy Chicago Shop,' he wrote a 'Song of the Black Sniper,' and he saw an April 28 newspaper 'Black America's struggle against a violent struggle against a black man.' Wind and rain, American imperialist lair Washington flames, smoke rolling. After the message, wrote 'The flame is not extinguished'. \\nQi ming is convinced that the paper in the paper printed out of black and white words, the passion is full of acura. \\nCrazy years are surrounded by simplicity, childish, fool the hearts of the people. \\nThe Kashgar Revolutionary Council was established, and Qi Ming wrote a long poem 'The Red Regency of Kashgar', entitled 'To the Heroic Descendants of the Commune of Paris'. Poems last fifty verses, two sentences, a total of 100 sentences. \\nOn September 5, 1968, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee was established. Shortly after its establishment, in the iron window closed for 16 months Qi ming, was sent to Urumqi, sent back to Kashgar...\\n15\\nQi ming returned to Kashgar in November 1968, more than 20 months after leaving in March and April 1967. For 20 months, Kashgar was surrounded by bloody rain and wind. \\nIn February 1967, the Southern Xinjiang Military Region sent more than 1,000 cadres and soldiers to participate in the 'three and two armies' (left, branch workers, farmers, military control, military training). In March, the Southern Military Region imposed military control over the Public Security Department of the Kashgar Commissioner's Office, the Post and Telecommunications Bureau of the Kashgar District, the Kashgar Daily, the Transport Department, the Transport Department, the Cable Broadcasting Station in Kashgar City and the Grain Bureau of Kashgar District. \\nOn August 14, the Kashgar 'federation' and 'FHKI' instigated a part of the unknown masses, attacking another faction living in the buildings of the Kashgar municipal committee and municipal government, and set fire to the buildings of the Kashi Municipal Committee and Municipal Government. On the 16th, some people in Kashgar 'Sanfu' and Shule County 'Joint Committee' organized a peasant attack on the Qili Bridge, killing two people and injuring more than 40 others. Afterwards, Kashgar 'Sanxin' clogged the seven mile bridge with a cotton bag, interrupting the traffic between North and South Kashgar. \\nThe interruption of the main traffic roads between the north and south is a matter of domestic and international concern, alarmed the central \\nOn October 9, State Council Premier Zhou Enlai appointed representatives of the Xinjiang Military Region 7335 troops and the Xinjiang Red Second Division Corps to Kashgar, with mass organizations of the Southern Military Region and Kashgar factions, to negotiate the opening of Kashgar Qili Bridge traffic. On the 13th, Zhou Enlai personally called Kashgar, asking 'to stop the fighting, open traffic, and the organizations themselves 'fight, approve, change', dissolve the command, join together'. On the 15th, representatives of the Southern Xinjiang Military Region, Kashgar Wuwei Command, 'Sanxiu' and 'Joint Committee' in Shulle County reached an agreement to open traffic between North and South Kashgar, and dismantled the Qili Bridge roadblock in the city of Kashgar on the evening. \\nSince then, in the period of more than a year by the end of September 68, there were five armed fighting incidents, killing 55 people, injuring 66 people, beating 172 people and maiming 8. In addition, between July and September 1968, individual leaders of Bachu County engaged in 'forcing, confessions and letters' in Xelipua, creating a fake case called 'treason to the Soviet group'. More than 500 cadres and the masses of the company were rounded up. The vast majority of the people were bundled, six people were killed and seven disabled. \\nWhen Saming was sent back to Kashgar, it was all dusty. \\nQi ming was sent directly to Shule County, handed over to the mass organizations of the Yangtman commune. The mass organization's team has long been waiting there to hang a big sign to the neck of Qi ming, which says 'Down the reactionary academic authority and the current counter-revolutionary Ziming'. The sign hung on the neck is not with a wire rope, but with fine wire. Shule County to the sheep big man 16 km, Qi Ming's neck hanging big sign in front, followed by a team of dozens of people in the mass organization, holding a small red flag, waving fist, shouting slogans: 'Down the reactionary academic authority!' 'Down the current counter-revolutionaries!'. Pedestrians or villagers who smelled, went to the roadside and stayed to see. \\n16 kilometers of road, step by step from the bottom of the foot, every step, the big brand embellished with fine wire will grind on the skin of the neck, each one will stimulate the skin painful sensation. He bitten his teeth and endured severe pain. When went to Sheep Daman commune, the fellow people were on the roadside watching, Klimu township rushed past, with the leader of the team did not know a few words, went up to the brand on the neck of Ziming took away. \\nThe red imprint on the neck of Qi ming almost seeded blood. He was relieved. \\nHe returned home, home a wolf, rotten glass, broken glass on the ground, the shelves moved away, books were stacked on the ground, some good books were stolen from the window. When it became a wind, a lot of Kashgar cadres came here to take refuge, Qi ming's home became a refuge. A cadre of the Kashgar Land Committee surnamed Bai lived here for many days. \\nAlthough Qi ming was robbed several times in his life, but did not cry several times. Go home, face scattered and untraceable books, sweeping distressed, tears, even sipping, howling! \\nThe book is his life...\\nThe mass organization of Sheep Daman also organized a campaign. The fight was prepared for several years. Qi ming was caught in Urumqi. Some people of the Sheep Daman commune wanted to open his critics, but unfortunately at that time he was in Urumqi, the whip of the mass organization was out of reach. Qi Ming is not, just fight Yego! Preparing to criticize Yego, the food that will be eaten is ready, some people mouths more words, causing the fish into the net to be freed again. This gas has been fermented in some people's chest. Then Qi ming came back, but they had to vent it well. \\nQi ming in the eyes of Uyghur fellow people, was a very kind, very honest, very prestigious person, but some people secretly incite and provoke. Said Qi ming commanded military fighting in Kashgar, said Yego still commanded there with a doll, said on August 16, 1967, Kashgar 'three hurts' and Shule County 'joint committee' attacked the Qili Bridge, and the three new defense battle is Qi ming command. This sparked the outrage of people who had participated in combat and had casualties. They rushed on the stage, punched and kicked, and some dragged his hair. Ziming was a plate, and could not hold the hair, and they pulled his eyebrows. Qi ming long two longevity eyebrows, than hair is easier to grab. And they pulled his eyebrows. A punch, full face is blood, teeth knocked off several...\\nZiming has many truths and many words to say to them, but they do not give him time nor allow him to say. He said they didn't understand either. \\nAfter the fight, Qi ming was put into the cattle shed, along with Simweiwen, Wang Weihan and other working together. \\nLabor came back, Qi ming still wanted to eat, I don't know who put Naan, or buns on the window sill. Sometimes the windowsill still crimped a small note, saying, 'A few points you go to a certain piece of bag, I send you dumplings to eat'. Every time these naan or dumplings are eaten, Qi ming's heart will rush through a warm stream. He knows these are Yang Liping, Nie Dingbo, Youxiang Xiu and other people who have worked in a piece of work and those good Uyghur hometown care for him. \\nYang Liping also gave him the laundry quilt. \\nSiming laundry no detergent, no money to buy washing powder, want to Simvion to a little. Simvion did not give. He thought, 'This snob eye! How many times did you eat at my house when you were single in the commune? What a white eye wolf!' \\nThe Commune Reform Committee also allowed Qi ming to the very remote top ten teams to raise pigs. The house where he lived had no doors, mosquitoes were a lot. He remembered Zhou Bowen, who had filmed his breasts to his name 'Big Brother' and would make curtains. Qi ming let the webmaster of the forest management station Qin Deming bring him a letter, let him compile a door curtain. Later Qin Deming said to Qi ming: 'Don't you let Zhou Bowen give you a curtain, he doesn't just make up your bad words.' \\nDuring the work of the top ten teams, Ziming and a Uighur doctor in the commune lived together. A do not grow up very handsome, but also very young. Siming feeds the pigs, he works underground. At that time, all those who eat food were going to work. One day, he asked Qi Ming and said, 'Governor Qi, can you go? I'm going to go. My mom and dad are in Kashgar. I ran to Kashgar and they couldn't find it!' ...\\n16\\nQi ming listened to people saying that Yego was ready to return to Kashgar, and bought pig feed to Kashgar to inquire about Yego's news. \\nQi ming to Kashgar first find Xu Tan. Xu Tan's wife, Maqin, pushed him out at first sight. Qi ming said you don't push, I have money here, I can stay in a hotel, not here. Said he pat the pocket of the drums. Then he said that I was mainly asking if there was any situation with Yego...\\nYego took the two children out of the car and walked to the post and telecommunications office. To the post and telecommunications office, she's going to call Siming. \\nQi ming didn't hear anything from Xu Tan, he went to the Post and Telecommunications Office to call Urumqi to see if Yego moved? When do you move? Yego in the middle of the business room, ziming in the outside. As Yego picked up the microphone was about to call, she heard the voice of the outsiders. She put down the microphone and come out for a look, exactly the same. \\nNeither of them thought that a family reunion was such a coincidence. \\nQi ming said, don't be afraid now, we can stay at the guest house at night, I have money here. Said he pat his drumball pocket again. Yego said, Where is the money you have not reinstated, and there is no repayment of wages? He said that I came to Kashgar to pick you up. 'They' knew I had no money on my body, just three yuan, that five yuan stuffed on me. The money for this top is 'they' give. Speaking, Qi ming also said 'they' are also very poor, neither easy. The name of 'them' and the amount of money I remember on a piece of paper, and then we pay back them again. \\nYego told Qi ming about her petition and said that the reception station of the Central Cultural Revolution Group had written a note for her. The two are ready not to return to the commune, live in Kashgar run against the matter. \\nSouthern Xinjiang construction company had a person who met with Qi ming, found a house for Qi ming, a family of 4 first settled there. \\nThe Southern Construction Division has a staff cafeteria, where it is eaten every day. At that time, shortly after the establishment of the Revolutionary Commission, the entire administration was in a state of paralysis, and the defeated capitalists were still on the sidelines. Meng Shulin, secretary of the Kashgar Land Committee, has not yet been 'liberated', and also During a meal in the cafeteria, Qi ming saw Meng Shulin. One is those who have lost outside power, the one is a fundraiser who has stepped down; those who lost outside power hold a villain view, and the capitalists who step down hold the view of the crown. The two people looked at each other and neither spoke. Yego also said, Why didn't you talk to him? \\nThe leaflets caught by Qi ming were also transported to Nanjing, and pictures of Qi ming were captured on the walls of Nanjing Street. Yego's brother Ye Shusen worked at the Nanjing Automobile Factory, and was also the head of a certain faction in the Cultural Revolution. When he saw his brother-in-law drowling his head, closed eyes, eloquent beating the same photos, a thriller in his heart. Back home cry a game. He bought 30 pounds of rice, bought two cigarettes, bought a salt duck and a couple of small socks, and arrived in Xinjiang. In winter, Urumqi is cold and cold. He did not know how cold Xinjiang could be, and he was on the road with only a thin little padded jacket. Sit a few days by train to Urumqi and got off the car, he ran to the district party committee. They told him that Ziming was in Kashgar. He took a few days to Kashgar and said he lived in Sheep Daman commune in Shule County. He then walked 20 kilometers of road with 30 pounds of rice, two cigarettes, a salt duck and a couple of small socks, and his feet were grind out of bubbles before he went to Sheep Daman commune. When asked to Sheep Daman commune, he fluttered another empty: they did not know where is Ziming now? \\nYe Shusen's mind a lost...\\nWang Weihan, deputy secretary of the commune, saw him all the way from Nanjing to Goat Daman, and called him to his house to eat a meal, and sent him to Kashgar with a carriage. In Kashgar, no one knew where Qi ming lived, he stayed down at the People's Hotel. One day, he talked to people about Siming and his sister Yego, a business bureau man who heard him and came to tell him I knew, I knew where they lived. \\nAt that time, Ye Shusen found the South Construction Division with those brought from Nanjing. \\nMy brother met, Yego was surprised and surprised, and the two brothers were a tear rain again. Two people have an unfinished topic, Ye Shusen also said: 'Did you save me once?' 'Yes, that's what happened on the boat when my mother sent me back to the orphanage,' Yego said. 'I still have the impression that you pulled my legs before my mother pulled me up from the water...'\\nQi ming lived in the Southern Construction Division while looking for the leadership of the Executive Department to solve food, wages and work issues. \\nQi ming asked the director of the regional reform committee to reflect his situation. \\nQi Ming does no"

Qi Ming said: 'No!' The guard said, 'Then wait a while first!' After a while, Li Shuangsheng did not meet him either. The guards sent Ziming back. The guards went in and said to Li Shuangsheng: 'Just came to someone looking for you.' Li asked, 'What is the name of that person?' 'The man named Ziming.' As soon as Li Shuangsheng heard of Qi Ming, he immediately thought of the writer Qi ming, who was once in the army. Qi ming's big name he has heard, also seen, just not much talk. He immediately asked the people in the office of the Land Committee whether he was the former writer Qi Ming, where he lived. He immediately sent a person to the South Construction Division to find Qi ming. After taking him up, he said, 'Oops, Qi Ming, I'm really sorry! I didn't ask.' So he asked Qi ming to clear the original commission of the matter, and he first solved the issue of wages and food. Yego did not have an account book, he asked the commissioner of the commune to write one. \\nWhen Qi Ming was in the army, Li Shuangsheng was a head of the army, left of the Cultural Revolution, and was the director of the Regional Reform Commission. \\nQi ming also gave the opinions written by the Central Cultural Revolution to the Regional Reform Commission. The Regional Reform Commission looked after giving it to Shule County Armed Forces Department. \\nQi ming and Yego do not want to go to sheep big man again, and we do not make mistakes, what is it to stay until the sheep big man? So Qi ming went to the Kashgar Land Commission. \\nThe Board gave him a large office. This large office is both Ziming's study and the bedroom of the Ziming family. \\nAksu Meteorological Station gave Yegopin, admitting that her working hours began in 1956. She was placed in the Finance Office of Kashgar Guardian School. \\nMeng Shulin 'liberated' and returned to the Land Committee. He wrote a letter of introduction to Qi Ming, asking him to go to Markit Southern Corps Command. Yego was reluctant to come to the Corps. She knew that the conditions in all aspects of the regiment were much worse than local. Qi ming did not listen to Yego's advice, and the tears of Yego came down, and the two sons looked at their mother cried, and they cried. \\nQi ming took a letter of introduction to Markit. After looking at the introduction letter, asked: 'Did you make a mistake?' Qi ming said: 'I did not make any mistakes!' Chaine Yuan said: 'No mistakes are made, just so you do not understand to go to the field work? How would this be okay? Meng Shulin is only the honorary corps cadre. He does not have the power to mobilize you! The authority to appoint and dismiss cadres of Corps is at Corps Command. He arranges that we can't accept it!' \\nChai Yuan for Qi ming blocked a bit. \\nFinally, Qi ming hung in the Kashwun Union, let him name the honorary vice chairman of the Kashi Wen Union. \\nAfter Yego restarted his work at the Guardian School, he was enthusiastic. He had not slept before 2 o'clock every night. Work must be advanced, to actively create conditions for joining the party, but also to give a copy of the manuscript, sometimes even to 455 o'clock. Qi ming's 'Road Song' was printed at that moment. \\nDuring school check-up, the chest has a lot of calcification points in the lungs of Yego. \\n'Have you ever had tuberculosis?' \\n'I don't know wow!' \\nAt this time, Ye Ge wanted to come as a child in the foster mother's family, brother Shi Xinghua had tuberculosis, he was infected and natural calcification did not know...\\n17\\nAt the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Chen Qiang gave himself a nickname 'Little Brownkey.' \\nBlanci's full name is Louis Augustus Blanci, born in 1805 and died in 1881. is a modern French proletarian political activist. He joined the coal-burning party of the secret revolutionary group as early as he went to high school, opposing the restoration of Wang's government. He participated in the French Revolution of July 1530, the 1545 Revolution, the 31 October 1570 uprising and the 22 January 1571 uprising. Active participation in and organization of the famous secret revolutionary organization of the 1930s and 1940s. One of his famously sayings is: 'It is the vocation of a revolutionist to fight constantly, to fight against everything, to the end of the death.' \\nChen Qiangxian is to learn Gorky, left uncle wandering alone, taste the underlying suffering, such as hungry and thirsty reading. Read and read, and favored the Brownkey. \\nAfter the Cultural Revolution, he became a small leader in the rebel group in Kashgar. Qi ming was arrested in 1967 '6.24\\. He received some Qi ming friends contact address from Qi Xin, and went to Xi'an, Beijing and other places, and appealed to him. He intentionally sought out those friends of Qi ming, first was to see what attitude of those friends aligned in the Cultural Revolution. He found some old friends such as Wei Gangyan and Du Pengcheng, and none of them said Qi ming a 'no' word. In Weinan, he participated in the activities of the villain and wrote a Diary of Blood. In Beijing, he found Ding Dong, Editorial Department of Philosophy Research, Academy of Social Sciences. \\nChen Qiang and Ding Dong talked about speculation. Ding Dong said that when I was 'liberated', I would like to give you a book and turn this Diary of Blood into a book. I want to let everyone know how a little Balangzi learns Marxism on the Gobi beach in Xinjiang! \\nLittle Barang, is the meaning of the Uighur children. \\nChen Qiang is talented, knowledgeable and thoughtful, but is still a wanderer without a work unit. He found Wu Julun of the Autonomous Regional Reform Commission 'Three New' organization and wrote a letter to the Kashgar Regional Reform Commission on behalf of the Autonomous Regional Reform Commission, giving him a job. The Kashgar Regional Reform Commission placed him at a local production station of the local company. After two months of work, he was not paid a salary, saying there was no salary introduction letter. At that time, Air Force 7335 troops were left in Kashgar. One day, Chen Qiang told Yego, 'Aunt, the committee wants to talk to you once.' Ye said, 'What do you want to talk to me?' Chen said, 'I don't know very well!' \\nThe Commissar asked Yego to talk to her, and after East Lasi testakingly asked her:\\n'How about Chen Qiang, this guy?' \\nYego said, 'Of course, good, love to read, and can suffer.' \\n'Yeah, Chen Qiang is a good guy!' \\n'It's a pity that a young man is not working yet?' \\n'The work has been arranged!' \\n... around and around, the political committee wanted Yego to write him a salary introduction letter. \\nYego was very credible in the Sheep Daman commune. He wrote a salary introduction letter of level 25, so that the instruments of the Sheep Damman commune bought a chapter to buy Matiimin. \\nIn this way, Chen Qiangcai has a rice bowl of 25 yuan a month at the local production station. \\nOn September 13, 1971, Lin Biao incident occurred. Lin Biao, Ye Qun, Lin Liguo and others fell dead in Wendur Khan, Mongolia. \\nChen Qiang, wearing an army coat and carrying a manuscript of the Diary of Blood, looks for the most talented people in Xinjiang University like a revolving soldier. \\nHe found Zhou Tao. \\nZhou Tao saw a few photos of Chen Qiang on the top of the diary, all of which had the strength of British force, a crossbody armed belt, a handgun on his back, and the image of a field commander during the liberation war period. Chen Qiang said that this diary is a record and experience of his personal participation in command of the armed fighting, which is a fusion of the ideas of Mao Zedong guerrilla war. \\nChen Qiang met Zhou Tao, showing a lot of enthusiasm and humility. But Zhou Tao is very arrogant and seems insolent. \\nZhou Tao also wondered why he would be so rejected. \\nShortly after the two people, Zhou Tao also arrived in Kashgar. \\nZhou Tao arrived in the ancient city of Kashgar with the idea of being a poet on a five-day long distance bus. In the college yard, he traveled with an extraordinary man. Shortly afterwards, he heard that the man was not a commissioner, but a poet who had made mistakes and was destitute. People said that he would not make mistakes, it would be bigger than the commissioner. That was a figure. Zhou Tao was delighted by the poet, as excited as a Tiger found in the dog group, and felt the light scattered out in the dim and boring environment around it. \\nThe person that Zhou Tao is excited about is Qi ming. \\nAt this time, Qi ming lived in a large office of the Commissioner, very close to Zhou Tao's office. Zhou Zuo does not move to lift his foot to the home of Qi ming. He heard Qi Ming talk about Yan'an, talk about 'small classmates' Li Ji, talk about old Du (pengcheng), he and Wei Wei, Luyuan, Du Pengcheng and a group of people bought roasted chicken, white tin bag cigarettes to see Hu Feng, talk about him and birch on the Yangtze River according to farewell...\\nZhou Tao has written a thick poem manuscript. He saw the flavor of Hu in the poetry and the kind of blood in the poetry of Hu Feng. \\n'Acacia flowers in May are good, Yan'an Qiaoergou acacia.' Two poems are printed in Zhou Tao's brain. \\nIn Kashgar, Zhou Taocai knew that Chen Qiang, a small clerk of a souvenir company, actually had great influence in a certain faction organization here. He has a role to influence the political forces in this region, far from being matched by a hair college student. Because the two people have different views, despair each other, ignore each other, and for a few years the two have no contact. \\nOnce in Qi Mingjia, Zhou Tao met Chen Qiang. Chen Qiang sat coldly on the couch and looked at Zhou Tao. One of the words in his eyes was: 'How did you also come here?' \\nThe irony means to understand, in addition to the pleasure of falling into his trap. \\nZhou Tao felt the prick in the back. Implicit felt certain superiority of Chen Qiang. Zhou Tao spoke of Chen Qiang in front of Qi Ming. Qi ming just said briefly about Chen Qiang's experience and his experience of reading books at his home and reading his books. At the end of the sentence, 'The two of you are not the same. Chen Qiang speaks of you.' \\nThe people of Kashgar said that Qi ming had two dry sons. The two dry sons were surnamed Chen, one Chen Qiang and one was Chen Hengfu. \\nChen Hengfu is a youth from Tianjin. \\nOn January 11, 1964, the Kashgar Land Committee and the special office held a party at the 'May Day' theater in Kashgar city, welcome the first batch of Tianjin to support the construction of the motherland frontier socialism to Kashgar. Among them is Chen Hengfu. \\nMost of these young people came to the frontier because of family problems or because of the fact that the college entrance examination had fallen. \\nChen Hengfu was a capitalist. He graduated from high school to Nankai University, but was not admitted because of his birth. After going to Kashgar, divide to Kashgar South elementary teaching. He is not willing to primary school teachers and loves reading. He just loved reading, only smell the fragrance of Qi ming family and often go to borrow books to read. \\nChen Heng Fu's family has a number of herringbone paintings, which were copied away at the time of the Cultural Revolution. He later returned part of the painting, and he gave his mother a list. Chen Heng Fu had a good mother. His brothers and sisters were five or six, and his mother rallied them well when they all fell 780. Constantly sent a small parcel to this daughter-in-law and sent a small item to the son. This is like a bunch of fire in the cold night, drifting in the line, giving people the warmth and thoughts of home. \\nWhen Ye Ge and Qi Ming came to Chen Hengfu's family, his loved one also came up with Wang Xizhi's word to show them. \\nChen Hengfu said his mother was great. Under such a bad condition, he pulled them all big, and they were still very successful. \\nYege remembered his mother-in-law, envy Chen Hengfu had such a great mother. \\nChen Hengfu speaks, insightful about things and speaks rich philosophical. And Chen Qiang's character is somewhat different from him, introverted, poorly spoken. But talking to Ziming, sometimes it is also ringing. \\nZhou Tao met Chen Hengfu at Qi Ming's home. Chen Hengfu refers to his mouth and cannot speak. Zhou Tao asked him what happened. Qi ming said he laughed, saying that this person likes to drink alcohol. As a result, there was a bottle containing kerosene, he did not look carefully, he picked up and poured into his mouth, resulting in a throat hurt. The throat was hurt, and Yego invited Dr. Hua from the health school to come home to see him. Diagnosis is 'inhaled pneumonia'. \\nChen Hengfu does not speak, Yu Yu is reluctant to sit there, and look arrogant. He had a kind of apathy and eloquence, like some of the big locals who had been living in a small town in that era. \\nOn August 10, 1974, Wang Zhenwen was appointed secretary of the Kashgar Land Committee. During the Autonomous Region Party Committee, Wang Zhenwen saw an article on 'Criticism of the Gotha Platform' on the Political Theory Edition of the Xinjiang Daily, signed by Chen Qiang. Wang Zhenwen was greatly surprised. \\nWang Zhenwen returned to Kashgar when he got off the plane to his office, he asked the secretary to come to the regional production station to find Chen Qiang. Once he talked to Chen Qiang, Wang Zhenwen held his hands with him four or five times, and he didn't expect Kashgar to have such a talent. \\nIn the eyes of Ho Shu-Ying, Chen Qiang is smart, steady, speaks Sven, and does not love to speak too much. \\nIn the Cultural Revolution, the border city of Kashgar, far away from Beijing, like the whole country, school closures and factory stoppages are revolutionized. He Shuying was busy in the livestock department office of the LCC when the municipal committee building was burned. Some say burning the municipal party building! He really burned for a look. He Shu-ying honest, bad things, and no matter the idle, belong to people who do not hear the window and want only to do work. The breeding sheep from Yili, who came to Beijing to pick up cows and received donkeys from Guanzhong, several working groups that are investigating the countryside have asked him to contact and receive them. They are all a major event for the people concerned and the livestock industry in the areas concerned. Which one is not going to do it properly? \\nHe met Chen Qiang when he went to 'Sanxin' to contact the car. \\nI met and had no interaction. Meet is just a nod. \\nOn the night when Chen Qiang married, a person from the Commissioner said, 'Hey, Chen Qiang married, go, let's go and play!' \\nChen Qiang's wedding was held in the auditorium of the Southern Construction Division or the food company, presided over by the head of the villains of a car team near the hotel. \\nThe wedding is a revolutionary wedding, you don't know, everyone went to see a hilarious. Good relations, send Chairman Mao's quotation, a portrait of Chairman Mao, or a washbasin cookware or something; a lively excitement, eating a sugar, eating a handful of melon seeds or a hilarious cave room is even a congratulations on a couple of new life events. \\nChen Qiang's lover called Zhuang Jing, looks very beautiful, is the old four sisters in Shufu County as a teacher in a middle school. The boss in the sister flower called Zhuang Dahua, husband Wang Xuekan. Wang Xuekan, Shandong people, is a technician in Shufu County agricultural machinery station, is also graduated from Kaifeng, and he Shuying often has contacts. He Shuying lives in the financial compound, loves to go to the park to exercise. Chen Qiang also went. The South Construction Division has a single Guilin, an architect, a Tianjin man, a good kick in football, is the head of the 'three new', graduated a year or two earlier than He Shuying. Chen Qiang loves to play with them. \\nChen Qiang is not an ordinary person. In the eyes of Zhou Tao, he is driving a boat alone in a staggering political wind; his heart is calm and determined to go alone, either sinking in the adventure, or the world will rise to the top. \\nIn the mid-1970s, Wang Hongwen, vice chairman of the CPC Central Committee, went to Kashgar, and called Chen Qiang in a short stay. Li Desheng visited Xinjiang and also received him. \\n18\\nThe Kashgar Land Committee organ should convene a critical congress. \\nThe branch of the local committee committee, the youth and the women's party held a meeting to study, and to select a spokesperson. All of the people here said that Zhou Tao is most appropriate to speak, and understand poetry. Speeches can speak of the key points. Zhou Tao is anxious, how can I go to criticize Mr. Douqi? Isn't that bereavement? Originally, Qi ming was not a person of the Land Committee, how would he prefer to criticize him in the Land Committee? Zhou Tao is striving to join the party, and it happens to meet such an unacceptable opportunity for success. \\nZhou Tao said that I am not a party member and it is not appropriate to speak. \\nEveryone said, it doesn't matter if it's not a party member. Now is creating conditions for you. \\nThe party committee secretary of the organ came up with a bunch of materials that were bound and told Zhou Tao, that you take it back to prepare for preparation. This is Qi ming's reactionary remarks. Zhou Taoyi, it is Mr. Qi's poem. Zhou Tao's head rang 'The acacia flowers in May ah, Yan'an Qiaoergou acacia' came, the verses are so bright, the expression of feelings is so real and flexible, how can I go to pretend as a ground to approve him? An old warrior who came into the revolution in 1938 is now being criticized by some vulgar officials who don't know what the revolution is, and in the name of the revolution, it is too far too much to let me be an accomplice. \\n... Zhou Tao outraged to reject it. \\nThe party committee secretary of an organ named Yang looked at Zhou Tao coldly and immediately appointed another person to speak. \\nThe criticism meeting was held in the meeting room of the local committee. \\nYang said, let Qi ming come up and meet now. \\nQi ming came up and stood in the middle of the venue on a piece of open space for him, without a word. \\nYang said, lower your head down! \\nThe wonderful head of Ziming did not hesitate to lower, and two long eyebrows covered his eyes. Qi ming has long been commonplace, routine cutscenes, no sound from beginning to end, not inferior, no expression. Wait to Yang said, you can go down, Qi Ming Aung's head twisting big stride, head is not back, such as no side. \\nThe next day, the area of the opposite of the Kashgar Daily, began to publish a full version of the article, the title is very long, sensational, as if Ziming is a leading millions of people to attack Kashgar demon...\\nQi ming was criticized in the local committee, and Qi ming's son Qi army was also bullied by his companions in the compound of the local committee. \\nSince the age of four or five, Qi Jun has seen the scene of dad and mother being criticized. It also knows to be a man with a tail, not to provoke people. Not provoking people is not equal to not mess \\nLu Zhanbin is an official of the Board of Administration and loves to despise others to elevate themselves. His son was also fierce. Once I did not know what happened, he beaten Qi army with a bruised nose. Qi Jun returned home and met with Qi Ming and said, 'Oops, you really, won't fight? What can you do? You guys don't look like me at all. When I was a child, I beat those who bullied me to kneel on the ground for forgiveness. Qi ming said like that,Heart still distressed the child,Then added a sentence：'Well, eat a lot of wisdom. A little further away from them later!' \\nQi ming saw their children were bullied by people, remembering their little son soldiers. \\nThinking of Qi Hongbing, he complained about Yego: 'Your courage is big enough? Without consulting me, I gave the child!' Yego said, Where were you at that time? Those who live without seeing people, dead will not see the dead Besides, give someone, who did I give it to? Didn't it give it to your brother?' \\nQi Ming also said, 'Our little three children, are much more beautiful, and you have given it to people selfishly. Even though it is a brother, it is different after all!' \\nQi ming is like saying himself and like reproach: 'You also grew up in the family, you don't know the taste of sending people under the fence? You also give your little son to people, how can you do such confusing things, you have not felt the suffering you suffered, you still sent the little three children...'\\nAt that time, Yego had a thousand reasons to give people, but now there was no reason to convince himself. So, often confessed to cry: 'I can't afford ah, I can not pull a hug a ah ah, the national battle became a pot of porridge, in case there is a three long and two short, you do not more complain about me...'\\nChen Qiang saw Ye Ge crying there every day and washed his face with tears, and said, 'Aunt, no, I go and hold him quietly to you, okay?' \\nChen Qiang is serious and sincere in saying this, but it can only give some comfort to the injured mind. \\nAt that time, the revolutionary coalition between the 'revillains' and 'conservatives' has been a few years ago, but two political forces, from the central to the local, have a bearing. The angle force between the two has reached the white heat, clear. \\nZhou Tao's party membership issue was put on hold for refusing to speak criticizing Qi ming. \\nHe began to be hostile to the invisible immense political shadow, initially hate Jiang Qing group, and then became suspicious and resentful towards Mao himself. So fantasy of becoming a heroic character, eliminating heresy political forces and restoring the old look. After the Qingming Festival in 1976, Beijing came the news of the Fourth Five-Year Event. Zhou Tao is in a distressed mood, indignation, hoping something bigger. He walked on the street that day and suddenly met Chen Qiang. \\nChen Qiang asked, 'What do you think about this matter?' \\nZhou Tao did not answer. \\n'I know you have a view.' He said, 'Can I exchange different views, will I still tell you?' After saying, he made his mouth toward a yard behind him, 'Would you like to sit in the cold house for a while?' Zhou Tao asked, 'Where are you living?' 'Souvenir companies,' said Chen Qiang. \\nIn Chen Qiangjia, Zhou Tao lasted for too long, and said many thrilling words, including his grievances against Mao, and his brain-filled illusions about the restoration of old order in the world. \\nChen said: 'We are two different battalions. In the future it may be you die and I live and meet you on the battlefield. You guess if I'm captive, will you kill you?' Chen Qiang saw Zhou Tao without saying, and laughed himself, and said, 'Rest assured, I will not kill you.' Its expression is as generous as Cao Mengde to Chen Lin, a book student, kill no benefit, leave it undesirable. Waving a word 'Wizards are rare', so that Jianan's seven sons were completed. \\n'But what if I get caught by you?' He asked, 'How do you treat me?' \\nZhou said: 'To avoid suffering, kill immediately.' \\nChen Qiang listened to haha laughing and said: 'You can look good at me!' \\nZhou Tao said Chen Qiang, walked on the street still thinking about this matter. There is no shortage of self-mocking smiles, lamenting that both people are not free to read ancient books poison too deep. \\nBut two people could not think of that, after Zhou Enlai's death, the 'Four Five-Year Plan' incident, the death of Zhu De, the Great Tangshan Earthquake and Mao Zedong's death occurred successively. The crushing of the 'Gang of Four' on October 6 was the beginning of the end of the two political forces, but also heralded the arrival of another bad luck. \\nOn October 18, the CPC Central Committee informed party organizations at all levels about the events of Wang Hongwen, Zhang Chunqiao, Jiang Qing and Yao Wenyuan opposition groups, and communicated to the whole party and the people across the country. \\nCrush the 'Gang of Four', great pleasure. And what suffers is the innocent soldiers who are held by political forces into political wind...\\nKashgar Guardian School gave Yego a house, and the unit leader, considering that Qi ming was a writer, gave him another house next door. After moving their home, Qi Jun and Qi Tao were taken care of by Qi Lingzhu's niece of Qi ming, and the two people embarked on the road to explore the family according to the planned itinerary route. \\nYego has not been home for more than a decade. \\nYe Ge first went to Nanjing Zhongshan Road Zhangjiayuan to visit the adoptive mother. The adoptive father has died, the adoptive mother worked in a small shoe factory in the street, and his brother Shixinghua was head of a collective factory, married, and his son was four or five years old. Ye Ge and Qi ming came to the forefoot, the people sent by the Kashgar Public Security Office followed. Brother Shi Xinghua asked Yego, 'What have you been doing outside these years?' Ye Ge was surprised: 'We didn't do anything!' 'Then they came to investigate me and asked what you guys were doing back, did you write outside? Who wrote letters to?' \\nThey thought Qi ming and Yego went to find Jiang Qing. \\nAfter visiting the adoptive mother, Yego and Qi ming went to visit their mother in Quanjiao County, Anhui. \\nThe mother and her sister were married to the children's family name in the rural area of Quanjiao County, Anhui. The sister renamed Child Jinmei, and the mother also gave birth to two sons for the children's family. The people of the village were good for her mother, believing that she was later, there was no evil and did not discriminate against her. In the three years of the Great Famine, the father hung up and two brothers starve to death. The mother's hands were coincidentally, making bran what they eat, but eventually failed to save the lives of the two sons. People in the production team all negotiated to steal food, sister child Jinmei heard from far away. When they steal food, she followed them behind. After they stole it, she also steal a little. The man died of starvation and had no coffin, he lifted it with a door plate and threw it into a large pit in the ground. The pit has thrown a lot of people, fling into the pit, the fly buzz flew up. Yego often sent money to her mother. My mother said, You don't send me money, you can write me a letter, and the village people will not underestimate me. I have a son, but I never received money from my son. \\nAfter Yego went, the mother was happy and the sister's body was not too good. The mother made a lot of dishes and killed a chicken. Mother tear off a piece of meat, clamp up. Qi ming thought it was going to eat for Yego, but she gave Yego's sister. This is not consistent with common sense. Qi ming observed little, knowing that her mother and son were indeed dependent. \\nYe Ge and Qi ming's family came back soon, Qi Jun broke out. \\nQi Jun is already a junior high school student, smart, thoughtful, performing very well in school. Both Qi ming and Yego liked him very much. He grew up in a long-term depressed environment, relatively honest, also very generous, playmates all around him. After Qi ming was criticized, the wind turned big, past playmates were alienated from him, some also shouted him 'black cub', even bully him. This breath is difficult to swallow. Once, Qi Jun took a knife waiting for them, and whoever dares to say he is a 'black cub' he will fight with. When he was going to rush over and fight, he was pulled. \\n'Those children I can't care, I only have to hold him and keep him away from this place.' \\nYego and Nanjing adoptive mother contacted, prepared his luggage, found a car along the Turpan River, and sent him to the train...\\n19\\nAfter the fall of the 'Gang of Four', the CPC Central Committee set up a task force to examine Wang, Zhang, Jiang and Yao's crimes. \\nOn December 10, the Central Committee approved one of the criminal evidence materials of Wang, Zhang, Jiang and Yao anti-party groups to the whole party; later, two and three of the evidence materials were issued successively, and a campaign to uncover, approve and investigate the 'gangs of the four' was launched up and down in the country. From November 1, 1976 to May 14, 1977, four civilian and military congresses of all ethnic groups were held in Kashgar and city, with the number of participants less than 30,000 and over 340,000 people. Great and unprecedented scale. The former 'revolutionary innocence, rebellion justified' has now become 'revolutionary guilt and injustice', obeying the response of the four 'great' Mao Zedong, and activists who followed him in the revolution became the object of censorship...\\nZhou Tao saw Chen Hengfu in the large yard of the Public Security Department. The wind smelled him as if he was arrested for 'reactionary remarks'. He carried a big iron to work. He looked at four eyes, and Chen Hengfu smiled and went to work. \\nZhou Tao and his lover Ma Wen met the Director of Public Security on the road and went back to the opposite after greeting. \\nMarvin found a little bit of an ominous head and told Zhou Tao: 'When he met the Director of Public Security greeting, he looked at your kind of vision... how do I feel wrong?' \\nZhou said: 'What's wrong, how didn't I think?' \\nMarvin said, 'I think he looks at you a bit like a prisoner's eye.' \\nSoon, Zhou Tao heard news of Chen Qiang's arrest. \\nShortly after, a friend went to Zhou Tao's home and quietly told him that he was 'being censored.' Friend is a member of the Task Force for Disclosure and Approval, and the news is absolutely reliable. But Zhou Tao does not know why it was censorship. The friend sank and sighed, 'I, but this is to give you an informative letter!' Zhou Tao nodded and said, 'Know'. 'Did you say anything in Chen Qiang's family, you think carefully, is there any vicious attack on the great leader?' After saying, he hastily spoke, repeatedly commanding caution. \\nZhou Tao is stupid. The 'evil attack' at that time could be killed, and sin could not be punished. Ma said to Zhou Tao: 'You can't admit any time to the leader. You have written a lot of poems that sing to Shaoshan and Tiananmen Square. That is evidence. Why listen to the words of a counter-revolutionary, and bite you say it?' And she asked, 'Who else was there except you and Chen Qiang?' \\n'No one else anymore, just the two of us. Do I dare to be nonsense?' \\nMa Wen said furiously, Let you say less nonsense, you do not listen, sooner or later yo"

Mahongshan served as Chief of Transport Section when entering the country, before and after that time was the Political Commissar of the Southern Xinjiang Military Region. \\nMarvin's judgment is certainly accurate. Zhou Tao became one of the three key subjects of review by the Kashgar Land Commission. Write checks every day, deal with questions, accept expose criticism. The relationship between Zhou Tao and Qi ming is also evident. 'The Bourgeois Thought of Becoming a Fame,' he cried, but one of his teeth broke, saying, 'I have unlimited loyalty to the great leader.' \\nWhat Yang Muyao, secretary of the public committee of the administrative body, opened the gap at this point. Yang said: 'He will leave him a few months without honestly giving it again.' \\nZhou Tao was rescued by his loving people, and several female compatriots desperately incited the fire and spared no effort to provide all kinds of favorable circumstantial evidence. \\nQi ming and Yego naturally ran inseparably, Qisin was also under scrutiny in Urumqi. \\nQi ming quarantine examination, someone who took a gun was there to put a post for him. \\nThey underestimate Chen Qiang. He said that the articles published by Chen Qiang and the letter to Jiang Qing were written by Qi Ming, at least they were modified by him. Everyone thinks that Chen Qiang is Qi Ming's dry son. Qi Ming is Chen Qiang's backstage and works for him. Yego says these are not true. In fact, he did not work for his family, but went to their house to read books. Qi ming and Yego also did not treat him as an outsider, just like a child whose parents are not around, and let him eat. Chen Qiang's mind is reading, it is the fragrance of Qi ming's book that brought him closer to Qi Ming. Qi ming hasn't read his articles and letters to Jiang Qing. \\nYego Jean Zitao went to see his father on Sunday and wanted to contact him. One day, Yego went back with a worker, and she asked Laoqi how was there? The man said that he had asked him to deal with questions, but he lay there and cried for sleep. \\nYege was also criticized and supervised because he opened a letter of salary introduction to Chen Qiang. \\nKashgar has 100 people. Yego's performance in the General Affairs Office is outstanding. Wyans secretary Hapizi Yimin has declared Yego as the acting head of the General Services Department, but the examination has begun. \\nThe academy criticized Yego, they asked, 'Do you know how many times Ziming married?' 'I know, but that's not his reason,' Yego said. They also advised Yego and Ziming to divorce. Yego said, 'Isn't it more than another divorce charge?' School layout batter speaking. Dr. Ying said to Yego, 'Old Ye, they let me speak, I refused. I said I don't know her and can't speak?' There were more than 30 people in the General Affairs Office. When Yego was checked, Yego said nothing, he said a sentence: 'Chen Qiang, this landlord, the baby!' This sentence may be wrong and offended some people of bad origin. On the next day, a lot of large print newspapers were posted. The big print said that Yegopejingqing had gone beyond. \\nLet Yego to chop firewood, grow vegetables. Yego was there as an accountant, and after he went, they said, 'You don't have to hack, you are there!' Yego took a book there to read the book. \\nYego dismissed her from public office because she opened a 25 salary introduction letter to Chen Qiang. I'm expelled from the public office, and still go to Yego for work. Yego wrote a letter to the Autonomous Region Implementation Policy Office. When the review and approval came to an end, the Implementation Policy Committee returned a letter to the Land Commission, saying that we were dealing with the wrong cases, and that you should not create any further cases of wrong-making. The Guardian School reinstated Yego's public office again. \\nMachinyan, the lover of the nurse chief of the hospital affiliated to the Kashgar Guardian School, was a college student and a traffic police officer, was also caught up. All caught are people of different views, are versatile people. \\nKashi also held tens of thousands of people in a fighting conference. After the congress, the Jiefang big truck pulled the battered people, everyone hung a big black sign on the neck, and the treble trumpet broadcast their crimes. Yego rides on the street, just across the street to see Chen Qiang on the car. Chen Qiang bowed his head, stealing his eyes from time to time to see if there is no acqu When he saw Yego, he slowly stood straight, and slowly bowed his head, repeatedly. Yego knew he was bowing to her in line. After that, Yego saw Chen Qiang smiled. Yego's tears were flowing down. \\nThe big truck on the street went far away. Yego realized that it was Chen Qiang in giving himself a farewell. Yego went on a bike to the Post Office that street. Chen Qiang saw Yegor again, and again bowed as before. Yego crying again on the street...\\nIn the eyes of Yego, Chen Qiang is a very decent child. Learn clever, have not attended formal school, but by reading, thinking and writing have reached a certain level. His house was the landlord, and he said that the land of the landlord came out of the teeth. He told Yego that his grandfather had a steel pot that rubbed it bright every day with donkey dung eggs. He followed his uncle, uncle is an old cadre, but in order to learn Gorky's wandering reading road, run out of his uncle's house, wandering to Xinjiang, to Kashgar...\\nChen Qiang began to confess nothing after being locked up. Naturally, 'education' is inevitable. The so-called 'education' is the use of poison in different ways, and what makes him most unbearable is the betrayal of his loved one. Then one day, he suddenly took the initiative to ask for everything to be clear. The information he gave was extremely confidential, many involving the highest level of the four-man gang, as well as a large number of elements deployed under the underground activities of the remaining parties. In particular, there was a handwritten letter from Wang Hongwen, who arranged for him to go somewhere to find someone to reorganize his power. When he fled to the three forks, he was afraid of panic, sleepless overnight, he felt that he was hard, scared. He packed that credit leather, buried under a large stone on the three forks hill, and quietly returned to Kashgar. \\nChen Qiang said he was willing to make an atonement and surrender the secret letter. \\nThe Public Security Department grew up with hope. Please refer to the superiors, bring people and Chen Qiang to drive to the three forks. Chen Qiang wearing a handcuffed, climbed the mountain, pretending to find something to find, ride someone, jump down from the cliff on the mountain...\\nKashgar is 200 kilometers from the three forks. Three forks on the road in Bachu County, is a major traffic road, two cliffs on the side of the road, very dangerous. Chen Qiang chose here. \\nChen Qiang jumped off from the cliff. The Director of Public Security woke up from his dream and knew that Chen Qiang had compiled a story, let him escort him to commit suicide. In fact, there was no secret belief at all. \\nLater, a friend of the task force told Zhou Tao that Chen Qiang did not expose you. It was Chen Qiang's wife who exposed you. The day Zhou Tao went to Chen Qiangjia, she was in the kitchen and never came out. After Zhou Tao left, Chen's wife asked who the person was, Chen said Zhou Tao's name. \\nChen Qiang is trustworthy. \\nWhen Chen Qiang died, his wife Zhuang Jing married the teaching director of a school in Shufu County. It is said that the dean is not very good. \\nChen Qiang once showed Ma Chinyan a poem he wrote, showing that he wanted to follow Mao Zedong's heart. \\nAfter Ma Qinyan was out of prison, one day he said to Qi ming that Chen Qiang brought you a message saying that he, 'followed Chairman Mao!' \\nMa Chinyan said that words inadvertently and dull, after listening to the face no reaction...\\nYego sent Qi Army back to Nanjing. First, he provoked things here, and then he didn't want to let his already older son watch his parents get rounded up. \\nAdoptive mother alignment army bad. The way to school is far away, the rice is not delicious brown rice, and buy him a piece of tofu milk in the meal, she is eating rice cooked at home. The child is growing, and here Yego cooking is still nutritious. She used to bring tofu milk, Qi Jun did not write to her mother. Yego's sister-in-law wrote a letter. At first, Yego thought that their mother-in-law had a bad relationship, whether he said gossip. The sister-in-law said that once her dumplings had fetched a bowl for Qi Jun, the adoptive mother did not eat him, but eaten it himself. Since then, Yego wrote to his son every time he wrote two dollars in the letter. Think he can buy fritters when he is hungry. The adoptive mother is a small citizen's thought, and there is no culture, and she cannot be transformed in half a while. It's not easy to know that she can bring children. Yego did not complain about him. Once Qi Jun came back to school early, the meal did not eat, went on the road to see the meat bun bought by Grandma, while walking to eat. It turned out that the family life was difficult, and this son understood. Understand, he did not say either. The adoptive father prayed Wang Songsheng, the son of his brother, had always been good to Yego, and Yego called his brother. On one occasion Qi Jun bought a bottle of wine and went to Uncle Songsheng's family and told him the real situation. Wang Songsheng just wrote to Yego. Qi Jun also understood his own mistakes, learning has also fallen back. One day worried about whether his parents are fighting and approving again. One or two days later, he scared no way, and thought about that. And Yego's adoptive mother returned to Qi Jun, 'Your mother's salary has not yet been sent for this month. We are almost no money to spend!' Her words shocked the child one day. After Yego received this letter, he wrote a letter to Anhui's mother, saying that Qi Jun's life in Nanjing was unsatisfactory. It was very hurt to him. Can you accept him? Mother said yes, as long as you rest assured. They sent a man to Nanjing to get the Qi army to rural Quanjiao County, Anhui. \\nQi Jun said to her mother, pro is not the same. Grandma often asked me to change clothes, she got to the river to wash clothes, so cold water on a cold day, I did not accidentally go, robbed can not come. The house killed a pig, marinated there, every time cooking, cut a few pieces of rice, steamed, eat it. Grandma never remember the cost of living did not, sometimes you send it a few days later, I said Grandma, my mother hasn't sent the cost of living! Grandma said, ah, your mother does not come to parasitism for half a year, and I can feed you. You know, I don't know, this row of trees in front of our door, this is what I used for shoushou wood. As long as you help a hand, we sell a tree, it's enough for us to eat for a month or two! \\nSon listened, very moved, wrote to her mother. At the end of the letter said that my grandmother was really good. She was tired and sometimes rolled a cigarette. She also said, 'Qi Jun, do you smoke no smoke?' She was confused and even she wanted me to smoke...'\\n20\\nIn August 1978, the Kashgar Land Committee held a working meeting with 226 participants. The meeting was held for half a month, one of which was to basically identify nine aspects of Kashgar related to the 'gangs of four' activities, 16 major events, preliminary mapping out of the region's key target target 158 people. There were 361 people who needed to explain the problem, 31 people were beaten, smashed and robbed the first evil elements. Eight people have been arrested, the rest. To be further identified and processed. On December 5, the local committee committee and municipal committee committee in Kashgar city people's square jointly held a criminal conference on Lin Biao and Jiang Qing anti-revolutionary group. On the same day, Bachu County held a general assembly to openly defuse the 'treason to the Soviet bloc' in the Cultural Revolution. \\nMore than 20 days later, in 1979. \\nOn January 11, 1979, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), made a decision on the issue of capping landowners and wealthy farmers, and on the composition of land and rich children. In mid-February, the Southern Xinjiang Military Region held a 'rehabilitation conference' to restore reputation for the mistakes suffered in the 'Cultural Revolution' of the former party committee secretary of the Southern Xinjiang Military Region and the First Political Commissar, Zeng Guangming. On July 13, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), issued a 'Notice on Resolving and Correcting Problems of Right-Leaning Opportunists'. On November 30, the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee issued a notice on handling the issue of censorship materials in the Cultural Revolution movement, noting that in the 'Cultural Revolution', Lin Biao and the 'Gang of the Four' have created a large number of false and false cases, and about 2 million cadres have been filed for review across the country. \\nFrom a series of messages, Ziming saw the turnaround. \\nFrom the beginning of the 'three and five anti-five', Qi ming has been stirred repeatedly by anti-Hu wind, anti-right, anti-right, cultural revolution, inspection and approval campaign again and again. By 1988, when the return was settled, for more than 30 years, it was somehow reduced grade 4. More than 30 years, less at work, more time, there are idle places when no one asks. In the next 30 years, he wrote a registered letter to the Central Disciplinary Commission, there was a kutsu. \\nComplaints of the letter sinking sea. \\nHe doesn't know how the poor can't afford to go to school is divided into a rich farmer? \\nJust read his 'Unforgettable Childhood' poem in his Road Song, how can he not say that he is a 'class alien', and he is a counter-revolutionary. \\nStill unknown, Qi ming's heart is full of difficulties on the world: 'high sky why blue blue, why the earth is dense valley rivers?' After understanding, he saw human suffering and asked, 'Why is this darkness in human beings, who divides people into poor and rich? Why are there so many inequalities in human beings, and how can the rich bully the poor?' When seeing the innocent lie in the blood, when he heard the crying of the orphan and widow, he suffocated and silently sworn to avenge the suffering. \\nSummer harvest was stolen to rent; a sister could not feed abandoned wilderness after birth; sister Xiuwen was forced to marry by the landlord at thirty nights, deduction of debt to pay a thousand rings a hang whip... Ziming had to drop out of school. He wandered in the field and cried with grief and indignation: 'I want to read, I want to be equal, I want to go to school, I want to tell the world the brutal imbalance of humanity! However, he broke his tongue, hammered his breasts and feet, only the burning hearts of the bear and bear anger. A teacher came to him, pulled his hand to home and took a book from the bookshelf: 'Look at this old man, his name is Gorky. He is as poor as you are to learn, and suffering people have given him knowledge not in the book.' Society is a university, he wandered everywhere, pedal across Russia's rivers and mountains, learned to live and learn to acura...\\nSince then, Qi ming learned that he can also study without going to school. In order to declare war against the old world, you must learn the skills to combat! \\nWinter, cold wind, sunset, seven bodies still struggled in blood. Qi ming left the prison in a heavy footstep, in his heart asking: late into the house of the vast people, wanting to cut off the heart of the enemy is a death sin? There is no Chai Wo at home, the child frost crying, cut off a dead tree from the landlord's house. Should he be convicted of burying alive? Poor people are revolving, you want to have a sunlight? He walked into the ancient tomb grove and asked the cold stone horse: 'What is the king?' \\nEver since Ziming knew that the gun could kill, he fell in love with the gun. The father made a wooden gun for him, tied with red silk spikes, lacquered black shiny, hanging on the body during the day, on the night. At the age of 9, a team of Feng Yuxiang passed from his hometown, Qi Ming followed a day and a half, was recovered by his father. Dad said, 'Silly boy, this is the KMT soldier! Waiting for the poor, I will send you to be a soldier!' \\nIn 1938, his father sold the cattle as a road fee to make him go to Yan'an. Mother wrapped a bag of hometown soil, handed in his hands...\\nQi ming thought of these on fire: how to participate in the revolution once again became the object of revolutionaries? \\nHe made a special trip back to Xi'an and Henan. Li Yuzhi, who joined the army with him as chief of staff in the Xi'an Military Region, wrote a certificate to prove his home as a child; and went back to his hometown to find people and communes who took his hand and said 'it was his own comrades', correcting the farmer ingredients misclassified as rich farmers. \\nQi ming continued to write complaints to the Xinjiang Autonomous Region and the Central Disciplinary Commission. \\nGu Jingsheng knew Qi ming's complaint and asked him to come to Urumqi. \\nGu Jingsheng was born in 1913 in Linyi, Shanxi, participated in revolutionary activities in 1929, and then to Beiping, have participated in the left union, social association and anti-imperialist alliance, joined the Communist Party of China in 1932. Participated in the leadership of the '12.9' movement, participated in the War of Resistance against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the United States for North Korea. Mrs. Fan Chengxiu, 14 years old to participate in the revolution. When the guerrilla captain of the Eighth Route Army, he was a famous talented woman and women's rescue cadre in Taihang Mountains during the resistance. In the fight against the right, he was the deputy director of the Political Affairs Office of the Beijing For speaking on behalf of a teacher named Peng, he was classified as the right. But she refused to sign the 'right' conclusion. Therefore, he was expelled from the party and escorted a farm in Daxing County to supervise labor. \\nThe rank of the whole army was hit on the right, but Chen Yi, Minister of General Affairs and Culture Minister Chen Yi; the wife of the senior cadre of the army was classified as the right, but Gu Jingsheng was a man. Xie Fuji asked Gu Jingsheng to talk to him and advised him to divorce his wife. Fan Chengxiu was afraid of even tired husband, and also proposed a divorce, but all were categorically rejected by Gu Jingsheng. For this reason, Gu Jingsheng was removed from office from the Fifth Courtyard of the Ministry of Defense and assigned to Xinjiang. Seven years in prison in the Cultural Revolution, 12 years before and after the quarantine examination. Resumption of work after the rehabilitation, served as deputy political committee of Guangzhou Military Region. February 1981 transferred Xinjiang to serve as the second secretary of the CPC Committee of the Autonomous Region. Fan Chengxiu is deputy minister of propaganda. \\nGu Jingsheng listened to Qi Ming's plea and promised to give him a complete resolution and reinstatement of some of the issues at his previous level. \\nWhen the Standing Committee of the District Party Committee met to study the issue of Qi ming, Gu Jingsheng met in Beijing. Fu Wen said at the meeting that it was not conducive to the settlement. \\nOnce again, the issue of Qi ming has become a legacy. \\nFuwen, Shanxi Pinglu people, born in April 1921, college culture, in May 1938 in Yan'an resistance to participate in the revolution. From Jinnan Daily to Xinjiang Daily in the beginning of liberation. Deputy president, president, district party committee propaganda department. My love works in the Xinjiang Daily, left. On the right, she and several women activists in the newspaper encouraged the right lady to leave the right husband. Persecuted by the rebellion of power in January 1967, and in September 1970 it rose again. He was a Standing Committee member of the Autonomous Region Party Committee when he studied Qi ming's grievances. \\nThe head of the office of the Ministry of Public Information told Qi ming about it. The head of the office is Wang, and then redeployed to the Xinjiang Office in Beijing. He told Qi ming when he ran Xinjiang's 'Branch Life', that you take a few poems, and I give you the publication in 'Branch Life'. \\nThe matter of Fu Wen falling down a stone on the Standing Committee, other people also told Qi ming. \\nQi ming said I had not done a worried thing, did not say someone else a bad word, but let someone say a word to death. \\nAfter Gu Jingsheng came back from Beijing to know this, stamped his foot and said, 'Oops, how am I so confused! How can I not think of the next file if I did not solve anything earlier? ...'\\nFan Chengxiu aligns that I know too much the taste of being blessed by people, and I am also implementing the policy to work again. I know this pain, ask for something. She also aligned her statement that what politics is, politics is conspiracy. Politics are not like those singers and artists that earn, they have real talents. \\nAfter Wang Enmao returned to work in Xinjiang, Valley View left Xinjiang. \\nQi Ming continued to write letters to the Central Disciplinary Commission, and also wrote to Wu Guanzheng. \\nAt the end of the Cultural Revolution, when workers were stationed at the left of the factory, the Guardian Education and Reform Commission also made Yego their dependent object. Yin Jing, research and research group on pathology, let Yego participate in the party. Yego also said, 'Although he is not a member of the party, in fact, his ideas have long been party members. When the Cultural Revolution didn't work, he was still working on his pathology lab, and the Finance Office supported him to make ten large cabinets for specimens, nothing was delayed...'\\nAfter the meeting, Zhang, director of the TCM teaching and research team came to Ye Ge's home and said, 'Big Sister Ye, you have a lot of weight to speak. How can you say that he was ideally part of the party? He walked the white franchise road, and those bourgeois white franchise routes he gave to Hapitzimin! \\nYe Ge understood that he knocked the wrong place on the drum, and the struggle in the school was fierce! \\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, Hapizi Yimin was beaten to send money to work abroad for rehabilitation, only paid living expenses without wages. Hapizi's mother had no money for medical treatment due to the illness of her children, and he cried after seeing Yin Jingzheng. Yin Jingzheng quietly gave the old lady dozens of yuan without thinking. Actually, he is not rich either. Later, he was written in his large newspaper, saying that he bought the hearts of people. Ye Ge thought that in that age, the buyer's heart would also need to find a powerful and powerful person on stage, ah, he didn't know that there would be cadres 'liberated' in the future! \\nYe Ge believes that Yin Jing is receiving a good family education and has good quality, so she said, 'Although he has not joined the party, the idea is long ago the idea of the party members!' \\nIn 1985, the organization found Yego, saying you can join the party. The kids all said, 'Mom, you are about to retire, and you are unjust officials. What do you do to get back to that party? Are you less suppressed by party rejection! In addition to joining the party and paying the party fee!' \\nQi ming disagreed with the children, saying, 'You don't think about the economy, I think you're still in the party. You are so active at work, my old comrade, and my wife is not a party member? Somebody asked about it!' \\nSo Yego became a member of the Communist Party of China. \\nQi ming and Ye Ge did not get the whole, let Qi army, who is going to high school in Anhui, return to Kashgar. \\nQi Jun did not go to college. He wants to join the army. Once the people who recruit understand that he has provoked things, they will not accept it. Those who came to recruit troops from Lanzhou, commander named Chen, were comrades of Qi Ming. Yego explained to him not all explained. Qi Jun was disappointed. The Kashgar Guard School and the Kashgar Land Committee were recruited at the same time, because the mother had been neatly at the guard school, and the army was resolutely unable to come to the He was recruited to the Land Commission. Health school radiology, dental examination technicians, many people enrolled. He was reluctant to take the test. Assigned to the health school after graduation. Later, he took the first place in the area, and engaged in electro-teaching in schools. \\nQi Jun took part in the first month of work and paid a salary, he said:\\n'Mom, go, we go to the pharmaceutical company!' \\nYego said, 'What to do to pharmaceutical companies?' \\n'I'm going to buy my grandmother a hearing aid for my first month's salary!' \\n'Well, you have a good idea. I agree!' \\nQi Jun picked one of the best Japanese imported hearing aids for Grandma. He did not have enough money, Yego added a little more. After buying it, immediately sent back to Grandma. \\nIn 1986, Yego returned to Anhui to visit his family, sleeping at the bed of his mother. Yego heard a 'chirp' sound in the bedside table. \\n'Mom, there are rats!' \\n'Ah, that's not a mouse. It's my hearing aid. It's the hearing aid that my grandson bought me. I'm not off!' \\n'Why don't you need it?' \\n'I will not use it!' \\n'You shouldn't use it, you're still on, isn't it the same! You use it, bad, buy you again!' \\nThe mother's door has a common well, the wellhead is built with stone, and the mother wipes the well along the clean, shiny every day with a rag. The wipes used by the mother were in vain. Qi ming said: 'Yego, you hurry to throw your face towel away, you see the mother's wipes are cleaner than your towel!' \\n21\\nIn 1988, Zhongji appointed a special person to Xinjiang to give Qi ming to implement the policy, let Qi ming come to Urumqi. \\nLi Zhilian, who was appointed by Middle Registry, is an old comrade who is older than Qi ming. \\nQi Ming met Li Zhilian and talked about his own problems and his own requirements and ideas. The Central Disciplinary Commission gave Qi ming's question to Xinjiang Disciplinary Commission below. A director of the Xinjiang Disciplinary Commission asked Qi ming to talk to Qi ming, saying that you should not pursue so much responsibility for the implementation of your policies. Yanan AB regiment,How many people are wronged,Many people are executed,You can survive is lucky...\\nSimming straight heart soft, others say three good words he doesn't mention anything. Yego saw him too well, and often went to the district party committee for propaganda department, organization department, and disciplinary committee. The reception of Yego was a secretary with the name of the stone. He had a good relationship with Huang Ming. He also passed Yego's words to Huang Ming. Huang Ming is the family of Sister Qi Ming. Ye Ge went to the Lao Gan Bureau, and a director of the surname Zhang aligned with his sympathy. He also heard of Siming, saying he was a very competent person when he was young. He said that the old trans have happy road, Yan'an Road, and old mancity old dry houses. Wenlian people said that the cadres of Wenlian were in Yan'an Road, and lived there for good management. That surname Zhang said to Yego that you don't go to Yan'an Road. I suggest you go to the old city to do a rest place. There is a more qualified cadre who can go, Qi ming's qualifications are old enough. \\nOld Mancheng dry house house format is the same, a row of four of the hall level, a row of six of the deputy hall level. By level, Qi ming can only enjoy the deputy level treatment, live in a row of six families. Yego said that my children had many children, all of whom were not enough to live. None of them had an official unit, and an old mother. \\nAs soon as Yego looked at the situation, he said I didn't want this house. Let's solve the problem at the hall level. Qi ming's early liberation was the hall level, somehow down level 4, now more than 30 years have passed, or vice office level? She went to the organization minister Chen Sif. \\nChen Sifu came up to the party of Bao Wang Enmao's 'Three Promotion Association', and he knew that Qi Ming had suffered grievances. As soon as he heard that Qi ming also had to implement the issue of treatment of officials at the office level, he said that it was good, he approved a house for the treatment of office-level cadres. \\nThe people who oversee the implementation of the policies of the Central Discipline Commission have not yet left, so Qi ming moved his home to Urumqi, only those who implement the policy can go. \\nQi ming returned to Kashgar. \\nThe Board asked him to pay the party fee for more than 30 years. Qi ming said that he only gave me a paper of counteraction, and a penny of the salary has not yet been made up, let me pay what? I have neither seen documents nor enjoyed any political treatment in these decades, and my salary turned out to be 12, muddled, and without the next document, I was down to level 16. Pay the party fee, you can! You paid me all my wages for the previous decades, I don't pay a penny, all the party fee...\\nQi ming and Yego are about to leave Kashgar, and the people they once had interacted have heard the news. Most of the people who used to work in the salt farm in Sheep Daman also went to Shule County or Kashgar. Nie Dingbo went to a fishing farm under the Shufu County Water Conservancy Bureau. Several sons of you Xiangxiu also worked in Shule County government departments; and Yang Liping still opened a photo gallery in Kashgar. Tang Qigui found Qi ming home on the first day of his release from prison, kneeling to Qi Ming, and said with pain, I didn't listen to you, did not read a good book. I was in prison. \\nIn the midsummer of 1989, Qi ming left Kashgar, Yang Liping couple and He Shuying couple for Qi ming, Ye Ge...\\n22\\nThe old mancity is located in Hyperlink 'http://www.baike.com/wiki/%E4%B9%8C%E9%B2%81%E6%9C%A8%E9%BD%90\\\\\\ o 'Urumqi'\\\\ t '_blank' Urumqi Southwest, east side of Nanchang Road crossing road. \\nOld Mancheng built in Qing Hyperlink \\http://www.baike.com/wiki/%E4%B9%BE%E9%9A%86\\\\\\ o 'Qianlong' Qianlong 37 years \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\"

When the Qing Dynasty was in the center of military rule in Urumqi, the city moved to a full battalion of officers and soldiers, so people called it 'old mancity'. In the autumn and winter of 1842, the relegated Lin went to the city. Qing Hyperlink 'http://www.baike.com/wiki/%E5%90%8C%E6%B2%BB\\\\\\ o 'Tongzhi' for three years, Gongning city destroyed in war. During the war of resistance, teachers and students of Xinjiang Provincial Normal School built a new school building on the ruins of the old city. In 1943, the KMT army occupied and expanded into 38 Divisions and 5 Divisions of the Army. After liberation, in 1952, built the Bayi Agricultural College, referred to as Bannong, later renamed Hyperlink 'http://www.baike.com/wiki/%E6%96%B0%E7%96%86\\\\\\ o 'Xinjiang' Xinjiang Agricultural University. \\nFrom Nanchang road into Badong campus, go straight left through eight farm family area, right hand west look at a gate, door two meters high on the fuchsia marble wall, there are 'old city old cadres in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region recuperation home' two lines of golden yellow characters. Campus large trees, woodwood Yu, buildings mastered, elegant environment. The rest house is far from the hustle and bustle, quiet abnormal. Siming lives in the second row of the left hand into the gate to the west. Unique small courtyard, the courtyard has arches Tenglo Gallery frame, the diagonal diagonal of the courtyard has two more grasp trees, an apricot tree, an elm. The courtyard is filled with a variety of pot flowers on the ground and on the windowsill. \\nAfter Qi ming moved here, Li Zhilian's wife of the Central Disciplinary Commission returned to him a letter asking about the implementation of the policy. Yego wrote back, saying that it was for us to implement the policy. In fact, nothing was given to us, but only gave a certificate of rehabilitation and a set of old houses in Urumqi; just restored party membership and asked for party fees; the post of deputy chairman of the Autonomous Region of the Federation was not notified, only a few years later.; nor did he participate in the activities of WWF. As soon as the people of the Central Discipline Commission go, there is nothing...\\nLanzhou Civil Affairs Bureau came a letter, talking about 30 yuan borrowed by the Civil Affairs Bureau of Lanzhou during the Yego Cultural Revolution. Yego quickly wrote a letter to apologize and sent back the money. When she told Qi ming about this matter, she remembered another thing that was worthwhile: to Beijing for a petition, in order to get some money, sold more than a dozen yuan and a pound of wool to sell more than 20 yuan. The two also spoke of people and things in those years of suffering, some things that make people feel for a lifetime, and some family things seem to be dumb eating yellow and suffering. \\nQi ming said that a liter of rice raised a benevolent, a bucket of rice raised an enemy. Rice is less, a person will get his feelings; Mi more, he will smash what you gave him less, did not eat full... They previously denounced Zhang Wei, saying she slapped Qi Bin. Now it seems that what they say is one side of the word. I don't think it's exactly Zhang Wei's fault based on their way to you. I ran in Urumqi to implement the policy, lived in my sister's house for a few days and never cook, I had to cook for them. Stayed for a few days, I still want to eat. Without food costs, chase me...\\nQi ming moved to Urumqi Old Mancheng Dry House five years after a spring, Zhou Tao rang the door of Qi ming. \\nZhou Tao knows that it shouldn't be dragged to see him until now. Drag to now, he can't say what psychological reason is. This drag has been dragged down for more than a decade, 20 years since the Kashgar Board criticized Qi ming that year. For 20 years, Qi ming has been looking for a path in the jingchus, reviewing and complaining about the snow, while Zhou Tao, with a poet's dream, has now published books such as 'Illusionist's Medical Records', 'Rare Birds', 'Zhou Tao's Choice' and other works, and has become a poet, and is a very good poet, and different in the field of prose Military protrusions became a symbol of Xinjiang literature, and the country is also very famous. \\nQi Ming met Zhou Tao, neither particularly surprised nor too enthusiastic, and at the same time there was no blame. \\nThe two sat down, tested each other, slowly followed with the memory of 20 years ago. \\nZhou Tao does not seem to be much older than 20 years ago, but the legs and feet are not convenient before, and that head has not changed. He is the kind of dwarf man, stout and powerful; above his stout neck, black hair, gray hair, white hair on the flat bristles are generally upright up, never bent. His mouth shape also embodies stubbornness, as if a door that was always vigilant and closed. It's also like a wound that is closed to some kind of heart. And his eyebrows were twenty years ago, but more white and longer, deep on the eyes, there is a very moving, experience of the vicissitudes of sorrow and melancholy. These are two extraordinary eyebrows, like the white eyebrows imagined in ancient rivers and lakes. His bones are deep in the style of big characters. \\nSpeaking of the first time, Zhou Tao actually remembered the first place he knew him, and thought it was the time he moved to the health school drunk. Qi Ming squinted and looked at Zhou Tao and laughed and said, 'Look at you, you forgot. I knew you and you were not in the health school at the first time. We are very connected, you come, we drink alcohol.' \\n... to stay with rice and drink alcohol as usual. Iizama Yego mentioned Chen Qiang, a while sentimental. After meals, the two people talked about literature. Zhou Tao visited Qi ming's study room. Qi ming's study is spacious and sunny, clean and dust-free. There are many books, ranging from early yellowish editions to several series selected by the newly published North Normal University. In a series of books that frequently read on a few cases, Zhou Tao discovered the 'Zhou Tao's Choice' with a blue cover and a reading sticker in the book page. \\nChen Hengfu came to Xinjiang from Tianjin and asked about Qi ming's home, and came to visit him again. Chen Hengfu studied himself and was arrested because of his words. After coming out of the 'high wall' to teach at Kashgar Normal College, he returned to a university in Tianjin to teach, and wrote academic articles such as 'On Rousseau's Literary Achievements' and 'Gong Zizhen and Today Literature', and became a highly educated scholar. Seeing Chen Hengfu, Ye Ge remembered Chen Qiang, if he does not 'follow Chairman Mao' jumping cliff, will certainly also have achievements in some aspects...\\nDing Lang from Beijing back to Urumqi, often to the old mancheng Qi ming family to chat. The two talked about the Cultural Revolution and Wang Enmao. \\nWang Enmao returned to Xinjiang and made many mistakes. Whoever protected me, I promoted whoever, it was very bad. Later Wang Enmao had no prestige, related to this. For example, Zheng Jianguo, secretary of the Political and Law Commission of the Autonomous Region, is to be appointed by the National People's Congress Committee. But this man is such a large officer, who was originally an officer of the Military District Defence Department who took photographs. This man before the Cultural Revolution, oilhead noodles love to dress up, married a Shanghai wife. The Military District Defence Department had held a live exhibition at his home. Zheng Jianguo is a villain in the Cultural Revolution, and participated in Wu Guang's task force in the Cultural Revolution. To defeat Black Wuguang, Wang Enmao is happy. After Wang returned to Xinjiang, he was transferred to the political and legal committee of the Autonomous Region. Wang Enmao, a living secretary, transferred, step by step into the Standing Committee of the Autonomous Region, and later became deputy secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee. Chen Xifu was also a family member of Baowang Enmaoji. Later, he went to the office of the Standing Committee of the Autonomous Region and Minister of Organization. Many of the old cadres of the Second Army were very dissatisfied, so his prestige fell. Before the Cultural Revolution there was no gossip of Wang Enmao, but when he went to Xinjiang for the second time, he had his scandal...\\nZeng Guangming moved to the Fujian Military Region after his return to office. Once he came back to see a doctor at the General Hospital of the Military Region, he sent people to tweet Qi. He said with tears, 'Old Qi, I didn't help you, you still need no food tickets now?' Say, just pull out a lot of food tickets from your pocket. Qi ming said: 'You are good to me, I already appreciate you!' \\nQi ming guilty is always wanting to write about his combat career, but life has been unstable and did not have a chance to interview him. \\nSiming was either creative or reading in his study. He wrote the film literary script of 'The Soul of the Desert' on behalf of a film company in Shenzhen in Hong Kong. He was familiar with Wang Robin, an old comrade, and personally interviewed Rosan in Kaifeng, Henan. After the script was written, it was shown to the people of the Hong Kong Shenzhen Film Company that they would put Qi ming's name in second place. Qi ming rejected this unjustified request silently. \\nIn 2002, Li Jinxing, the officer of the Wenlian senior office called Qi Ming, saying that Laoqi was an elderly man of the Wenlian, and that the old cadres of the Autonomous Region organized tourism for the healthy elderly, a quota for each unit, there were more than 100 cadres retired by Wenlian. If you want to line up, I think that old age is also older. Again, old comrades, give you this quota first...\\nSiming is grateful. \\nQi ming and Yego went to Chengdu, Kunming, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and then went back to Nanjing to see Yego's brother, and went to the tomb of her mother in Quanjiao County, Anhui. \\nOne day, Qi ming came across Wang Yuhu when he went to Wen Lian's salary. Qi Ming said to Wang Yuhu, 'Do you have any opinion on me in the end? What the hell am I doing?' Wang Yuhu said: 'You are mainly not close to us!' Qi ming came back and said, 'How do I get closer to you? Is it not asking you to eat or drink with you?' \\nLiu Xiaowu and Wang Yuhu have served as secretaries of the WPF group after Qi Ming. \\nWhen Qi ming and Yege went to contact the ward at the high dry ward of medical college, they met Li Jinxing, who had been in the old office of the Wenlian. He also gave Liu Xiao no contact ward One night, Li Jinxing suddenly called Qi Ming, saying:\\n'I told you good news. After I met you that day, I told Liu Xiao without his wife, saying you were also hospitalized here. His wife told Liu Xiaowu the news. On the occasion of Liu Xiao's absence, his wife said to him that Qi ming is also hospitalized here now! After listening to Liu Xiao, it was like saying to her, and said himself, the most sorry thing in my life is Qi ming!' \\nQi ming heard this word, and was silent for a long time, saying, Man shall die, and his words are good. \\nQi Ming's little brother Qi Bin, is also a very straight man. After demobilizing the troops to the Toutunhe District, retired in the post of Secretary of the Toutunhe District Disciplinary Commission. Later, I apologized to Yego, 'I really sorry for you. I was young and intelligible...'\\nQi Xin lived in Datong after retirement, often call, let his brother and sister-in-law pay attention to the body. \\nYang Liping in Kashgar and Nie Dingbo all call to call back to Wuhan He Shu-Ying in Hubei, Hubei, and call every Qi ming birthday to wish his birthday. \\nOn May 18, 2013, He Shuying, Gong Yuying couple rushed from Wuhan East Lake to Urumqi Old Mancheng dry rest for Qi ming wishes. \\nMay 21 is April 12, the ninety-birthday of Qi ming. \\nThe next day, he and his couple returned by car. Thousands of miles, train round trip, stay for 5 days, no other tour, just to wish! \\nWhy? \\nIs Ziming's character makes him admiration and admiration! \\nQi ming's three sons Qi Jun, Qi Tao, Qi Bing, along with a life of bumpy parents have been deeply hurt, they see color is the same color as night, character also like the trunk of hawthorn tree. They don't join the party, saying that we don't say you are good, you have not been full enough?! The eldest son is the head of the ethnic class in the Department of Radiology, Xinjiang Medical College. He was a workaholic, as a class leader down a year and his hair was white. Got hypertension died. When he died, his son was five years old. Those Uighur students miss him very much, writing an article in the school newspaper to commemorate him, saying, 'If there was no teacher Qi, there would be no us today!' \\nQi Tao, the unit let him be the factory director, do his own company. The daughter-in-law is a doctor at the Tuberculosis Hospital. \\nQi Bing was a doctor at the CDC, and his childhood pulled his stomach without timely treatment, nutrition could not keep up. He was removed from anal, and several operations could not be cured. He has unspeakable sufferings. The lover seems to be sick, and his sons go to high school, still broke up with him. Yego's brother came from Kunming. Qi Bing and his uncle drank alcohol, his nephew drunk, the melt in Qi Bing's heart completely erupted. Like a torrent of thousands of shoots, he said loudly to my mother: 'I was only 1 year old, I sent me. I sent people, how good I didn't say I was good, her daughter, not so, said she was good. I pulled her belly, she was a hospital nurse and didn't know to go show me, let me pull it off the anal, and I was sick for life. You can't afford to raise me, you don't keep me. What do you send me? ...'\\n'Woowhining-'\\nYege also tears, and the voice choked, saying, 'Your father is not known for life or death, no life can be seen dead, I do not go to him, who will go to him?

It may be the condition and character that makes me unconnected to these, but I am willing to be in the words of others. In constant reading, I was inspired by the intention to 'look'. On the way 'looking', I went to one person after another. These people, who live at the bottom and on the margins of society, are like a black relict left behind in the big times. Their path of life has been bright, bumpy, twists and tribulations, but their character, or the light overflowing from the mind, spirit, soul, shines there, connected to a landscape of the mind. \\nInterview with Ding Lang, he talks about a small story of Qi Ming. \\nAt the 'anti-right' non-party literary symposium in the military region, Ding Lang talked about 'the reflection of sectarianism in the field of literature and art, that is, xenophobic, self-esteem, only my own esteem', citing the manifestations of sectarianism in the army, said that there was anti-six army sentiment in the Second Army. The tendency of the regiment, 'In the way of leading sectarian ideas, upward and down, for some comrades Causes great damage.' \\nHe also took Dinsin and Ziming as an example. \\nFrom Ding Long's mouth, hear the name of Ziming again. \\nWhat damage did Ziming take? What hurts him? 'Great', 'great' to what extent? \\nA series of question marks brought me closer to the old Mr. Siming. \\nQi ming lives in the old city dry rest. Old house, more than 160 square meters. His study has four or five bookshelves on three sides. The shelves are full of old books and now have more weight books, such as 'Gu Zhunwen', 'Diary of Gu Zhun', 'White Deer' and so on. \\nQi Ming, born in April 1924 in Henan Neixiang (now part of the Xixia), the family is chilling, misclassified as rich farmers. 1938 went to participate in the revolution. 1940 to Lu Xun College of Arts and Literature, and He Jingzhi, Li Ji are all classmates. Afterwards, in Yan'an Office, 'Force Life', 'Reference News', 'Press Briefing'. When Wang Zhen organized a corps of two or six armies into Xinjiang in Jiuquan, he moved from a field army to a regiment propaganda section chief. At that time, Wang Yuhu and Liu Xiaowu were chief of the arts section of the Second Army and the Sixth Army respectively. After the troops entered the country, Qi ming, together with Ma Hangbing and Saimaiazi, formed a three-member group of the JSC to take over Xinjiang literary and artistic circles. Qi Ming is the Chief of Military Administration and Director of Culture. He was also the first President of WIU. \\n'The Three Counters' when Qi Ming was in Wada. Liu Xiao's Working Group entered the WFU to put him down on charges of 'embezzlement, scalping gold and sheltering landlords'. Liu Xiaowu became Chairman of the WPF. After Qi Ming went to the Cultural and Arts Department of the Ministry of Propaganda, Lin Bomin was the propaganda minister. The two people had a dispute over the table over the table. When against the right, he was one of the five anti-right leadership groups in the autonomous region. Lin Bomin was the group leader. The other three were Liu Xiaowu, Wang Yuhu and Lin Peng. The late counterright again involved his family origin, and in the final discussion of the decision, he said, 'If it was not a class alien, it would not be dealt with'. He was devolved to Aksu, where 'class dissidents' had not yet been settled, but the decision to dismiss the party came. Lin Bomin's wife Wu Shaohua is the branch secretary of the district party committee organs. I wonder how this decision was made without myself attending the meeting? And in the absence of a decision document or any evidence, the salary scale somehow fell from 12 to 16, and the salary fell from 300 yuan to 186 yuan. \\nIn Aksu, Qi ming was arranged in a farmer's home in Hunbashi Township, and later to participate in the repair of multiple lanes. \\nAksu is 1012 km from Urumqi, not far. \\nIn the autumn of 1961, Qi ming received a notification to Kashgar. Kashgar is 1,480 km from Urumqi. Kashgar asked him to create a 'Red Flag Commune' film literary script and arranged him to Shule County Sheep Daman Commune. Named deputy governor. Cultural Revolution, tour street, batter, detained for 16 months...\\nAfter the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, there was chaos In his rebellion, Fu Wen said something that should not be said, causing his grievances to be delayed for a few more years. He complained again and again. It was only in 1988 that the Central Commission for Discipline Disciplinary Affairs came to a special person, and his grievances were resolved. By that time, he was 64 years old. \\nQi ming took part in the revolution in 1938 to 1988 for 50 years, during Yan'an, 11 years in Yan'an and 39 years in Xinjiang. The review during Yan'an can be ignored, while the real time worked in Xinjiang was only nine years, the remaining 30 years were spent in full, hit, discriminated against, battered, and guarded, while in the nine years of liberation, it was also bumpy and rain. A revolutionary youth with a heart of revolution, justice and blood have thus walked through his great years of desire for revolution, eagerly fairness and justice. When the revolution was successful in 1949, four or fifty years later became the deputy office level, wages for 40 years did not grow a level...\\nDing Long said that Qi ming suffered 'great' damage, it was 1957, compared to his next 20 years of life, can be said to be a nine-cattle. \\nQi ming, since childhood love of literature, embarked on the revolution for decades, read a lot of books, newspapers and magazines published a number of articles and poems, and in 1956 published a poem 'snow and snow Qilian Mountain'. During the decentralization of Aksu and Kashgar, his Xinjiang People's Publishing House is preparing to publish. All the figures were inserted. He came to Urumqi to revise the draft. He was aware of the propaganda minister Lin Bomin. Lin sent a document to the publishing unit, saying that Xinjiang now has a shortage of paper and that publishing is always directed to national comrades. Lin Peng called and asked Lin Boemin, and said: 'Han's older brother, uh, should be oriented towards the nation. He will figure it out. His book says later.' He wrote a short novel that has a tendency to return to human sexuality. In order to criticize, the editorial department said to be published again, with editorial press and Liu Xiaowu's critical article, became a living target of critical right-leaning criticism. \\nAlign Ming, Xinjiang is neither used, nor put. He wants to relocate to the PLA newspaper and the Wenlian of Henan Province, and Xinjiang does not agree. Several of the scripts he wrote were nowhere, and did not publish his articles, lively pressed him in Xinjiang, south of Tianshan, in Aksu, 1,480 kilometers from Urumqi Kashgar...\\nThree years after the disaster, Qi ming met a person in Urumqi, who asked, 'You are still alive! We all thought you were starved to death?' He was writing all his life, he was in repression. \\nQi ming integrity, sincerity, kindness, heart and chest. \\nIn Aksu Hunbashi Township, the landlord borrowed his matches every day, sometimes he gave a few pinch, sometimes a box, and sometimes a bag. Finally, he lit the lights without the match, and he borrowed from the landlord again. He went to the dorang district to repair a canal, the landlord Imin River rushed to a donkey cart, with Yang Gangzi (wife), and Ba (son), to see him, brought him pilaf and Sang Ren dry...\\nIn the Sheep Daman commune, those who came to the border were looking for him on a meal. Every time, Qi ming has let the lady Yego move stool and let people sit down for dinner. Sometimes he seems that people's clothes are broken and their shoes are rotten, but also let Yego find out old clothes and shoes for them to wear. The people of Shule County Civil Affairs Department arranged a blind flow from their mouth and asked, 'Where are you?' Say, 'sheep big man', ask another one, and also say 'sheep big man'. There are many people answering 'sheep big man'. People in the Civil Affairs Department have wondered about a dozen communes in Shule County, why do you prefer to go to Sheep Daman? And they answered, 'There is a Chief of Qi, and he is good to people...'\\nThe old man of Sheep Great Man gave him apricots, fish or anything, and he asked Yego to pay them, saying they were not easy, we still had wages. Cultural Revolution, Qi ming was held for 16 months sent back to Kashgar, from Shulle County back to Sheep Daman Commune, Klimu Township was angry, took off his neck fell for a few hours of big sign; labor back, indoor empty pan cold stove, the window sill often put good people to send him food, there are people to give him food, there are people to give him food Leave a strip to somewhere, send him dumplings to eat...\\nQi ming's wife Yego is also a bitter man, born in the sound of the shelling of Japanese aircraft bombing, from early childhood on the escape road from Nanjing to Hunan, to Chongqing, to Kunming, and back to Nanjing. Parental separation, transfer between biological, stepfather, adoptive father, birth mother, stepmother and adoptive mother. Yegobi Qi ming is 14 years old, she loves literature, loves poetry, and misery with Qi ming as a couple, is the sound of Ziming. She followed Qi ming much suffering, especially during the ten years of turmoil in the cultural revolution, accompany, accompany, and walk the street; Qi ming was arrested and his whereabouts were unknown; she took her children from Kashgar to Urumqi, money and food stopped living; went to Beijing, she went to Beijing, fearful; and bereaved by his loved ones. Disregard, cold down. The three sons also suffered in a deserted society. In their impressions, the parents were getting the whole, and what they saw was the ugly side, and what they were trying to do. The eldest son died a few years ago, the second son is still sad, the little son is still tormented by the aftermath of disease (anal), every day...\\nQi ming did not understand in his lifetime, how is the fate so twisty and twisting? \\nQi ming came to Wen Lian's salary, met Wang Yuhu. Qi Ming said to Wang Yuhu, 'Do you have any opinion on me in the end? What the hell am I doing?' Wang Yuhu said: 'You are mainly not close to us!' \\nA word from Wang Yuhu broke the sky. 'You', Qi Ming, one army; 'we', the second and the six armies. 'You' are transferred from one army, to a regiment of 'us' army two and six armies...\\nQi ming returned home and said, 'How do I get closer to you? Is it not asking you to eat or drink with you?' \\nLiu Xiaowu and Wang Yuhu have served as secretaries of the WPF group after Qi Ming. \\nWhen Qi ming and Yege went to contact the ward at the high dry ward of medical college, they met Li Jinxing, who had been in the old office of the Wenlian. He also gave Liu Xiao no contact ward One night, Li Jinxing suddenly called Qi Ming, saying:\\n'I told you good news. After I met you that day, I told Liu Xiao without his wife, saying you were also hospitalized here. His wife told Liu Xiaowu the news. On the occasion of Liu Xiao's absence, his wife said to him that Qi ming is also hospitalized here now! After listening to Liu Xiao, it was like saying to her, and said himself, the most sorry thing in my life is Qi ming!' \\nQi ming heard this word, and was silent for a long time, saying, Man shall die, and his words are good. \\nNow, although Qi ming has been high, the body is still healthy. He didn't remember anything about the past. Asking about the past, he said intermittently, 'I was taken up at that time! I think that was the beard! 'Woo ball is not right!' Speaking of the Cultural Revolution, he said: 'All Hu Ri ghosts, no ball meaning!' After asking more details, he said, 'I can't remember, really can't remember!' A sincere and helpless look, saying, 'That's all boring things! 'There are bad guys in the Communist Party.' He said, 'Lin Bomin doesn't have to be bad either. He is the minister. I am the staff!' Speaking of Liu Xiaowu, he said, 'I and Liu Xiao Wu said not to come. That man isn't like that. Not a force, he is of the six armies, character is also a bit wrong, and there is him in the middle of my people!' Ye Ge said that Liu Xiao's security officer Shi how expensive to make him the chief of section and let him expose Qi ming, he interpolated, 'What else do you say?' \\nYego said that during the Cultural Revolution and the children were sins and eating snow, crying was unsuccessful. And he said loudly, 'Say what is it?' Referring to the diary he wrote, he said, 'The diary has no look, I don't talk to him anymore!' He also said, 'I never said a bad thing in my life!' \\nEvery time I visited Yego, Yego said to Qi ming. Qi ming also asked:\\n'Do you want to write real names?' \\nYego said: 'It looks like you want to write the real name!' \\nQi said, 'So okay! Will it have a negative impact on society?' \\n...\\nScenic spots in the world can be seen and seen; and the hearts of people in the world, especially those great and noble souls, are not simply a person can see. Moreover, the more noble character is, the greater the soul is, and the more it is shielded by the powerful system and is often destitute by society, even if its name is less known. \\n'Finding the Way', cruising between the hearts and souls of people, I am often touched by these noble souls, as intoxicated by nature. From one point to another, in addition to the original power of the heart, there is the inspiration and inspiration of their noble souls. Continue their own footsteps, like carrying anything, a moment is not willing to stay, unusual urgency, so speed up the pace. Think about, which is to speed up the pace frequency of minutes, hours or even days, a sprint can read this dark landscape? This is like nature swim in nature, need stamina, tenacity, neither hurry nor too hurry, only keep walking, as to where to go, can see what scenery, that is no one who knows. \\nOn the way forward, there will be a scene, there will be a golden light shining in front of your eyes. \\n2011.11.4-2013.8.12\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 67"

For more than a year, it has been brainstorming for heating problems. The original design of the building lacked heating equipment, the building was built only after the temporary installation of heating. As a result, hit the walls, wear the floor, finally put the heating on. But it is said that the radiators are too few, so the heating is not warm, when the day is cold, the staff had to wear gloves for office. So, it was decided to spend another 26 million yuan to increase the radiator. However, the radiator increased, the temperature in the room did not increase, it was said that the root cause was the problem of heating routes. So a budget of 15 million yuan was created to repair the heating route. But where the problem is, it is said that the engineers don't know. Soon, winter came, the cold tide struck, the building's management agency had to come to an 'emergency measure', in the heating room to create a stove. The fire stove in the heating room tells us: Although it is not complicated works like installing heating, if there is a lack of careful planning and serious attitude, you must touch the nails.

In December 1950, we responded to the call of the Party and the government in the anti-US-DPRK movement to defend the country, and we voted from Rong to join the military cadre school on the same day. Due to work needs to be assigned to North China Bureau Party School of the CPC Central Committee. In July 1952, she joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in North China to work. In 1954, the region was revoked, she was assigned back to work with the Sino-Soviet Union Association in Shanxi Province. Sixty years ago, in 1957, she was falsely described as a 'right-wing,' two years of hard labour and 20 years of untouchability. A few decades later, when people asked what she was 'right', she said, 'It was a lot of suffering, but it was very comfortable. My suffering was not in vain, I personally participated in the construction of Fenhe and Kuaihe two reservoirs, and contributed to the people of Shanxi.' \\nMy big sister's distinctive thinking attracted me. So I asked her to talk about her situation. She showed me the autobiography she wrote and some of the historical documents that she had dealt with after 1957. I was deeply moved by the great mind of my older sister and the spirit of dedicated dedication to the people regardless of personal gains and losses. I had the same experience with her, but in different feelings, I often thought about personal, and under extremely bad conditions, she did not change her mind and wanted to do good for the country for the people. \\nSo, how did she suffer? \\nPayson said: 'In 1957, the whole country launched a whole wind movement and called for advice to the party. I have comments due to the wrong censorship in the counter-campaign. When a friend read the newspaper and read the remarks of right-wing elements attacking the anti-opposition movement, I inserted a sentence: 'Rebel is wrong with me.' 'I got a whole meal and said to help me.' This statement was denounced, saying that I 'attacked the anti-opposition movement', 'anti-party,' and therefore was classified as 'right-wing'. Extraction of registrations and public office, water conservancy teams supervise labor. On April 5, 1958, I was sent to Xiuhui River Reservoir, Quwo, Shanxi. Monthly living cost of 25 yuan (originally 20 administrative level, six categories of monthly salary of 70 yuan). After 100 days of hard work, the reservoir was completed, returned to Taiyuan on July 15. My father died on the day I returned to Taiyuan (July 15), because I became the right, sent to supervise the labor, and suffered a mental blow. It was a great deal of trouble at that time. It was not alone. Suffering to the extreme. One week after dealing with his father's aftermath, leaving two children (one 4 years old, one 3 years old), to his lover, went to the right team formed by Taiyuan Second Construction and Engineering Company to report to work, with a daily salary of 1 yuan 3 points 2 points. Despite the great pain and hardship I endured, I was still actively working, and was praised by the master workers. In the big steel, the labor is prominent, by the company conference commendation. In July, our right-wing team was transferred to the Hydroworks Corps into the seven squadron of three brigades, and was transferred to the Xiufenhe Reservoir. After day and night digging, trolleys, and dams, this is a great test for me a weaker woman. I endured super intensive labor, mosquito bites, physical overdrafts, down the day, to the evening, self-examination, criticized, mentally tortured. All of these I withstand with maximum resilience. In October 1959, our squadron held a general meeting, approved by the Taiyuan Municipal Committee, Taiyuan Municipal Personnel Bureau announced that I and Guo Yuanze both took off the right hat, withdraw supervision of labor sanctions. I was assigned to the Political Office of the Fenhe Reservoir directly under the Political Office of the Fenhe Reservoir to do \\nIn October 1961, the reservoir was completed, returned to the municipal construction two company trade union. \\nHaving listened to Payson's introduction, I was interested in these two reservoirs, so I went online to check it out. Sure, the reservoir did bring benefits to the people of Shanxi. Payson gave them no bitterness. \\n1、Kuaihe reservoir\\nShanxi Quwohui River reservoir is located in the middle of the huai river tributaries of the Fenhe River water system in the Yellow River basin, the dam site is located in Quwo County Shicun town West Jibi village south of the Huihe river The reservoir is one of the largest water reservoirs in Jinnan, the largest water surface, the most complete and functional one of the medium-sized reservoirs, the total reservoir capacity of 96.4 million cubic meters, normal water storage surface 15,000 acres. \\n2、Fenhe reservoir\\nFenhe reservoir is the largest reservoir in Shanxi province, located in the north of Shijiazhuang village in Loufan County. Full construction of Fenhe Reservoir commenced on November 25, 1957. Reservoir main project-dam, using soil structure (water pouring method), as the world's first precedent. The reservoir is 15 km north and south, 5 km wide east and west, with a total area of 32 square kilometres. Capacity is 700 million cubic meters, equivalent to 13 and a half times the capacity of the Tombs reservoir. Fenhe Reservoir is responsible for the safety of life and property of more than 6 million people in four cities and 18 counties in the middle and lower reaches of the Fenhe River. The construction of the Fenhe Reservoir also adds rare aquatic resources and beautiful tourist attractions to Loufan County. Shallow, medium and deep water fish in the library. There are more than ten species such as carp, crucian, yellow, grass, doll fish and many other aquatic animals such as lobster, turtle, turtle, turtle, crab. \\nIn Payson, there is a list of friends from the right team of Fenhe Reservoir. The transcription is as follows, let future generations know that among the hundreds of reservoir builders, there is such a special team. \\n1958 Shanxi Fenhe Reservoir Hydroworks Corps Three Squadron Seven Squadron\\n(Chipperson et al. Memories)\\nFan Baoquan, Zhang Guocai, Xi Xianlin, Du Zhanao, Zhang Chenglin, Yan Zhixin, Bai Peizeng, Yuan Zhijun, Hu Xianglin, Li Hanchu, Meng Zhen, Jiang Chuanjin, Qi Peisen, Zhu Xizhi, Wang Qi, Li Hongde, Dong Renzheng, Meng Xianbin, Nie Chongxin, Gao Yuanshuo, Wang Chengli, Li Qiyu, Niu Kechang, Li Huchun Zheng, Ren Weiyu, Fu Yutian, Liu Ying, Yang Yanzhai, Cui Xilie, Huang Zhichao, Sun Rong, Shi Zhanjia, Xiao Qiyuan, Yang Pusong, Zhang Lianfu, Yang Chenghai, Ping Songshan, Sun Yibin, Zheng Hengyi, Cheng Wangshui, Liu Xungao, Liu Jingkui, Tang Huaizhong, Wang Huaide, Sun Yongqing, Ma Zhongyuan, Zhang Jingping, Guo Dong, Yang Qiuhua, Liang Yu, Wen Xi, Chen Yu, Zhang Shuqi, Wu Lianxi, Li Ruixue, Guo Feng Rui, Guo Didong, Lei Zhiyu, Guo Liming, Pang Zhiqiang, Li Zengying, Liu Shu, Zeng Kennian, Liu De, Jing Puquan, Zhao Xi Kuan, Jia Zhaolin, Wang Futai, Liu Panhe, Guo Yuanze, Chen Guobin. 72 people. \\nIf the contribution and contribution are calculated, this group of people will pay much more than others. Because while working hard, they are also subjected to unparalleled mental torture. And later, it turns out that they have been wronged for 20 years. On the monument to the construction of these two reservoirs, they should be remembered with a great deal. \\nWhere is the injustice? In the right-wing 'correction' 20 years later, 100 per cent were 'corrected'. That is, none is wronged. It's all wrong. Then look at Payson's experience:\\nShe said: The Cultural Revolution broke out in 1966. 'Picking the right or right', my old athlete is also fleeing. Critically expose my big print. In addition to work, criticism must be accepted. So all day after three years. In 1970, cadres were decentralized, I was assigned to the Yangqu County Daobon commune. Wage relations were also transferred to the county, which fell to 45.5 yuan due to regional differences. In rural areas and social members eat and live with labor, autumn harvest turn over, hoe columbine target, like all dry. Physical energy is consumed a little larger, life is also more difficult, but with the farmers, the mood is more comfortable. They do not discriminate against me, sincerely treat each other, make a lot of friends. In 1973, after training, I returned to my original unit. Because far away from home, I took the initiative to transfer to Shanxi quartz factory, do logistics management work. Due to good job performance, after public comment, raised a level of 22, monthly salary 54 yuan 5 angle. \\nIn 1979, the Central Committee issued Document No. 55, 'correcting' the 1957 right-wing elements. But in the review it was found that there was no written conclusion in my file that year on my right. Say I'm not the right. But the dismissal stopped my 20-year salary, supervised labor for two years, wore a 20-year right-wing hat, and the family suffered, what happened? Finally, after finding and collecting evidence, Comrade Wang Ting, secretary of the propaganda department of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the CPC Taiyuan Municipal Committee, proved: 'Chipesen was definitely classified as the right in July 1958. It was discussed by branch departments and ministerial meetings, and reported to the superior leadership for approval. There were formal written conclusions. At that time, she was sentenced to dismissal of the group, dismissal from public office and supervision of labor.' \\nThe Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China thus concluded that: 'According to the Central Committee's document No. 55 and the 1957 criteria for dividing the right, (Chipesen), should not be classified as right-wing. To that end, it corrected the conclusions of the decision originally scheduled to be the right, and to revoke the original dismissal of the group. Public office, supervise labor sanctions, restore political honor, restore The original salary (four categories of monthly salary of 68 yuan 5 angle), arrange appropriate work. (See Propaganda Branch of Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, January 20, 1979, 'Corrective Conclusions on the Right Issue of Chipessen')\\n'It was only 20 years after the victimization that he learned that there was no definitive conclusion in his own file. Without the certification of Comrade Wang Ting, I'm afraid my black right hat will never be able to pick up. Where to appeal for 20 years of grievances? How I was persecuted is so far a mystery.' \\nJust because a few words were dissatisfied with her censorship, the life of an innocent youth was ruined. The father died prematurely as a result of mental stress. The lover is a Communist Party member and has been implicated by her to change jobs several times. Chronic depression overdeveloped cancer, died in 1980. \\nPolitically speaking 'correction' does not mean 'rehabilitation', the practical meaning is that wages owed for 20 years will not be paid. Not to mention moral compensation. Look at the time when dealing with the veteran cadres who were criticized in the Cultural Revolution, which one did not pay a repayment? Now that the person is wrong, it should be financially compensated when the wrong case is settled. Moreover, wages are the legal remuneration of staff members, and arbitrary withholding violates the legitimate rights and interests of citizens. Violation of both the labour law and the Constitution. As a Government, it would be unjust to treat its own people in this way. This is not a problem for Payson alone, 550,000 corrected right, all of them. How to deal with this historical account should be fair to the victims. 2017.3.1"

Communist Party members. Former Director of Defense Department of the Ministry of Finance, in 1956, studied at senior party schools. \\nQi joined the Kuomintang in 1928 and disconnected from relations in 1932, has already concluded. \\nFirst, the main reactionaries:\\n1. During the period, he complained about the corruption case of Guo Xinguang in Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, and found that he wrote four anonymous letters a year ago to the Central Committee and the relevant leadership comrades. In these letters, he carried out a vicious attack on the party and leadership. \\n(1), He said: 'Guo Xinguang actually has no embezzlement, it is public and private', falsely claiming that Guo Xinguang's case is a 'wrong prison.' \\n(2), The slander Guo Xinguang was beaten into a big tiger under the instructions of the Hebei Provincial Committee. And to describe the cadres and activists who lead the fight against tiger as 'having ulterior motives, emotionally useful things', compared these people to Tang Qin, saying that they are 'worse than Tang Qin', 'because these people have made Guo Xinguang a tiger's work, some have risen to officials and some fall activists.' And slandered rumours that: Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee has sectarianism; the decision is not positive; Guo is not allowed to appeal to the Central Committee; the Central Supervisory Commission is 'dragged and bureaucratic,' he said with nothing: 'Such examples are not individual within the Party.' Attacking the center cannot resolve the problem. \\n2, distorting the facts, he thinks that the Party Central Committee's handling of relevant cadres who made mistakes in their financial work in 1953 is unfair. He said: 'After comrades were criticized, they sat on a helicopter, □ □ □ □ were punished.' \\n3. The opposition party's democratic centralization system believes that the eight election methods are undemocratic. \\n(1), said: 'Nominating elected representatives is a manifestation of undemocracy. Last year \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), the Ministry of Finance named eight deputies is the central leadership comrades are undemocratic, not from unity...' and said that his opinion can be used for the Ninth Congress. \\n(2), Comrade in charge of the attack Central Committee, said: '□ □ Comrade in the general purchase and sale of food-can not avoid the dead-there is no difference, misery sense of thousands of miles.' \\n4, support right-wing speech, attack party leadership. \\n(1), said: 'The State Council pays so much to the prime minister, and there is no democratic person, it should increase the party's payment to the prime minister'. Praise the right-wing chapter is an instrument that 'has the money'. said: 'Lin Xiling is not a counter-revolution. According to our experience, the counter-revolution will not do this!' \\n(2), After looking at the attack by right-wing activist Zhang Zhen on Comrade He Long, he summed up the style of senior cadres and party organizations of my Party as 'flourishing, sectarianism'. He also used the Party's handling of Fu Ying to attack the grass-roots organizations of our Party. \\n5. Denying the correctness and achievements of the Party's leadership in agricultural socialist transformation, doubting the increase in grain production and the improvement of farmers' lives, and the Party can represent the interests of farmers. \\n(1), He said: 'After cooperation, the rural problem is serious: the overall purchase and sale has a role to play; cooperative ventures; large cadres of society are weak and unable to become home; workers and farmers have a huge difference in treatment, peasants are suffering from their lives, they are sick and despised to go to school'; 'There is a lot more from the peasants, and the general dissatisfaction of the rural people.' The countryside is not too peaceful, our dictatorship cannot be peaceful, if not vigilant, there may be bleeding. ...'\\n(2), He believes that the time has come for a national group of farmers to speak for farmers. \\n(3), He thinks that the number of increase in grain production in 1956 is not true, not even 10 billion pounds, he said: 'The figures that are casually reported below, the leadership has easily believed.' And to pursue responsibility for inaccurate figures. \\n(4), He said: 'Industrialization is faster and more on the budget.' \\nSecond, the attitude after the critical struggle:\\nIn the early days of the struggle, bad attitude, even a big temper, abusive comrades who gave him opinions; late in the struggle, said that he pleaded guilty. \\nIII.

				"memoirContent": "[Attached 2] Central Party School: 'Some materials on comrade Qi Peixuan's wrong thoughts and words and deeds 1957.10.24'\\n(Press: Comrade Chippexuan is the sixteenth branch of ordinary class trainee. During the bourgeois rampant attack, he complained for the corrupt, attempted to turn the case and carry out a slanderous attack against the party. During the anti-right struggle, he also found that he had written anonymous letters to the Central Committee last year for corruption issues against Hebei Provincial Committee and Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee. In addition, during the learning process, many erroneous remarks were made about agricultural cooperation, farmers' lives, the rural situation, the pace of industrialization and other important policy directions of the Party. (The school party committee and the leading group believe that the nature of these mistakes is serious, but Qi Peixuan not only refused to give up his own problems and ideas, but also reviewed and overturned it, so decided to publish the relevant materials to discuss criticism among all students.), \\nFirst, in the liberation of the case for the corrupt elements, write anonymous letters to the Central Committee, attack the party's stigmatization of the party\\nAfter listening to the embezzlement, Guo Xinguang (formerly the Secretary General of the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Government, Treasury Secretary and Director of Taxation, Qi's Party Introducer and Peasant Students), last year, said at a panel meeting on June 6 this year: 'Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee finalized the case of Guo Xinguang Not positive and unreasonable. Guo was a party member in 1931. In fact, there was no embezzlement and no distinction between public and private. After two years, the Party and administrative sanctions remained unchanged and reduced to level 24. Guo lodged a complaint to the Central Committee, but the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee was not allowed. Later, due to high blood pressure requirements to come to Beijing to cure the disease either. Before the Eighth National Congress, he went to Beijing to find the Central Supervisory Commission, because Comrade Liu Lantao was busy, looking for a director to talk to him. The director said, 'Your case is not corrupt, nor should it be disposed of,' and so on, but the Municipal Committee below has not yet been resolved. Guo asked for a thorough review and stay in the party, and the CCMC also delayed the resolution of Guo's issue. At the time of the review, the Commission still approved the decision to dispose of the same. On this issue, the Central Supervisory Commission is very bureaucratic.' He added: 'Such examples are not individual within the Party. The Central Committee cannot deal with the problem resolutely and decisively. This also shows that Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee has sectarianism.' \\nIn this anti-right struggle, in order to find out whether or not, comrades from the branch went to the Central Supervisory Commission and the Hebei Provincial Supervisory Commission to investigate the situation of Guo Xinguang's case. During the investigation, the investigation knew that during the process of handling Guo's complaint, he had received four anonymous letters to defend Guo Xinguang, and had been transferred to the Hebei Provincial Supervisory Commission. Later, we took these four anonymous letters from the Hebei Provincial Supervisory Commission. After the identification of the special bodies, the calligraphy laws, handwriting characteristics, paper, postmark, defense arguments, etc., were all determined to be written by Qi Peixuan. (Note: Qi also wrote an anonymous letter to Comrade Liu Xiufeng, not taken.), \\nThe contents of these 4 anonymous letters can mainly be boiled down to the following 5 points:\\n(1), slander attack Hebei Provincial Committee and Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee on the correctness of the three anti-movement leaders. (See the letter to the Chairman for details)\\n(2), the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee and Hebei Provincial Committee on Guo Xinguang's fight against the case of wanton attack. (See the letter to the Chairman and Comrade Shaoqi for details)\\n(3), falsely claiming Guo's case is 'wrong prison', Guo Xinguang reversed the case. (See letter to Comrade Shaoqi for details)\\n(4), the leading backbone of three anti-struggle against Hebei Province and Shijiazhuang. (See letter to Comrade Shaoqi for details)\\n(5), To slander Hebei Provincial Committee and Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee to restrict Guo's complaint to the Central Committee and deny Guo cure requests. (See the letter to Comrade Shaoqi and Ke Qingshi)\\n(6), to defend Guo Xinguang. (See 4 anonymous letters for details)\\nAccording to a letter from the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee on September 29 this year to this school, in addition to reflecting the real situation of Guo Xinguang's case, and denounces Qi Peixuan's question in the revelation of 'is not the truth, it is nothing, or even a false distortion'. The letter also revealed: 'Guo Xinguang sent him a gift, gave him 1 million yuan (old currency)', Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee letter said: 'It is not hard to see what the purpose of Qi Peixuan's zealous defense for Guo Xinguang's attack against the party.' \\n(For details of the anonymous letter and the details of Guo Xinguang's case, see annex)\\nIn this anti-right struggle, Chippexuan was inconceivable about writing anonymous letters and shy away from talking about it. In the course of the discussion of his issue, despite repeated indications and wanted him to give his own account, he replied very simply: 'I am totally opposed to this approach'. And said: 'The Party can be dealt with according to the Party discipline.' He also talked about Guo Xinguang, 'My opinion is still right.' And said, 'Guo is an old party member. It can't handle that way. The Central Commission has a dragging style and bureaucracy. It's right to fight negative tendencies as a party member.' When a comrade asked him, did you know the situation from the side? 'If you want a full survey to understand, then don't have to comment,' he said. He also said: 'I believe Guo Xinguang will not speak blind to me. If he says a blind talk, he will be responsible for himself.' \\nLater, the branch had to take out the original letter with him as a face card, and he had to admit, but only admitted that he had written one, did not account for a few others, and claimed that the letter was authorized by the party; the letter was not mistaken; the letter was not intended to be admitted. Later, the contents of the letter were read out publicly at the joint branch assembly, and he refused to review it. \\nSecond, arrogant, unorganized attack party leadership\\n(1), Qi's speech outline in the Ming Fang has one: 'Comrade Deng Xiaoping is not democratic, not from unity, and two accounts for party members: Durong (Ministry of Finance Rongzi and Vice Minister), and me; named eight representatives.' \\nOn 6 June, Qi made a statement on this opinion, saying: 'Comrade Deng Xiaoping's handling of the financial error in 1953 was unfair in handling Rongzi and deputy minister. According to the Ministry of Finance, Comrades Bo Bo and Wu Bo are in charge of tax work. Rong Zi and Comrade Rong made mistakes in tax policy. Although he was criticized, Wu also reviewed, but was punished by Rong Tou, which pressed two deputy ministers from the First Deputy Minister to the Third Deputy Minister, making people very much Unconvincing.' He added: 'Rong has been working in the Ministry of Finance after his founding. Of course, Rong has done a lot of work, mainly Rong has done a lot of work. On the contrary, after being criticized, comrade Bo sat in a helicopter, and Rong was punished. \\nAt the same panel meeting, Qi also said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping said at a meeting of the Ministry of Finance: Do not think that you are always doing financial work, you will not be able to leave you. Qi thinks that 'it is inappropriate to criticize in such a tone on such occasions'. 'Hit a lot of people, the impact is bad.' In addition, he said that Deng's account against him was like this: at a summary of the work of the Ministry of Finance, the director of the Department of Finance or more cadres went to him for a meeting, Qi presented his opinion, saying that Deng Lai Finance Ministry should meet, lest everyone go to him and run there. Later, Deng explained at a meeting of the Ministry of Finance. Qi thinks it is a criticism and dissatisfaction with himself. \\nThe above two things are the so-called 'two accounts of Deng against party members' in his speech outline. The other one is:\\nConsiders that the election method of the eight delegates is undemocratic\\nIn his statement at the panel's opening session on 5 June, Qi also disagreed with the introduction of nominal elections in central State organs (the fact is that the central government will submit a list of candidates for representation first and then put forward after discussion at various levels of organization). He said: 'Candidates who went down to the provincial elections, because they were not aware of their situation in the province, can use the nomination method, but those elected in the central organs do not necessarily have to be named. Can't we choose a good representative yet?' He believed that naming was a manifestation of undemocracy. It is understood: 'We agree that the four comrades are candidates (Li Xiannian, Jin Ming, Wu Bo, Li Yuang),' said at the meeting on May 15, when the party group of the Ministry of Finance held an expanded meeting to brew the list of eight delegates. But he went on to say: 'There is too little understanding of the situation of the four comrades, nor about the basis for the representation, and to make no comments.' In fact, he was not so unaware of the four candidates, but reflected his dissatisfaction. Because at the second meeting, he also made a lot of comments about the comrades. In a small conversation with the group this year, he added: 'When discussing the list of candidates, the cadre made a lot of opinions about a comrade. A comrade was still present. This approach is the person chosen as a representative, and the thought is carrying a burden.' In fact, he had made a number of comments on several representatives at that time, some of which were very wrong. \\n(2), Qi also wrote in the sounding outline is: 'Comrade Chen Yun in the general purchase of food-can not avoid the dead-the difference, the sense of misery of thousands of miles.' (In terms of meaning, he had an opinion on Comrade Chen Yun's words, which was mentioned to individual comrades at that time, but did not emit at the group meeting)\\n(3), After the branch has conveyed the question of not extending the study time, Qi also advocated further proposals for extension, the former deputy letter explained: the school party committee has asked the Central Committee, the Central Committee has decided not to extend; and the school has already conveyed, we again ask for an extension is unnecessary. Qi was very unhappy, immediately scolded: '□ □ □, tear chicken eggs, what power he has to decide on this issue, that is, the central government decides, can also give opinions.' \\nThird, sympathy and support for certain right-wing statements\\n(1), On May 15 this year, when discussing the issue of the current situation linked to the work of democratic personalities, Qi said: 'There are so many vice-premiers of the State Council, without a democracy, should be added to the party vice-premier.' Other comrades disagreed, and he said, 'Do not believe, look in the future!' \\n(2), a comrade saw Zhang Naiji's speech at the United Front Department symposium in the newspaper, aligned: Look, Zhang Naiji said that they have the right to have the right to fight. Qi replied, 'It is the fight. This guy is one of the seven gentlemen and has the money.' \\n(3), After Lin Xiling delivered a reactionary speech at Peking University, Qi once said to a comrade: 'Lin Xiling is not a counter-revolution. According to our experience, the counter-revolution will not do so!' \\n(4), On May 29 this year, the group will talk about society, Qi said: 'I looked at the recent material, made some excerpts of comments, divided into a class.' Then, under the heading summarized as 'flourishing, sectarianism', the following miscomments were made:\\nHe said: When looking at Zhang Zhen's opinion on He Long in the 'internal reference', he thinks that Comrade He Long's treatment of democratic personalities should not be the same temper and excessively criticized, this will affect the unity with people outside the party. Also in the outline of his speech, he also wrote: 'From Zhang Zhen's views on He Long, Rong Gaotang and Cai Shu Fan, we see the style of our senior cadres.' \\nWe believe that the handling of Fu Ying and his family in the fight against him is inappropriate. 'From the attitude towards Fu Ying and her sons, we see the policy of our lower party towards foreign students,' he wrote in the outline of his speech. \\nAfter looking at Qian Xuesen's four recommendations (see the seventh edition of the People's Daily on May 28, 'Why the new learning has been ignored'), he wrote in his speech syllabus: 'Testimonials about Qian Xuesen's four proposals, why the 12-year scientific planning is not with others.' \\n(5), after making the above comments, Qi went on to say: 'The farmers have not yet spoken'. \\n4. Thinking that agricultural cooperation risked, doubts and dissatisfaction with certain important policies of the Party in rural areas\\n(1), think that cooperation risked into; peasants live bitter; rural is not too peaceful\\n'The situation in the countryside (some of them), deserves serious attention, which tells us that our dictatorship cannot be peaceful and should be vigilant,' Qi peixuan wrote in the outline note of his statement on 3 January 1957. \\nHe thinks that the reason for not being peaceful is: 'The introduction of cooperation, that is, the social college and cadres are not commensurate with the ability of cadres, and now cannot be such everyone; plus the style of subjectivity, disaster situation, the disparity in treatment of workers and farmers (not suffering from poverty and unequal treatment), the impact of the Hungarian events, political education (especially in school education), is weak.' \\nIn his view, the solution was: 'The basic approach is to help farmers produce, taking into account the appropriate slowdown of industrialization, thereby increasing the production of necessities and reducing some exports, etc. Taishiwa small society (not generally doing this), is combined with streamlining, decentralizing strong cadres to prefectural and district levels (this is the main method), the wages of employees have been slowed down a little, and political education at lower level cadres and schools is strengthened. \\nAt a seminar, Qi said: 'China's proletarian dictatorship is currently mainly a problem of improving the lives of farmers.' At the panel meeting on January 3, he added: 'At present, the social college, the cadres are weak, and the strength is not enough to be the family; the senior society rises into it.' When the deputy leader asked him 'whether farmers' lives have improved,' Qi said: 'Poor farmers' lives have improved.' \\nAccording to a note from the deputy team leader at the time, Qi said: 'At present, there are some serious problems among the peasants, there are some serious problems, there are reactions from the peasants, students have reflected, and the problem of demobilized soldiers is more serious. Our dictatorship cannot be peaceful, if not vigilant, there is a possibility of bleeding, may turn into a confrontational struggle.' \\nFor this reason, Qi also proposed to make recommendations to the Central Committee. At that time, other comrades thought that the Central Committee had already attracted attention, it was not necessary. Qi still insisted that the reaction was good, it could lead the Central Committee to pay more attention. \\nOn 5 June this year, when the panel came out, Qi added: 'The problem of accumulation and consumption, that is, in distributing consumption, attention should be paid to the problem of farmers. China's economic life depends mainly on agriculture. In terms of net output value, agriculture accounts for two thirds, and from gross production, the value of industrial and agricultural produce accounts for half, in turn, farmers suffer.' \\n'The problems of rural areas require special attention and do not consider it to be peaceful.' \\n'The life of workers and farmers is a matter of distribution. I have different views with comrades of little odd. Whether farmers live more bitter than workers, this reality should be acknowledged.' \\nIn another group meeting, Qi introduced the situation of peasants after cooperation, said: 'My sister's family only distributed two and a half dollars a year. I was sick and despised. Students would spend more than 100 yuan a year in school, so I couldn't afford to go to school.' \\nFollowing a panel briefing on June 6, a comrade spoke that 60-70 per cent of poor farmers and lower middle farmers in rural areas have improved their lives, together said: 'Now the rural situation has changed, life cannot be seen from class, the labor force lives well and the labor force is bad.' \\n(2), think that the overall purchase and sales policy has side effects, more from farmers\\nOn 24 November 1956, when discussing the report of Comrade Shauqi and Prime Minister Zhou, the Panel said, 'It depends on who the problem is greater, mainly farmers, and of course workers.' Then it went on to say that 'the overall purchase and sale has side effects. Farmers sell the base, buy expensive. Although the agricultural tax is counterbalanced with spending, it cannot be seen from this aspect alone.' \\nOn June 6 this year, at the panel, a comrade spoke about the advantages of cooperation, while not neglecting the shortcomings in production management and financial management, Qi immediately refuted: 'You don't know my opinion at all.' And said: 'There is also a problem in the acquisition, accumulate more in the national budget, industrialization faster, take more from farmers, such as price difference, purchase food...' \\n(iii), Number of suspected increases in grain production in 1956\\nOn November 24, 1956, when the group discussed the report of Comrade Shaoqi and Prime Minister Zhou, expressed doubts about the 20 billion kg increase in grain production in 1956. In his report to the Supreme State Council in February 1957, Chairman Mao also mentioned the increase in grain production last year by 20 billion pounds. Qi worries the Chairman to speak out, how to finish. \\nOn June 5 this year, when the group came out, Qi remained sceptical about Comrade Deng Zihui's report of an increase of 16 billion pounds or more than 15 billion pounds in grain production. He said: 'The problem of increasing grain production, the numbers are reported casually below. The figures are determined by typical surveys, estimates, and decisions by the head of the board. This is of course because of our poor base and bad statistics. But on this issue, we are bureaucratic. This problem has a lot of impact. This number has a lot to do with determining the country's policy, policy, general purchase and sale, construction speed, etc. Below reported 20 billion pounds, the leadership is also easy to believe, a little attention, you can suspect this number. The large account can be calculated, such as according to the disaster, land clearing, the conversion of dry fields to paddy fields, and technical measures, and so on, decide the proportion of production increase. In general, there should be a close to actual figure in the agricultural sector. Last year, the disaster was relatively large, due to the disaster production reduction of 20 billion kilograms, plus an increase of 20 billion pounds, that is 40 billion pounds, taking 350 billion pounds in 1955 to 40 billion pounds, an increase of more than 11%. China has never seen such a situation in history. In the past, a 5% increase in Soviet output was minimal. Now say 15 billion pounds, I think 10 billion pounds will not reach. This figure is one of the basic figures for decision-making on national livelihoods and is also one of the main figures, and it is important to examine who is responsible in this matter. The larger issue of responsibility should be clarified to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future. When the center is wrong, the next wrong will be bigger. Poor, myriad thousands of miles.' \\nHe also argued that the issue of fiscal overruns of $3 billion in 1956 should be pursued with accountability and lessons learned. \\n(4), think there is a need for a national group of farmers to speak for farmers\\nThis spring, one day after lunch, while talking with his home-house comrades, Qi said, 'Why don't there be a national group of farmers? There are groups of workers, young people and women. There is a peasant group that speaks for farmers. At the Ministry of Finance, he also asked others why there were no peasant groups right now. \\nV. Repeated confrontation movements in the fight against the right\\n(1), When the meeting of the branch to discuss the nature of anti-right struggle ended, at the joint meeting of the branch group (Qi is a member of the branch), a group leader had reflected that the group comrades thought that Qi's speech had right-leaning thoughts. At the end of the meeting, Qi felt that the comrades who reflected opinions were very naive and said that his speech at the branch assembly could not represent his thoughts. Then he boasted that in the past he had been 'always left', 'principled', 'strong political', and he was a backbone in the various movements of the Ministry of Finance, and he was very naive, and asked the branch secretary to immediately express his attitude and draw conclusions to him. \\n(2), After the meeting, the secretary of the branch came up with an individual conversation. When it comes to the issue of the branch's guiding ideas for the meeting, he argued that the branch assembly was only discussing the issue, distinguishing between the right and not, it was considered right leaning; at the seminar, it should not be criticized and inspected. Thoughts. He added: he criticized his comrades who had right-leaning thoughts were very naive, or very polite, 'actually a quality problem, speculation in sports.' He also made it clear that whoever wants to say that his speech has right-leaning thoughts, he will never agree: 'Even if the School Party Committee and the Central Committee make a conclusion, I reserve it.' \\nThe book immediately disagreed with him. And he said, If I had known such guidance as you, I would not speak again, lest this '250 be recorded. ' Didy says: Dissenting opinions can be debated at the meeting. Qi said: 'Everyone is officials, you have experience as officials, I also have experience as officials. Now we are all learners, and there is anything to discuss. I don't know what guiding thought is your book. If I know your intentions, I'm going to speak from the left side, insurance is more than they left, insurance makes you happy.' \\n(3), The sixteenth branch alignment criticism began in mid-July, and it has now been three months. From his overall attitude, it is not honest, the most obvious is capricious, today said that tomorrow can be overturned. During this time, there has been some progress, but there has been little talk about one's specific ideological activities, and resistance occurs. If, on 19 July, the Panel stated that his self-review findings were not consistent with the facts he had exposed, and asked him to expose his ideas further, he asked, in turn, 'Do you want me to raise the facts to meet the conclusions?' After the group, the support committee for individual talks and many help, in the afternoon of August 8, criticized his attitude and made a more specific examination; Wait the next day again overturned the previous day's statements, saying that his examination was 'rather high not low', 'afraid comrades will not allow customs clearance.' In the course of his criticism, he was opposed to linking the issue. When his analytical criticism of comrades was unjustifiable, he said that sympathy for the right was not his true thought, and said to comrades, 'I know that you (referring to the comrades who made opinions), are really good, I'm afraid of you! Where do I have that high level!' \\nWhen his attitude was criticized, he did not take a positive look at the questions of principle raised by his comrades, on the other hand. And as he said, Anyway I have a bottom in my heart, and I will not argue that you criticize you. When this technique was debunked, he then turned to the method of dragging, delaying time and trying to end, returning to the original organ. In an individual conversation with the head of the team on 8 August, he said: 'I made another mistake in estimating the time.' \\nSubsequently, his mistakes were further exposed and criticized by the branches and groups, and he had to conduct a review at a branch assembly on 5 September, after which comrades gave him a lot of comments. He did not see this, and he tried to overthrow the main part of the inspection. When the team leader gave him a copy of his review shorthand on September 20, he said: 'Look at what this is useful, the nature of my question needs to be reconsidered, and I have different opinions.' \\nIn an individual interview with the head of the team on 26 September, the Panel Leader asked: since there were so many different views, why should it be reviewed like that? Qi said: 'Thought problems, just improve some!' He also said: 'If the party committee and comrades think I am fundamentally wrong, I have no opinion, but I don't have a sense of mind.' 'I am mentally prepared to be the right, start from scratch, work well, wait for the fair conclusion of the organization.' \\n(4), On October 4, after the branch branch introduced Qi Peixuan's wrong words and deeds at the joint branch meeting according to the plan of the school party committee, the comrades who abused the materials provided by the Ministry of Finance were 'framed by plane.' When he pointed out that his attitude was extremely wrong, he also said: 'Not only curse, if he is present, I will fight it!' \\nOn the evening of October 8, Qi said to the secretary of the branch that he had shortcomings, but he himself did not think it was serious. The team leader criticized him as 'worthless money', 'I simply despised him'; and cursed the comrades who provided the materials from the Ministry of Finance were 'framed by air'; and asked Guo Xinguang, a director of the Central Commission and Shijiazhuang municipal party party confrontation, do not figure out 'death is not convinced'. \\nOn October 9, Qi refused to review at the group meeting. When a comrade criticized him for taking such a confrontational attitude at the party meeting for not enough party member conditions, he said fierce: 'Not enough to dismiss it!' \\nOn October 10, Qi said at the branch assembly that 'their mistakes are not serious, do not agree with the reference to the joint branch meeting to resolve', and that 'the criticism of the Central Monitoring Commission and Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee should be reviewed, and can not be said to be my own mistakes'. That night, he said to comrade the group: 'Rather than die under the knife, not in words', he expressed his determination to reject criticism. \\nOn the morning of October 11, he said at the group meeting: 'All he has to say, do not delay the time, get criticism at the Joint Branch Assembly or the whole school conference!' \\nNote: Qi Peixuan, 46 years old, Pingshan County, Hebei province, family origin farmers, personal composition primary school teachers. 1937, joined the party in 1938, former Director of Defence Finance Department, Ministry of Finance, Level 9.

				"memoirContent": "【Attachment 3】The 16th branch of ordinary class: 'Summary of the winds and anti-right movements'\\nFirst, the basic situation\\nStage 1: Ideological Initiation (early June to mid-July)\\nSince early June, according to the instructions of the Central Committee and the arrangements of the School Party Committee, I learned the instructions of the Central Committee on the rectification movement and Chairman Mao's report on 'Correct handling of internal contradictions among the people', and carried out a great magnification, and initially revealed their thoughts; on June 20, the school party committee conveyed the CPC's views on the trainees After the instructions to stay in school, the branch developed according to the thought situation at the time. The study plan also mobilized all comrades to propose individual learning plans and discussed the reference materials published by the school department, especially on the nature, strategy and methods of anti-right struggles. \\nThe second stage: anti-right thinking (mid-July to the end of July). \\nAfter listening to President Yang's directive on July 11, Deng Xiaoping's directive on the winds and Vice President Hou's report on July 12, the branch organized comrades criticized and self-criticised the problems and different degrees of right-leaning thoughts that were revealed in the previous period of study. In this phase, with the exception of a handful of more serious right-leaning comrades who have not yet truly recognized their mistakes and individual comrades have not been properly criticized, the vast majority of comrades have gained further awareness and criticism of right-leaning mistakes (when right-wing Zipexuan's wrong words and deeds), Not yet fully exposed). \\nThird stage: anti-right struggle (early August to late October)\\nWith the anti-right movement across the school, Qi peixuan's miswords and deeds have gradually come to light. It turns out that he has fallen to the right in the party by a Communist member with a serious bourgeoisie individualist ideology. Under the new struggle mission, the branch has deployed the fighting forces: in addition to the few comrades in individual groups who continue to critically help comrades who have committed serious right-leaning ideological mistakes and individual misdemeanors, they have invested most of the forces into the fight against the right, Zipexuan; in addition to organizing the mobilization of the right. Study groups, alignment of historical situations, consistent performance in personal and party relationships and rural areas related to their mistakes The situation, all carried out serious investigation and research, more fully achieved 'setting the facts and reasoning'. After reasoning and criticism, Qi had to plead guilty to the party. \\nStage 4: Summary work (mid-10 to late November)\\nAt this stage, according to the instructions of the School Party Committee, all the comrades conducted repeated discussions and arguments on the nature of the 'main school focus', according to the Central Committee's criteria for the division of right-wing elements, and carefully summed up their own experience and experience in the movement; the committee drafted the politics of right-wing elements Conclusions, serious right thinking wrong comrades thought conclusions, and branch work summary , collated the archived materials, and made written proposals to the party committee concerned about individual comrades and wrongdoing mistakes. In this paragraph, we also learned several classics related to the current movement, and were educated once again at the end of the winds. \\nII. Harvest\\nThis rectifying and anti-right movement has been one of the deepest and richest political ideological education and a exercise and test of the most vivid and effective class struggle. \\nIn this campaign, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the School Party Committee, we carried out a great magnification within the party, expose and fight against a party right, criticized four comrades for serious right-leaning thinking mistakes, initially criticizing a comrade's serious lawlessness and discipline mistakes, and also criticized the more widespread existence of a comrade. The general right-leaning thought and the bourgeois individualist thought that enhances all comrades The level of political thought has strengthened confidence in the cause of the socialist revolution, purified the party's ranks and strengthened the party's combat power. \\nBefore entering the whole wind and anti-right movements, the minds of the vast majority of comrades in the branch were healthy, strongly supported the leadership of the Party Central Committee, and the revolutionary stance was firm. When the bourgeoisie right rampant attack on the party, while everyone showed different degrees of right-leaning sentiment more generally, after investing in the whole wind study, the vast majority were able to quickly criticize and self-criticism, overcome misconceptions and actively engage in anti-right struggle. A few comrades who have committed serious right-wing thinking mistakes, through the help of the party and comrades, can basically understand the seriousness of their mistakes, correct their positions and conduct different degrees of self-examination. Individual comrades who have committed serious violations of law and discipline, after education and criticism, have also made a preliminary understanding of the seriousness of the error and expressed their willingness to repent. Chippesian, who has fallen to the right in the party, has also had to plead guilty to the party after our serious debriefing, criticism and resolute struggle against him. \\nThanks to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the conscious efforts of all comrades, the development of the movement is healthy, the harvest is enormous and rich. \\nAs a result of this campaign, what are the fundamental issues we have received the most visible and profound education? \\nThe first is to have a deep and clear understanding of the new situation and content of class struggles at this stage. Recognizing that the fundamental change of ownership of the means of production, the basic end of a massive class struggle does not mean that the socialist revolution has been completed, nor the complete end of class struggles, and that we must carry the socialist revolution to the end on the political and ideological fronts, a deeper and more Extensive class struggles. Although the right of the bourgeois and bourgeois intellectuals have entered socialism in the climax of the revolution, but they are not convinced. They still have a certain influence in the political and intellectual fields, and when there is the right time, they will compete with us. It is not accidental that they launched a rampant attack against the party this time through the party's policy of enlarging policy and winding movement. Many senior cadres in our party school students have not estimated enough class struggles under the new situation and lost their political vigilance. Some comrades believe that right-wing rhetoric has a part of the truth and deserves a reference study; some comrades smell wrong, but they have not yet understood the bourgeois right revival plot. A few comrades, because of the bourgeoisie ideology, have vague or even misperceptions on some of the fundamental issues of the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Chippesian is also taking advantage of this opportunity to carry out attacks and slander against the party together with the right in society. After this exercise of bristling and anti-right struggles, we realize that all party members, especially senior party cadres, need to maintain a strong class position at all times, maintain a strong class feelings and a sober political mind. To do this, we must strive to raise their own level of political thinking. Thoroughly remove the residual effects of a variety of bourgeois. \\nSecondly, Chairman Mao taught us in his report 'How to properly deal with the internal contradictions of the people' that the political criteria to identify whether people speak correctly, mainly by looking at his attitude towards the leadership of the Party and the socialist path. We also have a profound understanding of this standard through both winds and anti-right movements, increasing political vigilance and discernibility. This time, the right and intra-party right in society used all sorts of vicious tactics to deny the country's great socialist revolution and achievements of construction in the past few years, trying to change the socialist path. They attacked the Party more frantically and attacked the Central Committee in an attempt to weaken or even overthrow the party's leadership. Recall that in the early days of social revelation, since we did not fully understand how to distinguish between internal contradictions among the people and those against me, we could not identify fragrant flowers and poison grass from the main political criteria, some comrades have generated varying degrees of sympathy and resonance towards right-wing speech; even in the fight against the right., some people have also shown sympathy, doubting whether the statements of the right in the party are attacking the party towards socialism. As a result, some are soft and unable to reach their hands, a few comrades who have committed serious right-wing misconceptions, suspect that the party has misarranged for the democrats, leaving them without authority; doubts whether the work of 1956 rises; doubts whether the leadership of the Party Central Party is swung around; doubts whether the party's power is too large and there is a 'party generation of government' even when Lin Xiling attacked the party, he said that it was not enough education for her; and The right-wing elements of the rebel party who committed suicide also expressed regret, among others. After the practice of anti-right struggle, the criminal words and deeds of anti-socialism of the right-wing opposition party in the party were thoroughly exposed and criticized, only the eyes were polished and awareness raised. All of our comrades are keenly aware that only by firmly trusting and consciously upholding the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and steadfastly defending the path of socialism can we not lose our direction in a sharp class struggle. \\nThird, through this struggle, there has been a more concrete and cordial understanding of the principles of Marxist Leninism's theory of class struggle and proletarian dictatorship and the fundamental distinction between proletarian democracy and bourgeois democracy. The right in society cries that we are 'party world', 'party generation government,' and called for the establishment of a 'political design institute', and so on. It is essentially an attempt to replace the dictatorship of the proletarian class with bourgeoisie dictatorship and take the path of capitalism. Our position on this issue should be firm and unequivocal, and there must be no slightest ambiguity or shaken. While we have conceptually understood this issue in the past, these theoretical weapons are often not used well in the early days of the movement when confronted with actual political struggles. Not only did the right, Qi Peixuan, put forward the need to increase the party vice-premier, and agreed that Zhang is 'entitled to power is the struggle' and other reactionary remarks; some comrades have also said that 'there is no scary for the right's cry', doubting that 'our working methods of party organizations in the government system have shortcomings', in this The problem shows a serious right leaning, and our criticism and counterattack against these misstatements are not possible in the first place. It is only as the movement progresses that awareness of the principles of the nature of the State regime is raised gradually by all of us. In particular, having studied several classics, we are even more convinced that the main task in the current political struggle can only be to continue to consolidate and strengthen the leadership of the party, to continue to consolidate and strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, and not weaken in any way; we recognize that the great revolutionary mentors were 100 years ago The doctrine of proletarian dictatorship, which has been summed up in theory, has suffered again today in the actual struggle of China The test, played incomparable power. \\nFourth, a deep critical and systematic examination of the various and varying degrees of bourgeois individualism has drawn the boundaries between the proletarian and bourgeois, and strengthens the party's ideological position. Before the winds movement, the situation in the party was indeed, as Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his 'report on the rectification movement': 'Some members of the Party have serious bourgeoisie individualism, pursuing personal enjoyment and are more honorary. There are also very few party members who have lost their will to revolutionize and even become corrupt and illegal.' When we examine right-leaning thoughts and summarizing ideas, we more generally expose and examine bourgeois individualistic ideas of varying degrees. The result of the development of these ideas, manifested in the life of the Party, is necessarily a measure of personal gain or loss and dissatisfaction with the party; in politics, people with serious individualist ideas are necessarily class boundaries, political sense is not bad, can not withstand risks and can not stand the test; in actual struggles, they often appear. Now warm, weak. When the anti-party rhetoric of the right in society is reflected in the party, comrades who measure higher levels of treatment can easily generate sympathy and resonance on cadre policy issues. What say 'leaders wear small shoes', 'invisible blows the most terrible'. 'People who are close to leaders are more likely to be promoted quickly, and they can say they will write. Open, people who give opinions often suffer and touch nails'; those with extreme democratic tendencies suspect that the leadership of the party is not democratic; Pride and complacency; arrogant and ignorant people often lack the trust they deserve in the leadership of the Party, doubt whether the central government is wrong in handling certain issues, saying that everything can not be correct, or even mistakenly think that the central government swings around and is contradictory; people with one-sided peasant views suspect agricultural cooperation Whether the pace of development has been fast, whether the standards for farmers' food retention are too low; they have borne a burden in the three anti-counter, countermeasures and other movements Or people who do not completely solve the problem in these movements, they doubt whether the movements have 'left' phenomenon, doubts whether certain provisions of the Central Committee in the movement have side effects; some comrades have also shown insufficient confidence in the rectification movement, believing that the whole wind 'can only cure the symptoms, cannot cure the cause', doubting whether this time can be done and so on. These erroneous facts, after all, are the bourgeoisie thinking from it. The vivid fact that right-wing Tsipheen has evolved from serious bourgeoisie individualism to anti-socialist anti-socialism has helped us to learn useful lessons from it. As some comrades examine their misconceptions, wrote, 'Individualism is the source of all evil'; another comrade wrote: 'Look at them (right in the party), contact yourself and surprise.' In addition, it should also be pointed out that individual comrades have repeatedly made serious mistakes in relations between men and women because they have been severely corroded by the bourgeois thinking, they have repeatedly made serious mistakes in relations between men and women, and they do not hesitate to 'lose their name', and have seriously lost the revolutionary qualities of the Communist Party members. This campaign also knocked a warning bell on him. \\nThrough this campaign, we truly realize that all kinds of individualistic ideas, in the final analysis, are the ideological reflection of the private ownership of the means of production. Therefore, the issue of ideological views is inseparable from the struggle between the two paths of politics. Only highly conscious people can have political. True consciousness. Chairman Mao told us: 'Communist Party members must be vigorous, must have a strong revolutionary will, there must be a spirit of not fear of difficulties and use perseverance to overcome any difficulties, and must overcome individualism, uniformity, absolute egalitanism and liberalism, otherwise it is not a 'A veritable Communist Party member'. Through this education of the whole wind and anti-right struggle, we have learned more concrete and cordial with the wise instructions of Chairman Mao. \\nIn addition to the above ideological understanding gains, our branch revealed in the movement the right party, Qi Peixuan, pure the party's team, and strengthened the party's combat power. We have learned during the movement that the anti-right struggle in our school is characterized by the fact that the branch members are senior cadres, the level of political thought is relatively high, the experience of the struggle is rich and has no work burden. This is an extremely favorable condition for conducting anti-right struggles; however, those who commit political mistakes also have political capital. With more experience in fighting within the Party, their misthinking and words and deeds are also more systematic and stubborn. In the past, the right-wing, Qi Peixuan, believed that it was politically strong and had always been valued by the Party. It was deeply entrenched bourgeoisie individualism, arrogant arrogant and unorganized. In politics, he tried to change the party's policy with his own ideas, and carried out a slander attack on the party's organization and senior party cadres. This is the same as the party and the whole We can not tolerate. After three months of struggle, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the efforts of all comrades and the support of the brothers branch, he was forced to bow to the party to confess guilt through deep exposure to criticism. According to the Central Committee's criteria for the division of the right, after discussion, we determined that Qi Peixuan is the right in the party. In addition, we read other school-wide focused materials, participated in the critical struggle against them, and debated their erroneous nature. This is another life memorable class education for all of us, and the most specific theories linked to actual education. One of the deepest education that the struggle has given us is that we are deeply aware that it is no coincidence that senior cadres fall into the right in the party. As pointed out in the People's Daily editorial, there will be a group of party members in successive revolutionary struggles to betray the party because the interests of individuals and class clashes with those of the revolution. That's what they have in common. Knowing this adds to our vigilance to the individualistic thinking of the bourgeois. \\nIII. Lessons learned\\nThe lessons learned from the past six months of good breath and anti-right struggle have been very rich. The main lessons can be summarized as follows:\\nFirst of all, under the correct leadership of the school party committee, the branch will firmly carry out the central policy and instructions, which is the basic key to victory. At the beginning of the campaign, our perception of the current stage of class struggles was unclear, if not wrong; the struggle over the current two paths on the political front and on the ideological front was inadequate or even rather blind. In the revelation, we have more generally exposed right-leaning thoughts, and many are serious. We are not clear in mind: the mandate and nature of the revolution have changed, the criteria for identifying revolutions and counter-revolutions are different. As a result, the boundaries of the enemy are blurred, their views are blurred, their positions are shaken and manifested in varying degrees of sympathy in the fight against the right. Having carefully studied the documents, instructions and related editorials of the Central Committee on the fight against the wind and anti-right, and thanks to the direct instructions of the Central Committee and the specific leadership of the school party committee and the leadership group, we have gradually increased our awareness of the movement, overcoming the right-leaning ideology and feelings of affectionism, so that the movement will be carried out in a healthy manner, The implementation of the central policy and strategy spirit has achieved the desired results and has achieved significant gains. At the same time, the work of the JSC also played a collective leadership role: division of labour, in-depth groups, timely identification of problems, research and resolution, timely requests for reports were made; through joint meetings of branch groups to study the situation, arrange work and exert collective wisdom. This ensures the implementation of the central wind instructions and the healthy development of sports. Therefore, no matter how viciously the right elements inside and outside the party or outside the party are opposed to the Party or against the Central Committee, the first condition for our victory in the movement remains the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and its superior party committee; the achievements of our movement have once again proved the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee. \\nSecond, firm trust in the masses and the full use of the masses is an important guarantee of victory. When the Central Committee and the School Party Committee decided to stay in school, that is, they pointed out that they believe that senior cadres themselves have the power to solve their internal problems. In communicating Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instructions on winding and anti-right struggles, we must firmly trust the majority of the masses and make full use of the masses. Lines to resolve contradictions. Under the direct leadership of the school party committee and the leadership group, the branch has been tightly grasped this spirit of guidance. At the beginning of the winds movement, it was carried out within the group; after visiting the big print of Peking University and Tsinghua, talks were consciously organized; criticized the eight categories of issues in the school-published reference materials for the study of winds and right-leaning thoughts reflected within the branch, and seriously criticized the anti-right struggle The nature, policies, methods and other issues were debated at the branch assembly. Through these work, ideological mobilization has been carried out more fully, raising the awareness of the masses. In the fight against the right, the allocation of power and the division of tasks have been properly arranged, and the people's enthusiasm has been more fully exploited; it is also better to cooperate in ideological criticism and research work, thus making more full use of the collective wisdom of the masses and the struggle for reason. One lesson that should also be recognized in this regard is the initiation of individual plans at the anti-right thinking stage, which allows everyone to clarify the purpose and requirements for criticizing and self-criticism, so that it is easy to relate to his or her own ideological reality and to prevent the emergence of 'good luck' and 'just the truth, without combining ideas' 'want to be practical' bias. Facts prove that whenever the individual plan is realistic, the solution of the intellectual problem is relatively deep and transparent. As the movement progresses, the individual plan is constantly supplemented and developed, and the final summary of personal thoughts is carried out on the basis of this plan. It should be said that this is also a concrete way of working to solve the problem by the masses themselves. \\nThirdly, timely criticism and overcoming sympathy is an important part of the movement to advance and win the fight against the right. The struggle against the right is a struggle that determines the destiny of our country and a struggle that relates to the life and death of the socialist cause. The reactionaries cannot be allowed to have the slightest feelings and pity. This is true for the right in society, and for the right within the party. Particularly treat the right-wing elements of senior cadres within the Party, because they all have a long history of party age and struggle, they have done some work for the party, which is most likely to be soft to them. Our branch comrades, including the leadership of the branch committee, showed different degrees of sympathy in the early days of the movement: some comrades thought that the right in the party should be treated differently from the right in society; some comrades had looked at Wang Tan's misleading factual material and thought that his mistakes were a matter of intra-party thinking; in criticism. After the first group of school priorities, we also had insufficient understanding of Xiaolu's reactionary words and deeds. After repeated research, only from Essentially, his erroneous nature is the political problem of anti-socialism; after learning the analysis and instructions of the Central Secretariat on this issue, awareness has improved, but ideological warmth has not been overcome completely, and when discussing Zhao's wrong nature, some Comrades still cannot afford to classify him as the right. In aligning the nature of Paihin's mistakes, the beginning is also a lack of awareness. Although the false fact of Qi is gradually revealed in the course of the struggle, it is impossible to clarify the nature of the problem at the beginning of the struggle, but it is undeniable that we also have a certain degree of hesitation and fear of struggle in the course of the struggle. By the end of the movement, the Central Committee has made it clear that in the anti-right struggle, both temperament and impatience must be overcome, at this time the sympathism of some of the comrades in the branch also revealed. In discussing the nature of the problems that the school focuses, there have been a lot of biased opinions. Aligning Paixuan's cunning and recalcitrant, a few comrades have also developed a degree of impatience. Because the Central Committee has repeatedly pointed out to us the need to overcome sympathism in time and again, and because under the direct leadership of the school party committee, many large university debates have been held, the warmth that exists in my branch comrades continues to be criticized and overcome, ensuring the healthy development of the movement. \\nFourthly, distinguishing between the nature of the wrong problem, paying attention to changing circumstances and changing methods of struggle in a timely manner is another important factor in making the campaign run smoothly. Under the correct leadership of the school party committee and the leadership team, we first treat the wrong facts with a realistic attitude, neither exaggerated nor narrowed, carefully studied, combined with necessary and possible survey evidence, and then measure it from other key materials across the school, and then according to the different nature of the problem Identify different methods of struggle, so as to ensure good and not leakage. The second is to focus on 'putting facts, reasoning', not rush to wear a hat, can reduce the phenomenon of cows, but also prevent irritability, but also facilitate the progressive depth of thought criticism. Once again, the movement is facilitated by the flexible use of different methods of struggle based on the attitude of the wrongdoers to the wrong, reducing or reversing the antagonistic mood in a timely manner. In our fight against Peihin, we used to criticize individual conversations, group meetings, critical struggles at the branch assembly, etc.; when we have taken recalcitrant attitude, that is, in accordance with the direction of the leadership group, the material is presented at the JUNJU, ready to criticize at the same assembly; but when he says Willing to review the guilty plea at the branch assembly, and then promptly ask and with the consent of the leadership, instead of criticizing at the branch assembly, Representatives of the branches of the JUNPF were also invited to participate, which would be more conducive to making Qi bow to the party to confess guilt. Comrades who have committed serious right-leaning mistakes have also been criticized or self-examined at the branch assembly or group meeting, depending on their degree of error, perception of the wrong, and their attitude to review mistakes. In this way, comrades who make mistakes in education receive better results. \\nFifth, adhering to the method of struggle 'to put the truth and make sense' is both the best way to connect theory with reality, raise awareness and transform ideas, as well as the most effective way to combat them. Any change in thinking, from understanding mistakes to correcting mistakes, must go through a certain process. Promoting a change in awareness is by no means a simple, impatient approach. From our struggle practice, it has proved that, whether critical and political mistakes, two important links must be mastered, namely, to have precise facts and full justification in order to be truly effective. This is the main experience that we educate to help several comrades who have committed serious right-leaning misconceptions; so is the key experience of criticizing Chippehin many times. He would not plead guilty to the party if we did not grasp conclusive information about Zipexuan's anti-party crimes through investigation and research, not to organize systematic and comprehensive criticism and carry out in-depth thematic criticism, with reasonable grounds, and put his ugly face completely debunked. Some comrades have experienced a lack of convincing in critical struggles due to a lack of emphasis on theoretical learning in the past. He himself wrote in a summary of his thoughts: 'In case of each other's mind, only hurry, even generosity, generosity, sometimes suffering people, making each other feel to subdued him. It seems that the ability to convince people is poorly due to the lack of theoretical criticism of weapons'. His experience was profound, and"

				"memoirContent": " it was actually true. On the issue of political ideology, it can only be 'convince people', not to 'convince people.' For those who are accustomed to using two-sided tactics against the party, even if they talk about the party's policy a hundred times, he would easily refuse to admit mistakes if they did not put iron facts and evidence in front of them. What is more important is that without this, you cannot put the right-wing elements in stinky and transparent, they cannot be completely isolated from the masses, nor can we unite and educate the masses, expand our struggle team and achieve a complete victory in the fight against the right. Our experience in fighting Chippehin proves the correctness of the method of 'setting the facts and reasoning' in the struggle on the political ideological front, which the Central Committee has repeatedly instructed. \\nFinally, the main lesson of the work of the branch is that the leadership of the branch committee is not sufficiently aware of the arduous and complex nature of the reform of ideas and the struggle against the right, the lack of timely lessons learned, and the methods of work of the masses are not sufficiently applied, and therefore there are a number of shortcomings in both ideological and organizational work. In the early days of the campaign, the committee's knowledge of the comrades 'minds was very unspecific. For example: the central government decided to stay in school after the instructions issued, we only saw the active support side of the students, did not pay attention to resolving certain suspicions and resistance in a timely manner; the leadership of the branch, in general speaking, ideological mobilization is more adequate, but the imbalance between groups and groups, people and people, is not There is a timely solution; in the course of the exercise to the group leader more thought situations, but work with them to solve the ideas The approach to the problem is not enough; in helping to address serious right-leaning misconceptions and in the course of the critical struggle for alignment, some work has been done consciously for the ideological perceptions of the members of the Unity Group, but it has not been sufficient, particularly in the absence of assistance to the five groups. The lack of careful organization is not enough, comrades are busy; the lack of care in the task before sending out to investigate has caused some difficulties in the investigation. In the final phase of the anti-right struggle, the task was urgent and varied, and some speeches were reviewed in a rough manner and appeared to be particularly busy. Despite repeated criticism of the misconceptions of a few comrades, it seems that some of them have not yet been solved very deeply. While this is due to the lack of a high degree of ideological consciousness, individualism and complacency, these comrades have yet to be completely overcome. Thoughts look backwards, the burden cannot be put down, but it should also be noted that, on the other hand, there are shortcomings in the work of the Committee and the lack of detail and sometimes performance out of impatience. \\nPAGE\\nPAGE 9"

At that time, his family was home. In 1944, when Qi shian Shian attended Dunhuang secondary school, Fan Dengyun and Dunhuang Secondary School Principal Sheng Ren Wu introduced to join the Sanqing League. The preparatory office of Dunhuang was established, he was appointed by the Director of the Preparatory Office Fan Dengyun as deputy team leader of the Dunhuang Secondary School of the Sanqing League. In September 1946, after the establishment of the Dunhuang branch officer of the Sanqing League, Dunhuang Secondary School Branch was expanded into the team, he was elected as the first team leader. In the autumn of 1946, Qi shian Shian graduated from Dunhuang Secondary School (first). In November of the following year, he acted as a second unit member of the Dunhuang branch officer of the Sanqing League. Shortly thereafter, he went to East Street Primary School as an instructor. Qi shian Shian has an uncle who is poor at home and has been sick for many years. Qi shian Shian's grandfather gave him a good doctor, that is, he went to the countryside to help Qi shian Shian's father and gave him a home. When the land reform was introduced in Dunhuang in winter 1951, the Working Group could not count the amount of exploitation that Qi shianan had employed three half-permanent workers. In order to give Qi shianjiading landlords, the Land Reform Working Group also counted his uncle as a permanent worker of Qi shian's family. In this way, the composition of Qi shian Jia is determined by the landlord. \\nOn October 1, 1949, New China was founded. Qi shian Shian has enthusiastically invested in education, and still teaches at East Street Primary School. He served as a referee in the county's primary and secondary games every year, and still remains in the author's memory. There is one of the highest level games in the world-the Olympic Games, the author knows from the mouth of Teacher Qi shian. \\nIn June 1957, the CCP Dunhuang County Committee held a symposium to help the party rectify in the County Committee Hall (formerly the new hall). At that time, Chen Guoxiang of East Street Primary School was the principal, Wu Guotai was the teaching director, and Qi shian Shian was the deputy teaching director. Chen Guoxiang was invited to the symposium. The symposium was held for a week. In the afternoon of the last day of the meeting, the school leaves early. Wu Guotai and Qi shian Shian heard that the symposium had been warm. Out of curiosity, he went to the meeting for a while. Qi shian Shian did not speak at the meeting. \\nShortly after the symposium, East Street Primary School principal Chen Guoxiang and teaching director Wu Guotai were pulled out and exposed and criticized them. At this time, Dunhuang County entrusted to the East Street Primary School came to a new principal. Just a week later, the new principal asked Qi shian Shian to 'account for the problems.' Qi shian Shian said: 'I did not attend the symposium, nor did I show up. What do I want to give?' Soon, Qi shian Shian was designated as a right-wing element, leaving the job to control the use. In September of the same year, Qi shian Shian to South Street Elementary School is still a teacher. As for what questions were given to Qi shian Shianluo that year, when I asked him in January 2003, the old man's face was full of helplessness and confusion. 'I can't remember what problems they gave me at that time,' he said. \\nIn the spring of 2003, in Dunhuang City Archives, I saw a document issued on March 29, 1979 by the CCP's Dunhuang County Committee to correct the right-wing problem of Qi shian Shi'an, Ji Sengwu and others. On the paper, when it turned right in 1957, Qi shian Shian once said: 'There are wall ditches between party members and the masses, large walls, small walls, and glass walls. They see each other very clearly, that is not ventilation.' It is said that the then Dunhuang County Committee secretary said in a later anti-right summary that East Street Primary School completed the target task of three right-wing elements 'hat'. \\nIn the spring of 1966, in the early days of the 'Four Qi shianng' movement in Dunhuang, the 'Siqing' working group in South Street Primary School declared that Qi shian Shi'an was a right-wing and repatriated home to Qi shianjiaqiao Village to supervise labor. \\nIn the autumn of 1978, Qi shian Shian's right-wing problem was corrected and still returned to the original unit South Street Primary School. In February 1989, Qi shian Shian retired. \\nThe intriguing pain remains hidden, but the 'right-wing rhetoric' that changed his life has been forgotten. Obviously, those 'right-wing rhetoric' were imposed, and some people captured the wind. It is a no enemy hard to find out the enemy of the age, is no enemy hard to create the enemy of the age; and find out the enemy and the enemy must have a percentage! This ridiculous, absurd, never before! \\nPAGE 2"

Not only did Qi shiguang Shiguang not check well at the meeting, but instead took hate party and socialist sentiment, so it was calming and pretending to make a statement: 'The writing of the reactionary slogan is something I admit myself. I said I wrote it myself. I asked the leadership to continue to call the Public Security Bureau to investigate this person; Don't miss the person who really wrote the reactionary slogan because the hat was taken and admitted by me, then commit a bigger one against the people. Sin.' Please see, Qi shiguang Shiguang, the right-wing backbone, is actually such a cunning and insidious attempt to make a public rebuttal of the crime of writing reactionary slogan that he has already told. This can provoke the indignation of everyone. Hou Huaizhong immediately and solemnly debunked his conspiracy and stressed to him: 'You should carefully consider that there is only one path before you and bow to the people to confess guilt. Don't think about anything else, because you are young and should consider your own future.' \\nAt this time, the right-wing backbone, Qi shiguang Shiguang, was helplessly admitted to the fact that he was an attempt to reverse the case. On this day, he did not give a good account of his problems, but repeated the material that others had revealed. The right-wing, Qi shiguang Shiguang, is not only trying to reverse the case, but also blatantly defame the religious beliefs of the new society. \\nAt the conference on September 3, the right-wing backbone, Qi shiguang Shiguang, not only did not still have a positive attitude, but also played more arrogant, and openly provoked to everyone: 'It is not good to talk or not to talk, it makes me very difficult.' \\nOn September 4, the right-wing backbone, Qi shiguang Shiguang, continued to talk to you. 'First of all, I admit that yesterday, the day before yesterday, there was a place to deceive everyone. I didn't talk to the people at home when I came home, and that's all fake, and I did deceive everyone.' In this way, once again under everyone's poor chase, he finally had to confess the trick he had to go home with his brother, trying to turn the case out. \\nAt the conference on September 5, the insidious cunning right-wing backbone, Qi shiguang Shiguang, under the repeated questioning of everyone, he always pretended to answer: 'In the face of the facts, I am untenable, only honestly bow to confess guilt, completely transform myself and criticize myself.' So the faculty members have spoken and deeds on Qi shiguang Shiguang's very vicious reactionaries: 'The town is too cruel,' 'the Communist Party has no democracy', 'Communist Party members are selfish, privileged, who is in control of the regime', 'the expansion of the 'anti-counter', 'press infreedom' and 'Hungarian events are due to the events in Hungary' 'caused by the Government's disregard for the lives of the people' and so forth, has made a profound and forceful rebuttal. Many teachers and staff have enumerated countless concrete facts and figures, which fully attest to the great achievements of more than eight years after the liberation of our country under the correct leadership of the Party and more than a hundred years, and have ruthlessly broken down the reactionary fallacy of the right-wing backbone, Qi shiguang Shiguang.

According to the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), just as the winding movement of industrial and mining enterprises deepened, some factories and mining enterprises found anti-revolutionaries, right-wing elements and other bad elements to carry out sabotage activities. Such as: Benxi, Jinzhou and other places found reactionary slogans; rightists of the Jinzhou iron alloy factory held small meetings in the back of the ground; Fushun city chimney companies and other units found 22 tabloid papers in the name of the masses, with editors, reporters, and members of the right-wing and center-right elements participating; the Anshan tannery found. There are 12 people, including seven right-wing and center-right elements, who ostensively helped lead the wind , which also rejects the wrong opinion, but its political profile and backward activities have yet to be found. Right elements of the Third Engineering Agency in Fushun City, together with Shumen, used the materials of employees criticizing the leadership in the big print newspaper to attack the leadership. Incidents of destruction of production were also detected. Such as the continuous destruction of Benxi Iron and Steel Company's second chemical plant, a carbonization chamber on the 28th, the temperature suddenly dropped by 100 degrees. After it was found that there were five wire on the 20th, blocking the gas pipeline. The plant electrician King Embo (the fleeing landlord, relatives were suppressed), in the Madari, where he overhauled, was found two meters of sack pieces. On October 16, it was discovered that the contact signal line between the dispatch room and the blower had been cut off. The newly installed gas engine of the brigda gas company also found four pieces of iron. Beipiao mine transport unit repairers will cut the tram line. The above shows that the enemy is breaking the ring of our wind movement and production construction, we should cause serious attention and vigilance. We hope that municipalities and land committees will be vigilant against right-wing and bad elements that have been found in the wedge movement, although they do not openly criticize, and leaders, masses and themselves have made it clear that those who hold important positions must be transferred and monitored in order to prevent sabotage accidents. All types of sabotage incidents that have taken place should be investigated immediately and the cases are dealt with seriously. All kinds of current counter-revolutionary and bad elements should be arrested and brought to justice and strictly dealt with. (Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China)"

He graduated from high school and took part in the revolution without going to college. He sings very well, with a rough, thick, deep, typical baritone. I love to hear him sing 'Evening outside Moscow', 'Song of the Komsomolskaya' and 'Days of the Liberated Zone'. Later we were not in a group, but I met, and there was always something to say. He was born straight, righteous, kind, the group had poor physical strength, labor did not complete the quota, he often took the initiative to help them; two people lift the basket, he always pulled the rope to his side a little. He said his family was poor and only parents. After he was in jail, I thought that he certainly couldn't come back, because he was a Mulberry Bien-rather than bending, he would not yield, would not flatter, let alone flatter, and the prison staff least like someone like him, and the least disdain of a person like him. He was said to have been executed on the charge of 'organizing a jailbreak', and I think it was impossible, not to obey discipline, and to fight with the prison officials. But he is rational and knowledgeable, and will not do illegal, undivided things. When the right was declared a correction, he was killed in jail and also declared rebellion, organized to go to his home town to declare the matter. His parents had long been away from the world, and few of the neighbors seemed to know him. Want to hang him, and now do not even know where the corpse is buried, left in my memory, only that singing in the misty alkali river. 'Shiro! Where does the soul return?' ]]"

Now Assistant Minister of Health of the People's Republic of China, member of the Party Group. \\nThe party organization of the Ministry of Health in the late part of the fourth phase of the wind, denounced and criticized Qi zhonghuan's serious anti-people crimes against the people, arguing that he was a class dissident and far-right element who was mixed into the party. His sinful facts are as follows:\\nFirst, the leader of the opposition party believes that laymen cannot lead the internal affairs, and have consistently confronted the party on several major health policy policies. The Party proposed 'political hands-on'. Qi zhonghuan believes that politics cannot lead the business, want politics to serve the business, preach that 'doing business is the best politics'. 'The Ministry of Health is not less politics, but more politics and less technology.' Advocates that the Ministry of Health should request 'experts' to serve as leadership. \\nThe basic line of the party's health cause is to carry out the health campaign of 600 million people under the leadership of the Party, relying on the masses. Qi zhonghuan is the leader of the opposition party, not the masses, technical supremacy, and rely solely on experts and professional institutions. For example, on the issue of epidemic prevention stations, the party group insists that in order to facilitate the unity of leadership, close integration and better use of the potential of medical personnel, it should basically focus on comprehensive institutions and carry out mass health and epidemic prevention work. Qi Zi insists on the establishment of epidemic prevention stations, maternal and child health stations, and prevention and control agencies for various diseases, from provincial to county, to the end, specializing in many disciplines, focusing on technology and not for public health work. For this reason, for a long time confrontation with the party group, not listening to the Party In order to resist the party group, when the right is attacking the party, summoned so-called 'expert symposia' (many of them are right-wing elements), to discuss the issue of epidemic prevention stations and find anti-party capital. In June 1957, after attending the Ministry of Health's revelation meeting, praised the remarks of right-wing elements attacking the Ministry of Health, requiring the party group to conduct a 'comprehensive inspection' and echoing the right-wing offensive. \\nIn the field of medical prevention, in 1958 the party directed that prevention should be carried out at the centre of the hospital. This directive of the Party is of great importance to reform the irrational phenomenon of the division of treatment and disease prevention in the past health institutions, but Qi has openly resisted and spread discontent everywhere. \\nOn the issue of birth control, Qi zhonghuan has faltered the spirit of the party's family planning with the reactionary view of the Marsatian population theory. It believed that many people are the root cause of disaster poverty, and promoted this reactionary view at the National Birth Control Report Conference held in 1958, and strongly advocated that the great leap forward in women's and children's work is both an efficient exercise. Parenting work, proposing to 'constant' the Chinese population, essentially makes the Chinese population Towards reduction and perish. \\nQi zhonghuan also published many editorials and articles contrary to the Party's health policy policy, using the newspaper 'Health newspaper', an organ of the Ministry of Health, causing the following confusion. \\nQi zhonghuan also resisted the policy of the central government's decision to decentralize the system. He said: 'The subordination of units directly under the Ministry of Health is not to exert local independence and motivation, it is the idea of losing the burden.' It also impedes the implementation of the Party's resolutions on decentralized bodies. \\nQi zhonghuan's decision on some of the major issues of the Party is also far-flouted. In the case of a major death in 1957, an encephalitis vaccine was administered by the party group. However, he was extremely irresponsible, dragging this major issue, affecting the health and lives of the people in general, for a year, without drawing conclusions or reporting to the party group. \\nSecond, Qi zhonghuan attacked and defamed the leadership of the party group, created division of the Party, undermined the unity of the party, and carried out conspiracy activities in an attempt to usurp the leadership of the Party. Qi zhonghuan's anti-party tactics are insidious and spicy, good at disguising himself and playing with two methods. He used the so-called following opinion to attack the party group and said: 'Health does not pay attention to business, the Party group does not solve problems, it does not work, and the Ministry of Health can have nothing.' He also carried out a vicious attack on the State Department. \\nDuring the whole wind movement, Qi zhonghuan took the opportunity to ignite the fire, attacking the party group in an attempt to break down the party group. In the early days of the whole winds movement, he has been spreading 'no confidence' in the party group meetings, asking 'the Central Committee and the Propaganda Department to send people to lead', while facing attacks against rebellion and not paying much attention to business in the Ministry, right-wing remarks strongly praised. In the early days of the wind, and during the fight against the right, Qi zhonghuan used his power to convene two so-called 'expert symposia' in Beijing and Shanghai to support right-wing speech in the health community and attacking the party. At that time, Qi Zhong-Huan had been a behind-the-scenes planner of attacks by right-wing members of the health community against the party. \\nThird, it has consistently excluded the fight against old cadres, appoint bad guys, cultivate their own forces, and stand up with the party chambers. During his work in the Central South Ministry of Health, Qi placed a large number of KMT health officials and politicians. He also placed many KMT health officers in the central and southern provinces and municipalities. Most of these people have serious political history problems, some are anti-revolutionary elements, some have blood debt, people are extremely indignant, and some people have asked to fight them after liberation, but they are all sheltered. Many section chiefs and clerks are also anti-revolutionary and political suspects searched from all sides. At that time, the Zhongnan Ministry of Health had a statement that the KMT was in charge of the Communist Party \\nAfter Qi came to the Ministry of Health, many parties also managed to recommend him to work at the Ministry of Health in the heart of the Central South Health Ministry. In the aftermath of the struggle between the anti-opposition and anti-right movements, the alignment of counter-revolutionaries and right-wing elements remains very reused. \\nOn the contrary, Qi zhonghuan has consistently crackled out the old cadres who are loyal to the Party, and slander the old cadre is 'earthy buns, I don't know how to pull the shit.' It is also very hostile to the Party's cadre work and defense work. \\nIn addition, Qi zhonghuan is also extremely corrupt in life style and moral quality. \\nQi zhonghuan's problem is extremely serious, and there is a systematic reactionary bourgeois ideological view of the bourgeois; politically consistent policy of the opposition party, the leadership of the opposition party; in the organization it has always relied on the KMT health ministry officials, sheltering opponents and right-wing elements, cracking down on old cadres and provoking Diverting, carrying out separatist party activities in an attempt to usurp the leadership of the party. Its nature is class dissidents in the Party. It is an old right-wing anti-socialist anti-socialist who has long been hidden in the party. On September 28, 1958, the committee of organs of the Ministry of Health of the Communist Party of China decided to dismiss Qi zhonghuan from the party.

				"memoirContent": "【Attachment 2】'Health newspaper': 'The Ministry of Health in the fourth stage of rectification wind excavation of the extreme right molecule Qi zhonghuan' (October 25, 1958)\\nIn the fourth phase of the rectification movement, the Ministry of Health excavated class dissidents, far-right, Qi zhonghuan (former assistant minister of health minister and party member of the Ministry of Health). This is a huge victory on the pharmaceutical and health front. Under the leadership of the Party, all the cadres of the Ministry of Health have fought for more than two months against the far-right, Qi zhonghuan, and completely debunked all the conspiracy activities of Qi zhonghuan's opposition party, anti-socialism and attempted to usurp the leadership of the Party. In the face of a large number of facts, the far-right, Qi zhonghuan, began to cunning resistance, but finally could not surrender without arms. \\nFrom the beginning of his mixing into the revolution, Qi zhonghuan has always been the leadership of the opposition party, distorting and destroying the Party's guidelines, policies, excluding, combating old cadres, sheltering, reusing bad guys, counter-revolutionaries, old officials, cultivating personal power, engaging in an independent kingdom, provoking discord, undermining the unity of the party, creating a division of the party, and usurping Grab the party leader. \\nQi zhonghuan has long believed that politics cannot lead business and want politics to serve business. He often preached that 'the Ministry of Health has more politics and less business.' He said the party leaders 'neither understand the business nor listen to 'experts'.' He therefore advocated that the Ministry of Health should invite 'experts' to serve as leadership, relying on and empowering them. Qi zhonghuan also made great efforts to belittle and erase the achievements of socialist health cause. He openly spread 'the Ministry of Health is loving behind' at all cadres meeting of the Ministry of Health, saying 'The Ministry of Health's work has not improved for a few years'. 'Comrade He Cheng can catch business even though he made mistakes,' saying, 'If he made a mistake, he can catch the business'. Is the best politics'. Use these fallacies to the leadership of the opposition party and oppose political manners. \\nQi zhonghuan has always distorted the guidelines, directives and resolutions of the opposition central party and the Ministry of Health Party on health work, and insisted on his bourgeois reactionary path. The basic line of the Party's health cause is to rely on the masses to carry out the health movement of 600 million people under the leadership of the Party, and Qi zhonghuan is the leader of the opposition, not the masses, technical supremacy, and simply rely on 'experts' and professional institutions. For example, on the issue of health and epidemic prevention stations at the county level, the party advocates that, in order to facilitate unity of leadership, close integration, in order to better realize the potential of medical personnel, should basically focus on comprehensive and public health prevention work. Qi Zhongheng advocates the establishment of epidemic prevention stations, maternal and child health stations, and various diseases prevention and control institutions, from the province to the county. The result is that there are many specialties and subdivisions, focusing on technology and not doing public health work. When the party party will discuss this issue, the vast majority of comrades agree with the decision of the party group. When he justifies poor rhetoric, he arbitrarily attacked comrades of the party group and said, 'You do not understand the epidemic prevention station, have not entered the gate of the epidemic prevention station. How can you discuss the issue of epidemic prevention stations?' When right-wing elements attacked the Ministry of Health, attacking the Ministry of Health 'does not pay attention to the precautionary approach, and it is not good for the epidemic station to engage in the patriotic health movement', and Qi zhonghuan greatly praised 'it's too good to mention, give us a lot of inspiration,' and asked the party group to conduct a 'comprehensive inspection'. What is more intolerable is that Qi zhonghuan litigates the removal of four hazards and hygiene as 'small things' that 'have no scientific value', and incited health and epidemic prevention agency personnel not to participate in patriotic health campaigns, but to do technical guidance and conduct scientific research, otherwise it is 'not doing business.' 'The disease is a cyclical onset and cannot be raised with a slogan to eliminate it,' he said. He is not interested in the number of people everywhere to eliminate the four hazards, saying, 'These do not make sense, only if the density is reduced will really make sense'. These fallacies of Qi zhonghuan cause great confusion among health and epidemic prevention personnel. \\nLast week, the premier of the Third Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party directed 'expanding prevention and directing health prevention work at the local and industrial and mining centers with hospitals at the center.' This directive of the Party is of great importance to reform the irrational phenomenon of the division of treatment and disease prevention in the past health institutions. Qi zhonghuan publicly resisted, questioning the Party group 'who reflected the opinion to the prime minister' and said rampant: 'The Prime Minister does not understand the situation'. 'What does the hospital do for prevention and epidemic prevention stations?' \\nOn the issue of birth control, Qi zhonghuan has faltered the spirit of the party's family planning with the reactionary view of the Malsatian population theory, believing that many people are the root cause of disaster poverty, and promoted his reactionary view at the National Birth Control Report Conference held in spring 1958, taking advantage of the individual examples reflected below. It is intended to say the issue of the birth of the population as a spooky and horrible one, simply emphasizing China's large population Life is very difficult. Strongly advocating that a great leap forward in work for women and children is to carry out birth control work, advocate 'one son, one daughter and one woman live Buddha, more than one daughter, more than one woman, more than one woman, more than one woman, more than wrong', and promote 'three generations can not work together' and 'constant' the Chinese population. In essence, it is to reduce and die in China's population. \\nQi zhonghuan also resisted the central policy of deciding on institutional decentralization. When the party group discussed this policy of implementing the central decision, it was said: 'The subordination of units directly under the Ministry of Health is not to exert local independence and enthusiasm. Submissions are the idea of losing the burden', naked slander of the central decision and the intention of the party group. When the party group decided to submit to the Institute of Biological Products, the Institute of Epidemiology and other institutions, then there were different opinions under the pretext below to obstruct the implementation of the Party's resolutions. Qi zhonghuan believes that the leadership method of the local party committee is 'singles one', thinks that it is wrong for health personnel to participate in the work of the center, and to discredit the party committees at all levels that do not pay attention to health work. \\nQi zhonghuan also used the health newspaper, an organ of the Ministry of Health, as a tool to promote the bourgeoisie health path, and he published many editorial articles and articles in the Health Newspaper that contradicted the Party's policy of health work, causing confusion in the following thoughts. \\nQi zhonghuan's decision on some of the major issues of the Party is also far-flouted. If a major death occurred in 1957, when an encephalitis vaccine was vaccinated, the party group called Qi zhonghuan responsible for careful examination and treatment. He initially refused to examine the fallacy of 'vaccinating dead people is an inevitable thing all over the world,' he refused to check; he was irresponsible in the inspection, and organized a seven-member inspection team without the consent of the party group, led by Tang Feifan, director of the Biological Products Research Institute and right-wing activist Tang Feifan (refusing to transform, have feared suicide), Row check. And say, 'Let them check themselves, this is a technical problem that you don't understand can't solve'. In fact, Qi zhonghuan aims to exonerate them from their guilt. In order to achieve the above anti-party proposition and achieve his purpose of usurping the leadership of the Party, Qi zhonghuan has carried out a series of conspiracy activities in addition to consistently using both sides of the anti-party approach. At the beginning of the wind, Qi zhonghuan thinks that the time has come, he borrowed the opportunity for the whole wind, foment the wind to fire, and together with right-wing elements to attack the party group. While spreading 'no confidence' in the party group meeting, he asked 'the Central Committee and the Propaganda Department to send people to lead,' while facing the right-wing remarks attacking the party strongly praised. Zhou Youfen, a right-wing activist, said to the party attacking: 'The Party is the ruler' and 'the new society is tyranny' and so on. Qi zhonghuan said, 'Good wow Just as Dr. Zhou came like this, like this statement.' In the early days of the wind, Qi zhonghuan convened two so-called 'experts' symposia in Beijing and Shanghai, with the status of assistant minister of health and party group membership and authority. The right-wing element Fan Rixin came to Beijing in January 1957 from Shanghai to attend a general health teacher training class at the Public Health Department of the Beijing Medical College, chaired by right-wing Kim Baoshan. Prior to the meeting, Qi zhonghuan had asked Fan Rixin to come to his house for dinner and incited, 'Politics cannot replace business.' 'Health Section Eighth Route Army and the New Four.' Rejecting the Party's leadership in health work, supporting right-wing rhetoric, allowing Jin Baoshan and Fan Rih to the new flow. More unscrupulous attacks against the Party in Beijing, Shanghai and other places. Until June 8 last year, the People's Daily editorial, 'Why is this?' After publication, Qi zhonghuan still convened a 'expert' symposium, openly shouting for right-wing elements and saying: 'The Ministry of Health has solicited too few opinions from experts, limiting the role of experts.' And the defiance of the party is 'only a gust of wind.' While the Ministry of Health dealt with right-wing elements, he also struggled to exonerate the rightists and insisted on retaining some of them. \\nQi zhonghuan's leadership of the party group of the Ministry of Health has done its best to attack and slander. He used the so-called 'following opinion' to attack the party group, saying: 'The Ministry of Health does not pay attention to business, the party group does not solve the problem and does not work. The Ministry of Health has nothing to do.' 'The ministry of health bureaucracy, subjectivity, anything, there is no Marxinism,' he said at the party group rectification meeting. He also publicly praised Comrade He Cheng for daring to resist the Central Committee, dare to act, and to stigmatize the party leadership comrades firmly in obeying the implementation of the central directive resolution is 'only vino', 'timid fear' and 'style is not high quality'. \\nQi zhonghuan also often spread rumors, provoke discord among members of the party group, confuse whether or not, and create divisions within the Party. In January this year, in order to clarify the confusion in the implementation of the policy of Chinese medicine, the party group held a seminar on traditional Chinese medicine. It was originally very good. Qi zhonghuan, neither participated in the discussion, but spread 'the motivation of the Party Group to hold a seminar on traditional Chinese medicine is impure, not good intentions'. It was 'promoting retreat' and 'wounding money by laborers'. Dial-up. While discussing the different opinions of the members of the Chinese Medicine Working Party Group, Qi zhonghuan also took the opportunity to proclaim that party leaders do not understand traditional Chinese medicine and that they should listen to the words of traditional Chinese medicine in order to spread the fallacy that laymen could not lead the industry. \\nAfter the wind entered the advanced stage, Qi zhonghuan became more rampant, and the opportunity to slander the party group retreat was 'deserted, deserted, miserable.' At the same time, he also used the words 'below' to exaggerate the shortcomings of the party group, negate the achievements of the Ministry of Health, create chaos, and borrow troops to the whole party group below. And viciously said: 'The problem of our Ministry of Health is mainly the problem of party secretary'. During the party retreat expansion meeting, some directorate directors proposed strengthening the core of the leadership of the Party, stressing that party members should support the party group and maintain the unity of the Party, and so on. Qi zhonghuan thinks these opinions are wrong. In April, the party group retreat, Party leader comrade Qi zhonghuan suggested that he should examine political and business, personal and party relations. After the meeting, Qi zhonghuan had a big temper, and said in an abusive tone: 'This kid (referring to his comrade who gave his opinion), is really abhorrent! It's not that I have two hearts with the party, saying I am the right?' Demonstrating to the party group. \\nAs Qi zhonghuan attempted to usurp the leadership of the party, he struggled to compete for power by all means, cultivate personal power, expand his opposition positions, and resist the party's chambers. During his time in the Central and South Ministry of Health, Qi used his authority, on the pretext of needing technical cadres, and placed a large number of KMT health department officials, and hosted many anti-revolutionaries and bad elements. For example, Yang Yongnian, one of the four major King Kong of the Kuomintang Health Department, is the director of Wuhan Biological Products Institute (now sentenced to a moratorium on execution); Bai Yudao, secretary of the Kuomintang Health Department, who has no technical knowledge of health technology, has been placed as secretary of the Central South Ministry of Health and so on. On the contrary, old party cadres are excluded, attacked, and even persecuted on the pretext of lack of culture and lack of technology. This led to the assertion that the Zhongnan Ministry of Health had 'the KMT in charge of the Communist Party' and 'the Central South Ministry of Health is the KMT Small Health Department', causing extremely bad effects and losses to the Party. \\nQi zhonghuan is extremely hostile to the work of cadres and the work of the Party, the regiment and the defense work. His vicious attack on personnel work is 'criticized', 'the memory of doing personnel work is really strong, remember people who make mistakes'. The unified war policy of defamating the party is to 'throw a long line, hook big fish'. During the discussion of the preparation, he strongly argued that 'the less the establishment of the party committee office and the protection department, the better, fewer people can do less.' \\nQi zhonghuan has never been satisfied with the positions and powers given to him by the party, always striving for himself. As a medical director in the early days of the new four armed forces, he reached out to the Party for 'human rights' and 'financial rights'. In the early days of liberation, he was asked to be the Director of the Central Ministry of Health's Bureau of Epidemic Prevention, and After the withdrawal of the region in 1954, he was asked to serve as vice-president of the Union Medical College, and he was required to act as deputy president and political council. After coming to the Ministry of Health in 1955, because of being an assistant minister and dissatisfied, 'three years of gambling'. Qi zhonghuan also took advantage of some comrades who had been confused by him for the time and resonated with him in his thoughts, to carry out pulls and pull and pull, seal officials wish, in an attempt to cultivate and expand his own anti-party force. \\nQi zhonghuan is also extremely corrupt in the style of life, pursuing the bourgeois way of life, has repeatedly played insulting lesbians, and the moral quality is extremely damaging. \\nQi zhonghuan's series of anti-party activities were by no means accidental, but had his class roots and historical origins. Qi zhonghuan was born in feudal landowners, bureaucratic politicians, and Chinese slave families, and received imperialist slavery education from childhood. After graduating from Liaoning Medical College in 1935, he relied on warlords commercial shock. He was the health director of the Beijing-Han Railway and the dean of the Henan smoking cessation hospital. In just a few months, he searched dozens of gold. After the outbreak of the anti-Japanese war, he also wanted to fight against Japan and become a dream of fortune. In 1937, he joined the Forces nouvelles, and soon \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), wavered away from the revolution and ran to the KMT rule. In Chongqing, he was a technician of the Kuomintang Health Department, and later opened in Kunming and other places with British Dr. John's Yannu sign, until March 1941, after the wannan incident, returned to the new four army. Such a person with political ambitions of class dissidents, of course, will not genuinely revolutionize, and return to the revolutionary ranks for the second time he has been carrying out all kinds of anti-party plots against the people. \\nAfter the right-wing activist Qi zhonghuan was excavated, all the cadres of the Ministry of Health launched a fierce struggle against this right. From July 16 to September 28, the Ministry of Health held 10 meetings to expand the party group, 26 meetings of all party members and cadres, and posted more than 500 large print papers that criticize Qi zhonghuan's anti-party words and deeds. In the latter stage of criticism of Qi zhonghuan, provincial and municipal health departments and directors also attended the conference. They were extremely angry at Qi zhonghuan's anti-party words and deeds. They have expressed their determination to fight with far-right activists Qi zhonghuan to the end, and resolutely clear Qi zhonghuan's influence in the health sector.

				"memoirContent": "【Attached】Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China: 'Approval of Expulsion of Rightists' (1958.5)\\nQuan ming, former deputy secretary of Yuxi Dian Committee of Yunnan Province, the anti-right struggle. According to the materials of the Yuxi Dian Committee, it is proved that it is all one of the backbone elements of Zheng Dun and Wang Jingru opposition group, and is an individualist ambition. He joined the party in order to seek a personal way out, and after joining the party and at times for his own power. When in Vietnam. Smuggling tax evasion, armed trafficking smoke, do everything. Guangdong and Yunnan troops are treated differently. After coming to the Provincial Tax Bureau, they also pulled up a group of anti-bad elements, retained personnel, as well as taking advantage of some unreformed intellectuals, people with localist sentiments, to exclude crackdown on old cadres. After leaving the tax office, he also wanted to be deputy director of the provincial committee and vice-secretary of Chuxiong Land Committee. Quan ming went to Yuxi with Zheng Dun's instructions. Zheng Seo-Quan spoke, saying Comrade Liu Shijie was about to transfer to study, suggesting that the first secretary of the Land Commission would be all in charge. After that, all and Zheng have maintained close contact, where Zheng Lai Yuxi, all will follow, Zheng in 1955 in Asan pilot Sanding, all initiative to go with. Yuxi one has something. That is, to Zheng and Wang, such as Comrade Liu Shijie, food issues right, etc., are all coming from Zheng and Wang. Before the province of full adjustment, Wang Jingru talked with All once, and later forced Comrade Liu Shijie to review. Wang also said that 'there are objections within the Party, it is not a bad thing.' After the full tune of Kunming, Zheng and Wang are still looking for a few conversations. The above material proves that their opposition is entirely systematic and purposeful. \\n(i), Opposition\\n1. The cadre lines of the opposition party, hate to attack and trap old cadres, cultivate their reactionary forces, and disregard the old cadres on the one hand, and spread comrade Liu Shijie, the first secretary of the Yuxi Land Committee, 'rude', 'arbitrariness', 'undemocratic', and stigmatize Liu's reception of the central and provincial committee responsible comrades, 'thinking' Want to be bad consciousness, irregularities', or even say 'butt' and so on. Stigma Shanghui three comrades 'seduce youth', 'vulgar, less ideological' and so on. Using the trial to dry the machine to strike, said that Shanghui three is 'trooppers'. The fabricated Kunyang Shu Feng Guidong privately named his lover Zhao Yin as a candidate for the county committee without the consent of the land committee. On the other hand, the organization is headed by Quan ming and Liu Dejun, including key members such as Zhao Wenlin, Yang Shufa, Yao Ziqiang and other key members. At the same time, a group of unreformed young intellectuals, including right-wing elements Tang Maochang and Yang Ce, formed an anti-party group in an attempt to usurp the leadership of the Land Commission. As early as in the provincial tax office, all of them relied on a group of anti-bad elements (such as bourgeois agent He Ruchang, anti-revolutionary Ye Lin, etc.), to retain personnel (Fu Ji Yun, etc.), to pull and exploit some unreformed young intellectuals and people with localist sentiments (Fang good intentions, etc.), to exclude and fight against Party veteran cadres (such as Liu Zheng and Comrade Yan Yili, etc.), their anti-party activities are consistent. \\n2. The democratic centralization of the opposition parties is arbitrary and arbitrary. All of them always appear in the name of the Land Committee at various meetings in order to deceive trust. In fact, his report in any meeting has not been studied by the Land Committee or consulted with other comrades beforehand. The issues decided by the Land Committee must be set up in a separate set. \\nAll Ming on the ground committee, the lower anti-grassroots branch. He set up the three key communes of the Land Committee to divide labor between the party and government, and advocate cooperative social management of production, branch management thinking, management policy, and administration by the township government'. In the aftermath, according to the book, the cadres of the commune township pulled the rack, there was no place for the books to hang the party flag, there was no lighting for meetings, and there was no oil, and the work branch and cooperatives pushed \\nTo engage in extreme democracy, in the food triumphs, it does not speak at all about launching the masses, criticizing capitalist ideas, and fighting against the enemy. Instead, it emphasizes that leadership must review and focus on criticism. As a result, the branch was reorganized and alternate party members acted as a supporting book. On the issue of the Party Congress, he fully briefed Zheng Dun's experience of 'democracy only when fighting against the county committee committee', and said that the Jinning Party Congress is not democratic and must not be repeated again in Kunyang. Incited others to say 'there was much concentration in the past, some people could not see their wives all day long', and the vicious attack said, 'You are home, the members are slaves, there is no democracy'. \\n(ii), Opposition to socialism\\n1. Oppose agricultural cooperation. All explicitly advocates that the cooperative movement should be less, slow and small, the reason is that 'cooperation is faster, more, bigger, and will affect production.' Emphasizing voluntary membership, and said, 'Why should it be so fast, it is Liu Shijie's personal prominence.' In actual work, he strongly opposes one village and one society, and when cooperation is basically achieved, collected materials everywhere, negated achievements, and aggressively attacked 'cooperation is not as good as single households' and 'side business management is better than doing alone'. At the same time, he also carries out anti-' risking' activities, scolding that cooperation is 'subjective,' It is the inferior, blind, insane, one-sided nature of the small bourgeois'. \\n2. Oppose advanced production indicators and measures. Clearly grasping the individual drawbacks in the promotion of advanced experiences that have been tested successfully, namely, a massive attack said that 'cadres forced farmers to cut 'plum cigarettes', this is to treat people as slaves and themselves as their bosses', and finally even say this is 'the dark side of the proletarian dictatorship'. And on the assumption that 'Comrade Ma Jikong said that production indicators should not be too dead', oppose the resolution of the Land Commission to expand the area of rapeseed cultivation. \\n3. Distortion of food policy. On the issue of food, there is a full proposition to buy more than less. 1956 openly returned to the provincial committee assigned grain task, and laid out at the county book meeting that 'to buy as little as possible, the grain can also be sold a little more.' It also categorically negates past achievements in food work. \\n4. Support sympathy and praise right-wing rhetoric and undermining the struggle against the right. All in the Foreign Trade Bureau advocated the transfer of the anti-party newspaper to various units to exchange, and saw that the attack on Xie's Political Commission was a 'bureaucratic' big print, saying 'mark it out'. On the other hand, he strongly appreciated the extreme right, Huang Zhongliu 'has the ability to be a chief of section,' when cadres report on the bourgeois offensive situation, 'whether the bourgeois is a little good thing,' said 'people are familiar with their business.' When delineating the right, they did not agree to classify Cao Zhen and Ye Lin as the right, saying, 'They are not fundamentally opposed to socialism by the opposition, but are only dissatisfied with the leadership of the party group.' \\nIn addition, the all-encompassing life is also extremely erosive, and it took two months to choose the style alone, all in order to make a coat, through all the Soviet Illustrated newspapers. \\nYunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China approved the dismissal of the right-wing elements of the party.

He is an organizer and propaganda in the small group. He organized six anti-party symposia and participated in the planning and leadership, editor-in-chief of the anti-party newspaper 'Democratic Life'. \\nSecond, at the NLD symposium viciously attacked the party leadership and the proletarian dictator.

'I think the party is wrong, the Party's mistake is that it is keen to India, is not good at regular work, usually infrequent inspection and supervision, not to solve problems in a timely manner, it is not possible to rely on the movement.'

Published his own books in 1956. Later Grandpa from teaching Mr. did the provost of Qingdao Teachers Training College. My mother often told me that life was good at home, and when I was young, and my babysitter was also served by my grandmother. \\nIn 1957, when Mao Zedong called on the people of mainland China to help the Communist Party, it was the beginning of grandfather's doom.

('Reveal Qingdao People's League Qubeiwei' People's Daily 1957.6.28)\\nThat is to see Grandpa's remarks more than half a century ago today, and it really admires the golden eyes of Grandpa's fire. Grandpa, he asked such a sharp question, debunking the Chinese Communist Party's paintings. Can the CCP not be ashamed and angry? So Grandpa was beaten as right-wing elements and re-education through labour for three years and eight months 24 days. Then Grandpa became a hat-picking right. \\nDuring the Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976, the People's Daily published a critique of ceramic casting (then the third figure of the Chinese Communist Party), once again named criticizing my grandfather, an intellectualist who was just right now. Qingdao city immediately held a meeting of 100,000 people to re-bring the right hat to grandpa and was reformed by labor. During this period, Grandpa was punished to repair the railway. Mom later told me that Grandpa thought of suicide many times because he could not endure this mental and physical inhumane torture, but he thought more about his family-grandma and five children-and bitten his teeth to persist and tenacious alive. \\nUntil 1980 was called rebellion. Grandpa was paralyzed and unable to speak because of years of mental and physical torture. Grandpa died on 28 April 1982. At that time, I heard and remember that Qingdao Radio had broadcast the news of my grandpa's death. \\nIn China, which has so far suffered, it is those who are honest, kind, selfless and dare to speak the truth. The fact of countless blood proves that the evil CCP regime has not changed from the beginning of its illegal construction. \\nPeople may remember Gao Zhisheng, Guo Quan, Liu Xiaobo, and Huang Qi who were convicted for defending their rights speech. But the people have rarely talked about or are concerned about the fact that Falun Gong practitioners who have been illegally arrested by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), to date cannot be calculated with exact figures, are being held in re-education through labour without the so-called legal process and even sentenced to heavy sentences. It was confirmed that between July 1999 and January 2010, a total of 3,352 Falun Gong trainees died during 126 months of unlawful persecution by the CCP. Is there any other country on this planet to be retrained through labour for mere faith, imprisonment, to torture to death. \\nThe end of the endless cold night is dawn.

Although we were all 'rectified' after 1978, we resumed work, but soon reached the retirement age, the salary levels were significantly lower, some were treated as landless farmers, and some had died, but the families were still living at the lowest level. There are many people whose families are fragmented, so far the children of the company have failed to compensate, and grievances are faded. We are unable to afford or look sick and become a vulnerable group in society. \\nThe dead are hated, and the rest of the survivors will hate for life. To this end, only by reflecting the facts to you, please solve it in a timely manner in accordance with the Party's policy of 'people-oriented and harmonious society'. The right correction in 1978 was re-examined on the basis of the 1957 Criteria for the Partition of the Right, believing that the words and deeds of those of us should not be classified as rightists, and sent a 'right-wing correction notice' to resume work. Since we do not belong to the right, at that time we were dismissed, demoted, reduced, dismissed or sent to re-education through miscalculation of the right, and the wages withheld and reduced should be paid back at the same time, just as the Cultural Revolution's 'misappropriation and misappropriation case' was only in compliance with the statutory procedure. Not to mention the misrepresentation of the right who suffered longer and suffered more, at that time it was not allowed to argue, and was still forced by the organization's dictatorship. It is unjust and reasonable, however, that the wages of the wrong sentence have not yet been paid. In contravention of the principle of 'equality before the law' enshrined in the Constitution, it would be wrong to treat citizens equally, not to speak of fairness and justice, and to establish 'double standards', so that the law was reasonable. Our Constitution considers 'citizens' wage income as the first legal income protected by law.' Article 41 of the 1954 Constitution states: 'Persons who have suffered damages as a result of violations of civil rights by State organs and agents of the State shall have the right to compensation in accordance with the law.' Repayment of wages to the right is done in accordance with the law and upholds the dignity of our Constitution. It is a violation of the Constitution, and the relevant departments and staff should be held accountable according to the law. \\nWe are not begging for gifts, we are legitimate debt collection. This is our legitimate legitimate right to forcible labor that we have been wrongly handled over the past two decades. Our Civil Code also explicitly states: 'The person in charge has the obligation to pay the debt.' Wages owed to the right are clearly a government debt, while the government has for a long time ignored and inacted on the reminders of creditors. This is neither wise nor an act of knowledge and law. The long delay, the Government loses its integrity, fairness and justice, and the hearts and minds of the people. Such inaction is extremely detrimental to the construction of a harmonious society that is 'fair and just'. If it is wrong, you should change it. If you work, you should pay it, and the debt owed should be repaid. This is a natural and righteous affair. It is that we are rich, and the Government should all compensate, in order to reflect our country's democratic respect for the rule of law in order to build a harmonious society, not to mention that our victims are still living at the bottom of society. \\nDear Dean of the High School, although you are not the makers of mistakes at that time, we will not blame you, but you are the successors of the party and the government. You are the heirs of the party and the government. You have the duty and duty to solve the historical legacy of the party and to pay back our salaries for more than 20 years in order to dissolve our current life. The dilemma. This is a kind move to share worries for the country, solve grievances for the people, get the hearts of the people and build a harmonious society. As for the calculation of wage repayment, according to the country's original Constitution, it is possible to refer to the current Law on State Compensation, regardless of the original position or grade, to a limit of 22 years, based on the average wage base at that time and the living index of rising prices plus interest. We look forward to an early and impartial verdict, and if we do not get a legal solution in the near future, we can only appeal or seek other means of redress. \\nList of complainants attached\\nContact Person Peng Mutao, Tel. 028:8749408\\n15 December 2007\\n"

A large army of five million intellectuals is the talent of the new China, almost all the army wiped out. Woe! Pain! \\nThis evil makes us difficult to friends: how many people are dead and wives separated! How many people are forced to go crazy, cast the river, suicide! How many people were sent to re-education through labour, lost prison, and returned home! How many people are exiled and uprooted! How many people have been tortured maimed and killed! How many people died of artificially starvation for three years! ... it is really sad to see! Even those who are left behind work are demoted, demoted, dismissed, and punished, not reused, get to jump on the altar! Talent waste is great! Loss of work can not be compensated! With the strong ratio, our country does not know a few years behind! If there was no such disaster, China in 22 years would have long been the Premier League of Great Britain and America! Because of our high IQ, strong ability, excellent work, inventor, no shortage of people! \\nAfter the so-called correction, the surviving hard friends in order to take back the lost 22 years of work time, race against time, forfeit the rest, without pay, and work around the clock. Many people have made outstanding achievements and miracles in their work, making outstanding contributions to the motherland and people! Their performance is really touching! You can be amazed, cry devil! Because after my correction, I bought all reports of the right-wing deeds in newspapers and magazines. A drawer has been collected now! \\nIn that year we were: anti-party, anti-socialist, anti-people bourgeois right! I said long ago: 'Today, regardless of whether they turn back or not, corrupt officials at all levels, they really are such people!' They do not listen to the Party's words, embezzled and bribed, dig up the corners of socialism, and ride on the head of the people for good blessing They should die with shame before us! We retired, are two sleeves of breezy! Speak angry...\\nxiǎo\\nAt the age of 84, Chengdu, retired teacher. Back to leisure mulberry Zi, often to 'the old rich heat increase' as the inspiration, set ancient and present Chinese and foreign famelist painting as a night fun. In 1988, the debut 'Qu Yuan-Orange Song Figure' came out, attracted attention to the world. For nearly 18 years, boutique dive out.

A significant proportion of these right-wing elements have direct or indirect links to Beijing's Zhangluo Alliance. \\nQu zijian Zijian, chairman of the NLD Hengyang Municipal Committee, is directly 'linked' to Zhang Bojun and faithfully implement Zhang Bojun's instructions. According to the public's initial representations and Qu zijian Zi-Jian himself, during his participation in the second National Congress of the NLD last February, Zhang Bojun had instructed him: 'Democratic party work cannot go left, left is unfavorable in the international arena, and the right has nothing to do with the right.' Zhang Bojun also said: 'Democratic parties should not mention the assistant of the Communist Party, open their doors to the middle and backward (elements).' Last year, Du Maizhi, a senior general of the Lorongi Group stationed in Hunan and Secretary General of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the NLD, also went to Hengyang City and Qu zijian Zi, instructing his democratic party's main work in the future to capture 'party-non-party relations', 'supervise the party' and 'organize independence and political freedom.' Qu zijian Zijian has always been the leader of the opposition party during his activities on weekdays, threatening that 'cooperation with the Communist Party is not serious'. Although there is no university in Hengyang City, he shouted to 'abolish the party committee system.' He was looking for the party's forks everywhere and written as materials dedicated to Dumai. In the big magnification, he and Wang Huiduan, chairman of the People's Construction Hengyang City Committee Committee, and Yang Xiaolu, member of the Minge Hengyang City Committee, formed small groups of right-wing groups, rampant attacks against the party \\nXiangtan municipal party committee deputy chairman committee, right-wing Gong Yeguang and Zhang Luo Union secretary Wu Jingchao have close ties. Gong Yeguang ignited everywhere during the bloom. He sang Zhang Bojun and Dumai's so-called 'Democratic Party only accept the leadership of the CPC Central Committee' and other tones. He sold Zhang Bojun's fallacy of 'political design institute' and 'finished product' in municipal associations. \\nIt was revealed that Changde City Committee Chairman Liu Wenbing and Ma Shaoqiao, chairman of the NLD branch of Shaoyang City Second Middle School, are right-wing elements with close ties with the Zhangluo Union. People also revealed that Zeng Zhaozhi, head of the Democratic Party of A&M's Shaoyang City Liaison Group, was personally selected by Xu Junhu, head of the organization of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Agricultural and Labour Democratic Party and the right-wing activist Xu Junhu. ...\\n"

				"memoirContent": "[Attachment 2] Nie Shouzhong: My Memories of Mr. Qu zijian Zi-Jian\\nMr. Qu zijian Zijian, a person from Hengyang County, was born on December 18, 1890. Since the death of both parents, dependent on auntie; aspiring to read, 21 years old graduated from Hunan province with honorable grades. Immediately dedicated to education, in Hengzhou Fuzhong and Hunan Province three teachers coached for 11 years. For seven years, he was responsible for teaching administration, and worked hard to cultivate talents for the Shonan region. In particular, Qu zijian Lau met Xia Xi and He Shu-heng as early as 1920. Through their introduction, Mao Zedong met Mao Zedong. In 1921, Mao Zedong was invited twice to give lectures and guide the work, so that the Shonan Education Movement and the Changsha School Movement under Mao Zedong's personal leadership were closely linked to the propagation of the new cultural movement and revolution. Thoughts, and in turn developing the Socialist Youth League in Hengyang and the establishment of Communist Party organizations, have played a very good role  Qu zijian Lao once said that he and Jiang Xiaoqing, He Shu, Huang Jingyuan, Jiang Xianyun and others were the first to join the Socialist Youth League. He joined three teachers in addition to Huang Kecheng, Zhang Jingwu, Wu Yunfu, Zhang Jichun, Zhang Pinghua, Zeng Xisheng, and three female teachers Zhu Shunhua. Li Hanfan, Chengzhang Middle School Liu Tai, Xinmin Middle School Wen Huanran etc. Later this large group of comrades became part of the Shonan Revolution. Strong strength; among them the fastest progress and the most active work is first to be absorbed into the Communist Party, some have been honorly sacrificed for the revolution, some have been closely followed by Mao Zedong, making special contributions during the long journey of the revolution, eventually becoming party and political leaders at all levels in the new China. Qu zijian also told us: in early 1922, Mao Zedong sent Hengshan Daishu people to Hengyang to do organizational work. He introduced Xinmin high school to teach in cover; in May, the Party Central Committee sent Zhang Qiu people to Hengyang to do organizational work, he also introduced them to teach in three teachers. In 1923, around the issue of 'Liu Zhiyuan as the principal of three divisions', the old and new forces in the school formed two major barriers, launched a fierce struggle, and the learning tide continued for more than a month. Although provincial governor Zhao Hengti made a compromise and withdrew Liu Zhiyuan's appointment; however, the revolutionary side also suffered some losses and had to be temporarily transferred underground. In October, Qu zijian Lao and Xie Jin together with Hunan to go to Guangdong. During the Great Revolution, Qu zijian served as a propaganda member of the Political Department of the Second Army of the National Revolutionary Army, teacher representatives of the Second Corps Party, Standing Committee of the Special Military Department and Director of the Political Department of the Central Military Academy Third Branch. It was a brilliant experience before the age of 37. \\nAfter the defeat of the Great Revolution, Qu zijian Lao worked for a long time in Hubei, Jiangsu, Sichuan and other places. Until the outbreak of the anti-Japanese war, the National Communist Party cooperated twice. It was only from Sichuan to return to Hengyang, as one of the founders of the former Xinmin Middle School, and was a mathematics teacher and director of affairs at the school. \\nI know the old, when I became the principal in the spring of 1942. At that time, the school moved to Donghu Town, Taiyuan Temple, Hengyang County, rented Wang, Ling and Liu San Shing Temple as temporary school premises, divided into three hospitals. Qu zijian Lao is an office in a hospital; I am a junior 56 class second grade student, living in the three houses of Liu Memorial, and has two times a week to meet the old, listen to him in 'Citizenship' class. Qu zijian old usually neatly dressed, dignified instrument, wearing 'Napoleon' cap, mention 'freedom stick', a 'gentleman' faction head, prohibitive. He often leaves books and intersperses on other issues, such as 'Sun Yat-sen's Three Policies', 'First Cooperation between the North Warfare and the Communist Party of China'. Therefore, the classmates contacted his education and experience, saying that he was a 'foreigner' or a 'liftist', 'the old Communist Party', with many legendary colors. Qu zijian old school, the first is to focus on a wide range of talents, to enrich the teaching team. Grasp this article, and then, grab the quality of teaching, grasp the building of school style, catch organizational management work, do not flow into rhetoric. Practice proves that the old school idea is completely correct. Originally, Hengyang local folk songs said, 'Chengzheng boots, Daonan umbrella, the new people are delicious and lazy', but Xinmin middle school after hard work, later rose, quickly reversed the social perception and received praise. I also clearly remember: a group of old teachers such as Liu Yihou, Yan Yin, Tang Shaotao, He Dingguo, Tan Chaoru, Yuan Qi, Liu Sanjie, Qu zijian Wenqian, Huang Bingji, Huang Bingheng, Xiao Xin Baizhu, a group of middle-aged rookie such as Huang Zhuoren, Luo Yunpu, Zhang Zhongxuan, Duan Fei, Tan Danchu, Mr. Deng Guangxing, they all learn expertise, excellent business; and educate people, proactive, veteran very respectful, trust them.  At that time, the school had not yet put forward the slogan of 'comprehensive development'. However, the old guiding idea was the main and deputy subjects, opposed to reading dead books, thereby mobilizing the motivation of teachers and students to ensure that the courses such as child training, sports, music, drawings, calligraphy and other courses can be diversified and standardized to be completed according to the plan. Teaching tasks, making school life look vibrant. In terms of children's training courses, the purpose is to train junior high school students how to adapt to wartime life. My class has twice been led by child training teachers to Xidu and Ja Jiang camping, field exercises, probing terrain, tentting, camp, anti-aircraft, lifting stretchers, ambulance wounded, reconnaissance 'enemy posts', standing posts, placing, picnic, camp fire, with nearby schools, rich content, so far very impressed. In short, Qu zijian old people can boil down to 8 words, that love youth, courage to innovate. Xinmin High School published the School Journal for the first time. He boldly let go to the academic unit of the Student Autonomous Association to do the work of organizing and preparing the work. The teacher is only responsible for guidance. The Preamble was written by the old principal Liu Yihou, outlining the history of the school and preserving a valuable historical material for us. A large number of other pages, can be said to be a selection of excellent essay by students; I have four or five in the school journal. The whole school student essay contest, a senior man and I are the rivals. A Jun wrote a word; I learned Liang Ren public pen law, both white and white, to the main fluency. The gentlemen who participated in the review think between us naeberzhong, difficult to differentiate, for this, Qu zijian personally, repeated comparisons, think my article is creative, sharp, very convincing, so I will take the first place. Student autonomy will change, according to the old rules, the post of Permanent Officer (i.e. Chairman), when it comes from the triennial students. Qu zijian old thinks it should be a whole school election. As a result, my two-year two-year student was overwhelmingly pushed as a standing officer through the collegial elections. Three year students disobedience, Qu zijian Lao solemnly instructed the training director any Dingguo to come forward to do a good job. As a Standing Officer, I intend to run evening schools for the people and to strengthen literacy and anti-Japanese propaganda; however, the difficulties faced are the serious underfunding of the activities. It is understood that the reason is that over the years a 'rule' has been formed. 90% of the student membership fee is to be paid to graduating class students a silver graduation medallion, one silver ring, and stationery envelopes. I think that the Student Autonomy will impose dues for the purpose of carrying out student mass activities. It can send some memorial crystals to the graduating class students, but can not be divided and beyond their own load capacity. So, germination of an idea, since my session, changed the silver medallion to copper, cancel the silver ring, and send a little letter envelope. There was considerable resistance at that time, and it was artificial. Through several dialogues and meetings, understanding and support were finally achieved. Qu zijian Lao very much appreciated this, thus giving me a double love. In July 1943, we graduated from 55 classes, 56 classes in Leiyang to attend the provincial examination, we fought for the school. I was 56 class three years 'special treatment' and received the first diploma, approved to sit in our high school without trial. Due to family difficulties, I indicated to Qu zijian that he wanted to go to public schools. Qu zijian Lao expressed understanding and took the initiative to write a letter to Professor Mazungho of the National Teachers College, hoping that he would take care of it when I enrol in the National School of Teachers. For a variety of reasons, I later studied in the province and Guizhou National University, with Qu zijian Lao for seven years, and broke contact with only one letter. \\nIn July 1950, I graduated from university, in order to be an elderly mother, I had to find a job in Hengyang. At this time, I sent a letter to Xinmin's alma mater to inquire about Qu zijian Lao Shortly received a reply to the old, although not many words, but enthusiastic; clearly welcomed me back to my alma mater to host school, ordered me to depart immediately, I returned to Hengyang in October, when Qu zijian was the head of Hengyang city people's Government, was busy; Xinmin middle school in the early liberation years of hard building school, the old school has The problems and contradictions in the personnel aspects of the school are very prominent. After the reorganization, Qu zijian Lao and I are both executive director. He and the principal remain unchanged. Liu Shengyun is the deputy principal. I act as the teaching director and in charge of the Yin letter. In the spring of the second year, the reorganization was again, and Qu zijian continued and the principal, was purely listed; I was deputy principal, presided over the actual work, and began to rectify. Prior to this, Xinmin Middle School in Hengyang City Shaanxi Lane school building the main part of the school property had been sold to the Municipal Power Bureau, saving only part of the land and several houses for the city office. Later the vegetable company to expand, bought the address of the office in the city. I negotiated with Qu zijian old not to spend money; another in Changsheng Road Ma Wang Temple Alley turn to buy a brick structure two-storey building. A portion of the rental to make up the school funds; part of the stay, continue to maintain the city office to provide convenient accommodation for teachers and students to enter the city office. A small number of teachers think that the school sold a house with money and asked for better treatment; this issue, which I explained, had been resolved. Later, one or two teachers visited Qu zijian Lao to reflect the situation. At that time, Qu zijian Lao was no longer working in the municipal government and full-time the chairman of Hengyang Meng, listened to the reaction was unhappy and wanted to get rid of this 'registered' principal of the Xinmin Middle School is a fact; but this is only a 'lead', and the real reason is to take into account: the nature of the NLD. Qu zijianality, task and scope of work, 'mainly in large and medium-sized cities', counties and districts do not develop democratic party organizations, and city and county division, One of my allies stayed in the county and had little influence on the Union. He wanted to try me to give up my new people back to Hengyang City and work with him. In the early days of the founding of the country, private secondary school personnel arrangements, the school council had full autonomy; in terms of the new people, it was the old one with me. At the same time, urban and rural 'through the car', willing to stay, want to walk away, without any formalities. Just as I walked, the new people must have suitable candidates to succeed. At this moment, we coincide with another Xinmin Secondary School alumnus, Mr. Wong Wai On. Xinmin from founding to Mr. Wang Huian succession, this is the seventh restructuring; after this restructuring, the private middle school board has gradually been diluted by people. Qu zijian old has never been to this school again. I leave my new office back to Hengyang City. Although the foreign government work of the Union has changed, but the leaders of the CDU have fallen to the old. Working together, has not been interrupted. Really close to the old and learn more about the old, is these seven years, Qu zijian likes to talk about things, the experience before the age of 37 mentioned above, mostly intermittently talked with me, followed by more talk about the new people, Chuanshan two schools some interpersonal relations. Founded in 1921, 20 years old, only junior high school. Qu zijian Lao succeeds principal, only for the filing of an additional high school. In July and August 1944, Hengyang fell, all schools were forced to shut down, but at this time, the newcomers carried out the third restructuring, leaving office. In February 1945, in order to ease the difficulties of young people seeking school in the affected areas, old in their own home because of poor Jane founded Guanghua secondary school. Named from the school, you can see the place of bitterness and hope. Later, Qu zijian Lao with Qu zijian Fengwu initiated, group County, Chengzhang, Daonan, Xinmin, Guanghua, Jiande six schools run 'Lianzhong', established the 'Lianzhong', Qu zijian Lao is only the general school commissioner, neither the principal nor the director. In 1946, Wei Yekun became the president of Chuanshan School and Hunan Province 'Senate' He is passionate about the provincial 'senatorial' work and hired Qu zijian old generation in the name of 'School Director' to host Funayama School Business. Qu zijian old to Chuanshan, to improve school conditions, and introduce new people to enrich the team of teachers. Less than a year and a half, the board of directors of the school broke out of power because students rushed military training instructors and replaced Wei Yekun's position as principal; then, Qu zijian Lao was also dismissed. \\nIn short, Qu zijian old lived in old China for more than half a century and became fame earlier, but among his peers, there were always people afraid of him, jealous of him, and even fooled him. The underlying reason is that he had organizational relations with the Communist Party in the early years, and his ideological tends to be renewed. Even in the period of cooperation with the Communist Party, he earned a living and employment, rather than a smooth sail, but rather a lot of twists and difficulties. In 1949, Qu zijian Lao has made contact with the underground party, underground alliance. The underground party, he is the chairman of the Union of New Democrats, and he developed more than 20 people to join the membership; at the same time instigated Mayor Yang Xiaolu, Senate Wang Jiwu, and police chief Hu Du uprising. In late May this year, the Hunan provincial branch of the NLD appointed Qin Benjie and Chiang Kai-qing to expand the Hengyang underground alliance group into a direct division. From December 1948 to October 1949, Hengyang has 22 underground allies, 29 people in the alliance's peripheral relations, this is a considerable force, on the eve of liberation, with the underground party to do a lot of work. On October 8, 1949, Hengyang liberation, Qu zijian participated in Hengyang City Military Control Commission Cultural and Educational Takeover Office leadership, immediately became the first head of the municipal people's Government. At this time Qu zijian old just entered the year of flower, the spirit is particularly uplifting. I returned to Hengyang at the beginning, and as far as I saw and heard, his old students and colleagues went to the door to the old school to seek advice. There are also several private schools to be honorary principals or chairman of the board. The NLD has been organized and elected municipal leadership since September 1951. Qu zijian Lao was elected for four consecutive terms as the chairman of the League Municipal Committee; since 1952, two consecutive terms were elected members of the League Provincial Committee; since 1954, two consecutive elected municipal people's deputies and municipal council members; in addition, the provincial people's congress deputies, one session of the Standing Committee of the municipal CPPCC, one vice chairman of the municipal CPPCC. With regard to the work of the Union, first I have my expertise in the Union organs, and then Tang Baotian; Xiao Guanglin, Li Haipeng, etc., in the Union organs, are the old and competent assistants. Qu zijian old lead by example, diligent, adhere to the commuting system, collective consultation. We have negotiated well, and then hold the municipal committee plenary committee to further study and reach a consensus. Only below goes to the grass-roots level to implement it. Always adhere to a fundamental principle: insist on the vertical leadership of the Union Central Committee to the provincial committee, and at the same time adhere to the specific leadership of the party committee at the local level. There is no loss of political direction, let alone there is no resistance to the same party chambers. At that time, the work of the Union was relatively wide, and the work was relatively solid. For example: Communist Party member Jiang Xun first crossed into the Union and participated in the leadership of the League Municipal Committee. He later became the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, based on the counterpart relationship of the work unit, often came to the Union organs to exchange views and study the situation. In all cases of inspection and municipal public teaching activities, we are committed to working closely with it. Top figures in the business and industry, such as Wang Huiduan and Qi Xianglin, are all allied members. Later, they have cross-joined the Civil Construction and Federation of Industry and Commerce, respectively. In order to do their job, they often 'return home' and ask for advice to the old. Medical celebrities such as Wu Zhixiang, Wang Jingnong, He Xiaoxun, Ouyang Zhenchuan, Yi Hanzhang, Liu Jiguang, etc. Some of them participate part-time in the leadership of the League Municipal Committee, some are active at the grassroots level. We have made a certain contribution to the establishment of the Chinese Hospital and the Democratic Party of Agriculture and Labour. As for cultural and educational work, according to the League's Charter, this is the focus of the work of the League. In the early days of liberation, from below the Director of Education and Education, the city's primary and secondary school principals, teaching directors, teaching and research team leaders, allied members and cross-comrades of the Party (Communist Party), Union (Communist Party), Union (Communist Party), League have a majority. Mobilizing members, uniting teachers, running a good school and achieving great results. In the early 50s, social movements and centers worked more. In order to help the members and the masses to whom the Union contacted, the Union organs have held various symposia by sector. These colloquiums, usually presided over by the old, I summarize; or I preside, the old summary, very serious. Before the meeting of the NPC and the CPPCC, the Union organs also invited members, including Wang Huiduan and Qi Xianglin, who served as deputies and members, to come back to organize proposals on the central topic of the conference and to improve the level of participation in politics and politics. I remember doing the Chinese hospital and cremation field, which was the old initiative. Looking at these work historically, it is no exaggeration to say that it was one of the most successful golden times in the history of Hengyang League. Of course, the old is not perfect. He makes friends widely, and even 'do not read old evil', 'from good as flow', but it is not decisive enough. People are old, but also consider such personal issues. \\nIn 1956, he went to Beijing for a trip. Minister Li Weihan warmly received and arranged for the old CPPCC. Qu zijian Lao met General Huang Kecheng and Vice Premier Li Fuchun. At that time, Zhang Jingwu, First Secretary of the Tibetan Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, returned to Beijing for debriefing, took Qu zijian old to Yuquan Mountain, and her wife personally cooked, and engaged Hunan hometown food hospitality. When the CPPCC left Beijing, the CPPCC sent a lot of gifts; Zhang Jingwu also told Zhang Pinghua, then secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), 'took the wind' in Wuhan. Qu zijian Lao's trip, deeply felt that party and government leaders at all levels of the Communist Party at all levels attached great importance to revolutionary friendship and teacher and student feelings. He was very happy. After the balance, he had arranged a feast at the restaurant to thank the Comrades of the Union organs and talked about their feelings. However, shortly thereafter, some leaders of the municipal leadership organization Democratic Party approved 'individualism', whose prospect was targeted at the old, but he himself was in the drum. \\n1957 against the right, in June, first concentrated fire, with me as the main attack break; and then Luoweaving criticized the old, even in the old society's personal life some hidden hidden, also captured the wind and moved out, defeated me and the old, including alternate members of the League municipal committee leaders including alternate members have fallen by Jiang Xun, Pi heart Xuan, Xiao Guanglin, Wang Jingnong, Li Haipeng, Zhou Ji and others; Wang Chenmuyinxian a year Founded as 'Hufeng elements' and insufficient evidence of guilt, it was only liberated, this time not in the 'robbery'. Since then, the leadership of the League Municipal Committee was replaced by Chen Shii-sen and others. \\nI got the party implemented the policy in April 1979. \\nIn November 1980, through the election of the seventh member assembly in Hengyang city, returned to the League Municipal Committee leadership positions, immediately publicly called for Qu zijian Lao Ping to be wrong and wrong. Since then, Qu zijian Lao wrote seven letters to me in a row. The letter of 11 June 1981 is reproduced: 'The Central Inspection Unit has arrived in Changsha, and I have made a report. Recently, the province appointed several groups to inspect the counties and cities; Provincial Committee United Front Minister Din Vik led a group to Hengchen. Yesterday I went to the provincial CPPCC, and the comrade in charge wrote the material on my behalf, and could be corrected in the future. Close-up trusts you for me to do my best to help solve. Before and after liberation, I work in Hengyang, you know. The underground party made me chair of the Union of New Democrats, and I developed more than 20 people to join... from the day of liberation until 1957, I did a series of work. Leaders of successive municipal committees and municipal governments Mao Yuanyao, Zhang Shijie, Chen Weiqing, Yang Xingzhou and Wang Qingshan are very good with me. I believe that something can be done until they talk about housing. I know that party leaders are strong, united and comprehensive, and must accept their leadership in doing work. 1956 Chapter new secretary, it is difficult to meet. He used one of the faculty members in one of the city's two classes to serve as vice-principals of the four schools. The masses had views In 1957, I spoke 'only party sectarianism'. This is an opinion. It is by no means anti-party anti-socialism. Who is expected to be classified as right-wing? Now ramie seek, should be corrected early...\\nIn a letter dated 10 September 1981, I was informed: 'A notice has been received to correct the mistakes and, since October 1978, the 13 salary was repaid. A comfortable mood, very sense that the party leadership is great right, there must be mistaken, realistic.' Not yet, said to better live a good life in old age, told me to tell my fellow friends in Hengshi. Later Hengyang City took care of Qu zijian old, in Xiaojiashan gave him a house. But Qu zijian old children and their loved ones live in Changheng two places, he lives in Changsha, misses Hengyang; returned to Hengyang, and wanted to Changsha. The year of wind candlesticks, moving back, it's hard. I visited him three times before and after, and never could help him resolve this contradiction. On September 1, 1983 at 4:35 p.m., Qu zijian old finished a twisting path of life, died in Changsha, at the age of 93. I received a telegram of death, and immediately went to Changsha to attend the mourning. Since Qu zijian Lao has served as a provincial librarian and history librarian and a member of the provincial staff office since the 60s. Therefore, the mourning work was co-chaired by the Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, the Provincial Democratic Union, the Provincial History Museum, the Provincial Counsellor and the United Front Work Department of the Provincial Committee. Central Committee leading comrades Li Weihan, Huang Kecheng, Jiang Hua and Zhang Pinghua sent messages of condolence respectively. September 9 in the provincial CPPCC auditorium held a solemn memorial conference, everyone 'with a very sad mood, to mourn this Comrades who have fought side by side with us and have worked with us for a long time, and express their cordial condolences to his family'. After the memorial service, the old ashes were placed in the tomb of revolutionary martyrs in Changsha City. Qu zijian Lao left us, 14 years have passed, and this year coincides with the 40th anniversary of the anti-right struggle. I write this article, standing on the student's stand and work with teachers for a long time. By relying on mourning! (Author Department of Hengyang Shijiyuan retired cadres)\\nPAGE\\nPAGE 1"

				"memoirContent": "[Attached] Tan chengyuan: 'The Truth of the Counterrevolutionary Incident of Sichuan Agricultural College in 1957' ('Past Signs' 15, January 25, 2009)\\nThe anti-right movement of 1957 has elapsed 51 years now. I, who was characterized as a 'Sichuan Agricultural College's Anti-Revolution Incident Case', also became a seventy old man from the hot blood young people of that year. No matter how times change, 1957 will always be a year for me. We never forget that teachers and students who have been expelled, re-education through labour and re-education through labour, many of them have been tortured for this purpose. \\nIn June 1956, the leaders of the Agronomy College of Sichuan University conveyed to the entire college teachers and students of the Sichuan Provincial People's Government and the Higher Education Bureau of Sichuan Province, according to the State Council and the Ministry of State Education in college adjustment, decided to adjust the agricultural college of the former Sichuan University, and set up a Sichuan Agricultural College in Ya'an city. Yuanchuan University's three faculty and students of agronomy, animal husbandry, forestry, went to Ya'an Sichuan Agricultural College in August. After the documents were communicated, teachers and students believed that they were subjective, bureaucratic and unrealistic wrong decisions, with serious resistance. But in August, everyone said goodbye to Chuan University came to the new Sichuan Agricultural College in Ya'an and began a new semester of study. \\nThis came to the 1957 winds movement. Teachers and students were encouraged by Mao Zedong's speech. In addition to seeing the People's Daily published a number of editorials and a lot of reports on the wind, the remote Sichuan Agricultural College is lagging behind the development of the situation! In early April, Yang Xuxian, a student from the Department of Agronomy, and others, posted the first big print on the campus, 'Why did the Provincial Higher Education Bureau not seek and hear the opinions of experts and teachers and students from the institute, and arbitrarily decided to relocate Sichuan Agricultural College'. The publication of this big print newspaper immediately caused a huge response and resonance from the entire college's teachers and students. The large print newspaper on the 'relocation of hospital' opinions is full of eyes. Scientifically demonstrated that Ya'an region, due to its location along the basin, too much rain, insufficient sunlight, is not representative of crop cultivation and seed cultivation in Sichuan. Some newspapers criticized the Sichuan Rural Rehousing Institute as a serious bureaucratic and subjective subjective leader of the Higher Education Bureau. The product of righteousness; teachers cited the variability and degradation of wheat seeds transplanted from Chengdu to Ya'an, and the relocation to Ya'an The fact that the yield of dairy breed dairy dairy dairy has declined, suggests that Ya'an region is not suitable for agricultural college construction. The request to correct the mistakes of the relocation of Sichuan farmers became the consensus of the whole hospital teachers and students. \\nDaitazu newspapers and forums have been set up in all faculties and grades. At that time, there were 'weathery and rain, six pedestrian walks' of the Department of Agriculture; 'hedgehog', 'cattle fly' of the Department of Animal Husbandry; and the Department of Forestry's 'Action' Editorial Department. 'Action' editorial department is our only big print newspaper in Lin's second grade. It consists of Zhu Bohua, Yin Huajie, Zhang Kewen, Xu Kongzhao, Huang Dingguo and I co-sponsored the composition. The aim is to gather the opinions of all grade students. We have written a lot of large print newspapers, all around the relocation of the hospital against the 'three major principles'. I wrote and signed two articles: one entitled 'Feudalism is the root of the three major theories' and the other entitled 'The relocation of Sichuan Agricultural College is the provincial Higher Education Bureau that does not respect science, does not respect public opinion, and is a gross violation of democratic centralism.' In addition, I made a statement at the academy committee cadres, saying that my country should draw on the lessons of the Soviet Union and resolutely oppose personal worship in political life and oppose the dehumanization of individuals. For 'there is never a savior, nor an immortal emperor, to create the happiness of humanity, it is our own.' \\nThe contents of the Sichuan Agricultural College Ming Enlarged Newspaper gradually relate to: carrying out the 5.4 spirit, to be democratic and free; China's electoral system is imperfect and the degree of democracy is not enough; the people are not guilty, but lies, in reality, language crimes, and text jails still exist. At this time, Liu Tianjuan, Chairman of the Student Union, and Yang Xuxian, Li Depei of the Department of Agriculture, Zhao Binchang and Wang Shulun from the Department of Animal Husbandry jointly initiated to form a 'joint editorial department', referred to as 'co-editor', to discuss to their superiors the views on relocation. Immediately after the establishment of the 'Joint Editor', and the Student Union jointly drafted a letter from Sichuan Agricultural College to the State Council. In order to make the letter more representative, the letter was also posted in front of the auditorium, accompanied by a register of signatures. More than 95 per cent of the faculty and students of the entire hospital signed their endorsement and strong support in less than a day. \\nIn mid-May 1957, Professor Yang Zhinong, head of the Department of Agronomy (head of Ya'an Municipal Union), spoke at a symposium organized by Ya'an Land Committee and Ya'an Municipal Committee, expressing his views on the 'relocation' of Sichuan farmers. In late May, at a symposium held by the United Front Department of Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Professor Yang Zhinong and Professor Xia Dingyou of the Department of Animal Husbandry (animal husbandry expert in the United States in 1953, relinquishing high salaries in the United States and returning to the country to participate in socialist construction), together reflected in Chuanchuan teachers and students for the 'relocation' 'Hospital' views. There is no indication from the relevant authorities that they still take a bureaucratic attitude towards the opinions of the masses in the middle of the wind. \\nIn late May, a letter from Shanghai Jiaotong University was posted in the college's big print newspaper. This letter was written to her by a female student in the Department of Animal Husbandry and posted it after she looked. The letter wrote: 'Shanghai Jiaotong University originally decided to relocate to Xi'an in accordance with the spirit of adjustment of the faculties of the Ministry of Education. However, by resistance and dissent from the masters and students, they reflected their opinions directly to the State Council. Finally, taking into account the voices of the masses, Prime Minister Zhou personally coordinated, saying that the decision to move will not be carried out until the investigation and study. Teachers and students saw this letter, outraged, and immediately set off a big wave in the college. Because, in early May, the College Student Union reflected the views of the majority of teachers and students on the 'relocation' to the State Council, so far there is no audio. Shanghai Jiaotong University and Sichuan Nong are colleges and universities, have the same situation, but the State Council treats the same way? So, the snowflakes and slogans were quickly filled with the whole house. 'Ask the State Council why the same colleges are treated differently', 'Jiaotong University is as heavy as Taishan, the Agricultural Institute is a hongmao', 'resolutely opposes the wrong view of heavy industry and agriculture under the State Council and asked the student union to send representatives to Rong to petition' and 'power to the State Council.' These calls became the focus and common topic of the whole house. Because the emotions of the classmates are difficult to control, there is no mind to continue the class again. So there was a big print that called for the CPC Committee and Administration to suspend classes, and received a warm response from everyone. Some classes in the veterinary department of animal husbandry are closed first, with each department also closed. \\nAt the request of many public opinion, finally by the Student Union and the 'Union' joint initiative: a 'delegation of Sichuan Agricultural College students' composed of representatives of students elected by various departments, went to Rong and appealed to Rong, to the provincial committee, provincial government and the Higher Education Bureau directly reflect the views of teachers and students of the whole college on 'relocation'. The initiative was quickly embraced and supported by all. Therefore, according to the number of students, selected by the students, the 'Delegation to Rong' was set up. The head of the team was Liu Tianjuan (Department of Agronomy), Chairman of the Student Union, with three members: Wan Jiagui, Yang Xuxian, Li Depei; Animal Husbandry: Shi Chengqi, Zhao Binchang, Wang Shulun; Lin Xue Department two: Tan chengyuan, Liu Songkang, a total of 9. \\nAfter the delegation was established, on the morning of June 14, 1957, Yang Xuxian, Wan Jiagui, Liu Songkang and other students came to Ya'an City Hebei Street Coach Station, buy tickets to Rong. I don't know that the ticket sales clerks see the students' chest emblem said: 'With instructions from the superior, not to sell tickets to Chuanong students.' After repeated explanations and arguments from the students, the station still refused to sell tickets. Under this situation, Wanjiaguei students returned to school and told the students who were studying themselves, and we heard very angry. Immediately gathered more than 20 classmates to arrive at the station with the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, asking why they didn't sell tickets? There was a dispute between the two sides. The station ticket office did not know from there 'gathered' a lot of 'masses' to criticize the classmates: 'just do not sell tickets to Chuanong students.' 'As long as you dare to leave Ya'an one step, you will break your legs.' Students shouted 'Long live the Constitution of the People's Republic of China!' Facing each other for about 20 minutes, the station chief asked superiors to agree to sell tickets to us. Back to the college, the students knew what happened when purchasing tickets were angry and there was a lot of discussion. As the delegation is about to visit Rong the next day, for the last time, for the last time, an entire college student conference was held in front of the auditorium in the big print house in front of the auditorium. When the student union chairman Liu Tianjuan was preparing to speak on stage, suddenly a classmate from the Department of Animal Husbandry came to stage, snatched the microphone shouting to the classmates: 'Please note the students, please pay attention to the classmates! Now, there is a mix of off-campus staff in the crowd, ask the classmates to organize the team on class and ask the casual people to leave the venue.' Then the entire team found that there was indeed a mix of men and women of unknown origin among the crowd. Upon enquiry, it was known that Sun Defu (male, deputy secretary of the LCC), and Huang Zhen (female, propaganda officer), of the Ya'an Land Committee Working Group. Due to the difficulties of purchasing tickets and being besieged, some classmates seem emotionally excited and have asked why they are not really bright and sneaky in the crowd? After coming to the venue, Zhao Guangrong, secretary of the House Party Committee, confirmed that the two were indeed comrades of the Working Group of the Land Committee Liu Tianjuan asked them to take a break at the office of the Student Union, before reporting and exchanging views to them after the congress. Then the congress continued, Liu Tianjuan read to everyone the 'written material to reflect the situation to the Provincial Committee, the Provincial Government and the Higher Education Bureau', which was unanimously approved by the students by warm applause. The conference ended at 10 p.m. \\nHe did not know that later when they struggled the right wing, the classmates were slanted for 'besieging stations for counter-revolutionary propaganda'; invited the local committee working group to rest at the office for a temporary break and was rendered slandered as 'illegal interrogation of the local committee working group, from 11:00 p.m. on the 16th, until 2:00 a.m.' He was characterized as a 'Sichuan Agricultural College Counterrevolutionary Incident Case'. It was really inconceivable, intentional and poisonous. He wanted to add sin. \\nThe next morning, nine people from our student delegation, escorted by Zhao Guangrong, party secretary of the hospital, came to Ya'an bus station. Although they were angry by the 'masses', they finally arrived in Chengdu safely. In Chengdu, we were warmly welcomed by the students of Chuan University and lived in the Chuan University Student Association and received their understanding and support. \\nOn the day after the delegation arrived in Rong, we went to the Sichuan Provincial Committee in Commercial Street, and the Sichuan Provincial People's Government at Supervisor Street, respectively, to see Governor Li Dazhang. The governor avoided, we submitted the Submission to the General Office of the Provincial Government and the Provincial Committee Office. In the afternoon, all members went to the Sichuan Provincial Higher Education Bureau to attend a symposium chaired by Director Cornell. At the meeting, we reflected the views of all faculty and students on the relocation and pleaded the Higher Education Bureau to investigate the decision again. \\nOn June 18, we are preparing to return to school at 11:00 a.m. A student who called himself Chuanong looked for us. Shi Chengqi from the Department of Animal Husbandry knows that he is Pang Anben, the first grader of animal husbandry. He was 19 years old. He grew up in an orphanage since childhood in Jiangjin County, Sichuan. He was sent to junior high school because of wisdom, and then admitted to the Department of Animal Husbandry. We saw him languishing and tired, wearing only one shoe on his feet and barefoot. See us, cry. After a little calm, I cry about the events that took place in the Academy on 17 June, after the delegation left Ya'an. \\nAccording to him, at noon on June 17, many 'masses' were gathered at the entrance of the college, claiming to go to school to watch the big print. After being refused by the doorman, many people forcibly rushed into the school door, and even people crossed the college wall. See this situation, livestock student Liu Jia-xiang came forward. Call on everyone to form a nursing team to help guard workers to maintain order and protect the safety of the college. At this time, the more the 'masses' outside the school entrance gather, some of them are organ cadres attire, some appear to be workers dressed in labor protection uniforms, and farmers carrying flat burdens from afar, and even small vendors. These 'masses', struggled to impact the college gate, smashed the door lock forcefully pushed away, stormed into the campus. The students who are studying themselves and watching the big print are unprepared. They only saw that they ran all the way out of the school shouting the slogan 'pulling the reactionary students out', and saw the big print newspaper tear. Seeing the classmates caught pushing and shoving, ordering them to hand over the reactionary students who had trouble. Many students were beaten and scared to run around. Many girls are scared to hide under the bed tears straight. As a result of the large number of outsiders entering the school, the campus facilities were destroyed and overwhelmed. The beautiful garden has been razed to the ground, a desolation. Peng Anben said that out of indignation, he quietly took off the emblem and fled the college towards Chengdu and told our delegation that it was aware of. He has 147 kilometers from Ya'an to Chengdu, with no money, hunger and thirst and run to the 'Golden Rooster', a shoe has been rotten, had to walk with one foot, it was hard to stop a truck to seek, the driver agreed to let him ride to Chengdu. \\nWe listened to a cry from Pang Anben, and an outrage filled with indignation. Everyone unanimously suggested that this serious incident must be reported to the provincial committee and the provincial government in an urgent manner, in order to find a just solution. Otherwise, where is the Axiom? Where is democracy? According to Peng Anben's remarks, I and I immediately wrote an article entitled 'Our Cry Complaints'. Members of the delegation reported to the provincial committee and provincial government respectively, and distributed to students in various universities and universities in Chengdu. \\nOn June 20, 1957, a delegation of 10 people (plus Peng Anben), returned to the College in a nervous mood. Just crossed into the college gate, I suddenly felt an ominous serenity. There is a red cloth banner hanging above the school door, which says 'Warmly welcome the working group of the Communist Party of Ya'an and the Land Committee to guide the wind movement.' A counter to the past passion noise, the whole campus quietly silent, all big print newspapers have long been lost. We return to our classes and see the students infinite frustration and melancholy. For the 'masses' go to school, it seems like a nightmare that never happened. \\nAt that time, the college has resumed classes, and the final examination is not far away, and everyone strives for good results. At the end of the exam, our Forestry students thought they were going to be internship in Emeishan. Other graders look forward to returning home with their loved ones. Suddenly, the College issued a notice: 'According to the decision of the Party Committee and the College's administrative research, students and staff are not allowed to leave school without permission this summer, and uniformly carry out political studies according to the arrangement of the parent party committee.' Each department then conducted a full day study under the leadership of the House Party Committee. First, learn 'People's Daily' June 8 editorial 'Why is this?' And 'To have positive criticism, there must also be correct 'anti-criticism', 'workers speak' and so on, on June 19, published the 'Problems of Correct Handling of People's Internal Contradictions', and repeatedly learn the six criteria added therein to distinguish fragrant flowers and poisons. \\nIt's probably the late June morning, when I went to the morning practice through the big print house, I saw everyone watching a new big print. The title is: 'Unveiling the leather of the so-called Komsomol members, please see Yang Xuxian's performance in the whole wind movement.' To accuse Yang Xuxian, in the name of helping the Party to rectify, organizing and holding the large print newspaper of the Department of Agronomy, wrote several articles, viciously assaulted the Party's intellectuals and literary policies, and stigmatized the Party's political movements and shouted for the counter-revolutionaries. Named a group of defenders of truth in the Department of Agronomy. \\nImmediately afterwards, the 'Yang Xuxian Planning Organization 'Joint Editorial Department' is named after the relocation of the hospital, the control college sounded public opinion, launched an order for the carrier to attack the party, 'Please see Yang Xuxian who is also a filial son of the landlord class, and rampant anti-socialism is his class. Great Exposure of Sex. At the same time, a large print was posted on the criticizing Student Union President Liu Tianyuan: 'Liu Tianjuan relies on the post of President of the Student Union to hold the student union and play a shameful lead role in the relocation of the hospital', 'The delegation to Rong is Liu Tianjuan and Yang Xuxian deceived the entire college teacher and students. Draw the anti-party conspiracy. The Department of Animal Husbandry has also published large print papers criticizing Li Depei, Wan Jiagui, Wang Shulun, Zhao Binchang and others. Surrounded by a critic crusade full of gunpowder, the Academy has been washed and cleaned up to clean the big print, re-covered by the big print that exposes the critical right-wing. \\nAfter the Sichuan Daily named Professor Yang Zhinong, head of the Department of Critical Agronomy, the school immediately launched a critical struggle against Yang Zhinong and Xia Dingyou. said, 'Yang Zhinong is the overall backstage of the 'move to the hospital' of the Sichuan NLD. 'The speech at the ringing ceremony of the Sichuan NLD is a kind of anti-socialist meadow grass.' He said hard that the relocation of the Sichuan Agricultural College was a pilot in Ya'an by Pan Dakui, Sichuan, and asked Yang Zhinong to deal with the NLD Pan Dakui and Zhao Yi Relations between the people; said Xia Dingyou instigated students' troubles, advocating that laymen could not lead the leadership of the internal opposition party. Every effort is made to far-fetch the students of Sichuan Agricultural College to contact Yang Zhinong, and then linked to Sichuan NLD Pan Dakui and NLD Central Zhangluo Union. In this way, not only was it a 'counter-revolutionary crime', but also had more than 20 right-wing elements being pulled out among the teachers. \\nOn July 3, 1957, an eye-catching big print newspaper was printed in the eyes: 'Took Tan chengyuan, the backbone of the delegation to Rong to show the public.' Since then, I have been fighting critically for more than half a month in a row and at the level. Impose me the following unwarranted charges: rampant opposition to the socialist system and nonsense that the decision to move to the hospital is a brutal violation of democracy; in the name of opposing personal worship, attacking the great leader Mao Chairman Mao; slandering the masses in school is a planned and organized crackdown on students by the Ya'an Land Commission. The members of our delegation to Rong, including Peng Anben, are all classified as right-wing elements, and none was spared. The anti-right storm of Sichuan Agricultural College continued until the end of August. \\nOn October 30, 1957, Party branch secretary Xiong Zhicheng informed me that I no longer attend classes, went to the party committee organization department to meet and accept punishment. To the Office of the Organization Department, I see Wang Shulun from the Department of Agriculture and Livestock Department have been present. Minister Zhang asked us three people to sit down, and then pick up the documents that have been prepared, according to the Xankedi said: by the CPC Committee of the Committee of the Academy and submitted the approval of the anti-right leadership group of the Ya'an Land Committee, now to organize and deal with you:\\nWang Shulun, male, 20 years old, Jiangjin County, Sichuan province, family composition rich farmers. In the autumn of 1956, enrolled in the second grade of animal medicine, Department of Animal Husbandry, Sichuan Agricultural College. In the 1957 party's rectification movement, the student, with carved class hatred, published several articles of anti-party anti-socialist poisons in its 'cattle fly' reactionary organization. In the so-called 'delegation to Rong' petitions, he was the core backbone, and now decided to dismiss him from school and send re-education through labour sanctions \\nWan Jia you, male, 21 years old, Sichuan Chengdu, family landlords. In the autumn of 1954, enrolled in the fourth grade of Agronomy Department of Sichuan Agricultural College. The student was in the 1957 party's rectified movement, with a carved class hatred, taking advantage of the opportunity of relocating to the Sichuan Agricultural College, rampant attacking the Party. He had published a number of poisonous herbs that attacked the Party's policy policy and policy, openly shouting that 'the life of farmers after liberation is not better to work for landlords'. The student was a core backbone in the petition of the delegation to Rong, and now decided to dismiss him from school and send correctional action through labour. \\nTan chengyuan, male, 18 years old, Chengdu city, family composition reactionary officer. In autumn 1955, enrolled in the third grade of forest management, Department of Forestry, Sichuan Agricultural College. In the 1957 party's rectified movement, the student, with carved class hatred, took the opportunity to relocate the Sichuan Agricultural College and rampant to attack the Party. In the resignation, he made a speech 'from the lessons of the 20 congresses of the Soviet Communist Party, to see the danger of personal worship', with a sandy insinuation attacking the great leader Chairman Mao; and called cluttered the case by anti-revolutionaries. The student was a backbone in the petition of the delegation to Rong, and now decided to dismiss him from school and send correctional action through labour. \\nAfter the processing documents were read out, the staff of the hospital's protection section immediately removed three of us from school and sent to Ya'an City Public Security Bureau shelter. I silently said goodbye to campus, my alumni, and since then, to a long road to re-education through labour. \\nThe relentless passage of time. Half a century later, I was forced to get together with Liao Chengzhong, Zhu Bohua, Yin Huajie, Yue Weifu, He Yunsheng, and so on. The former are satisfied with the spirit, the bloody youth, has long been the years of the wind knife frost sword, bloody wind etched into a full face. It was only learned from the conversation that since I was first disposed of quietly leaving school, the college dealt with the qualified right-wing elements. Firstly, the relocation of the College was characterized as a 'Anti-Revolution Incident of Sichuan Agricultural College'. The key elements such as Yang Zhinong, Professor Xia Dingyou and Chairman of the Student Union Liu Tianjuan (Department of Agronomy), Liu Jiahang (Head of the Guardian Team), Zhao Binchang (Animal Husbandry Department), put on anti-revolutionary hat in Ya'an The city held a public sentencing meeting to be sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison respectively; Liu Shing Chung and Ho Yunsheng were expelled from school. Deportation to their place of origin; for Zhu Bohua, Yin Huajie, Yue Weifu students to dismiss their education and stay in school. Other right-wing elements were subjected to re-education through labour or dismissal, or by staying in school for inspection. \\nIn 2007, I obtained a summary summary of the work of right-wing elements from the Sichuan Agricultural University's organizational department. The minutes write:\\n(1), In 1957, in the fight against the right, a total of 85 right-wing elements. Of these students 56; faculty and staff 29 (3 professors, 4 lecturers, 11 assistants, 4 auxiliary, 2 provincial management cadres, 5 cadres). \\n(2), 128 persons designated as middle and right elements. Of these, 1 teacher and 127 students. \\n(3), 28 designated reactionary organizations. Participating personnel 257 people. \\n(4), The review of the above-mentioned right-wing elements is a miscalculation and all corrected. \\n(5), In 1957, teachers and students had opinions on the relocation of Sichuan Agricultural College, because the issue of relocation was identified as a 'counter-revolutionary insurgent case'. After review, it was reported to the Provincial Land Committee and the court for approval. It was a wrong case, corrected by mistake; for the arrest and sentencing of Yang Zhinong, Xia Dingyou, Liu Tianjuan, Liu Jiahang, Yang Xuxian, Li Depei, Zhao Binchang 7, quashed the sentence, acquitted, restored political honor to implement the relevant policies. \\nAt this point, the so-called 'Sichuan Agricultural College Counterrevolutionary Incident' that had shocked the whole country and stirred Sichuan, finally came to an end. However, Professor Yang Zhinong has long died in Miaoxi Labour Farm Prison; Professor Xia Dingyou died shortly after his return to the Sichuan Agricultural College after his return to the Sichuan Agricultural College. The whereabouts of innocent sentenced students still remain unknown. How many of the more than 200 teachers and students of the College were killed? How many wives have been dispersed? How many relatives have been discriminated against? It reflects the despicable and cruel nature of a totalitarian regime that violates freedom, democracy and human rights. \\nHowever, Deng Xiaoping, the general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the anti-right leadership group of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, concluded in the form of a resolution of the Party at the Sixth Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, 'is completely correct and necessary. However, the fight against the right has been greatly expanded, misdesignating a group of intellectuals, patriots and party cadres as right-wing elements, with unfortunate consequences'. We cannot help but ask: since more than 99% of the right-wing elements are misguided, is it necessary to launch an anti-right movement? Since more than 99% of the right-wing elements are misguided, is the anti-right movement correct? \\nThe right-wing elements who had been subjected to political persecution had been rectified but were incarcerated innocent through re-education through labour, without compensation for property, financial or moral compensation. They got only three words-looking forward. \\nIn this painful history, people are asked to 'amnesia', 'aphasia,' not to restore the true face of history and to let future generations know the suffering and suffering of their fathers in pursuit of the truth. If this is the case, how can the grievances of the poor friends of the right rest in peace! \\nPAGE 13"

At the beginning of the anti-right struggle, Tan hanchuan immediately appeared in the general court with a gesture of 'progress' and the 'left' face. When Chen Renbing, the right-wing activist, was exposed, Tan hanchuan tried to push all his crimes to others in order to clear himself. When Shen Zhiyuan was revealed, he also attempted to exert two-sided tactics and confuse it. \\nThe struggle has deepened, Tan hanchuan had to sign up for inspection. But he dressed himself as a middleman. After more than a month's small meeting and the revelation and rebuttal of three extended colloquiums, the Tan hanchuan right was exposed and had to admit that it was a shameful two-sided faction. \\nAccording to reports, Tan hanchuan and Chen Renbing jointly planned and organized five symposiums on the film, and was one of the masterminds. The anti-party symposium was held on the basis of Tan hanchuan's proposal. This spring, Tan hanchuan was one of the planners and organizers of the Xuhui District CPPCC incident created by right-wing elements. \\nDuring the great magnification period, Tan hanchuan set fire all around to attack the Party. In the short 11 days of May, he not only conspired with Sun Siming to attack the Xuhui District incident, but also directed cadres to set fire to secondary professional schools, personally to many grass-roots organizations such as New Knowledge Publishing House, Choir, etc., to instigate, dark. Members can attack the party on issues such as personnel, rebellion, and salary reform. He also wrote a reactionary article on 'Leader's prestige', published in Wen Wei Bao. \\nIn the course of the vicious development of the NLD, Tan hanchuan has always adhered to the principle of 'opening the door to backwardness', requiring everyone to not have to ask the question of the political history of the target of development during the development process. \\nOn the correct policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision proposed by the Party, Tan hanchuan has spread Shen Zhiyuan's so-called 'prior supervision theory' and also absurd 'play'.

				"memoirContent": "【Attached 1】Qian jiaxie Jia-Sip: 'Northeastern Renmin University Anti-Right History' (manuscript)\\nIn February and March 1957, President Mao Zedong made a speech at the Supreme State Council on 'Correct Handling the Problems of People's Intra-Contradictions' (important changes made in the press during the anti-right movement), and then addressed a national propaganda workshop. Talking about preparing for the wind, and proposed to implement the policy of 'one hundred family contests, flowers all together' in the ideological and cultural work: 'speak without words, endless words, no sinful speakers, shame.' Northeastern People's University (formerly known as Jilin University), by Lord Du Ruo, the Department of Law, who attended the two sessions in Beijing, delivered the report. Most teachers and students throughout the school rejoice, and some say, 'Spring is coming. There are also people complained: plug foreign spring late.' \\nThe most famous student of the Northeastern region\\nHu Xianzhong, a fourth grade student in the Department of Economics, joined the Communist Party of the Communist Party of China (CCP), on the eve of liberation when he studied secondary school in At that time, he was also influenced by Hu Feng's literary and artistic ideas, and the school was censorship for this. On three occasions, the Hu Feng incident was used by the People's Daily to disclose a large amount of material in several full-page pages, reflecting high-level intentions is obvious. Campus due to the Hufeng incident, touched a lot of people, most reluctant to mention this matter ①. On June 8 of that year, the People's Daily published 'Why Is This?' The editorial, the wind direction changes have been very clear. In late June, Hu Xianzhong published 'Is Hu Feng et al. Counterrevolution?' in the Journal of the Northeastern People's Congress Such an anachronistic article. Later under pressure, Hu Xianzhong sent another article 'On Hu Feng Problem'. Conditional acknowledgement that Hu Feng was counter-revolutionary, but the blame for the Hufeng case could not be washed off. \\nI worked in the Philosophy Department and studied in the same class in the Department of Economics and Hu Xianzhong. Understand this person has strong writing skills, but also has some eloquence. But it is simpler to consider the problem, and it is more careless. Perhaps he thought that 'the speakers' innocence' had been insured, and also pulled a Korean classmate Kim Dong-wook in his class, and wrote Long Wen, 'On the State is, and Commencement' in mid-June. The point is: From the argument that socialism needs to have a more advanced democracy than capitalism, boldly excuse the newspaper's quoted right-wing remarks, such as Zhang Bojun's 'Institute of Political Design', and the 'Party World'... This article was first published by the Office of the School Breeze, and then it was published in full by Changchun Daily. At the end of June, the school stopped to test the right, and the main venue on the reverse right was located in the small auditorium upstairs of the teaching staff canteen. In general, the right of the teachers was criticized by other organizations such as the NLD in the city. Hu Xianzhong and Lu Zhongyan... students became the main role in the campus venue. \\nAt the beginning of the debate, Hu Xian Center was in good mood. He also posted a large print newspaper 'Right to Reply and Fight Form':\\nWalk in the corridor, cold eyes laughing at wild flowers;\\nUrgent field, hot bowel angry sword and lip gun. \\nAt the beginning, the debated person sat on the dock. This is not a place of simple reasoning, but you cannot look at wild flowers and grass in cold eyes. Hu Xianzhong soon defeated with a sword and lip gun and a thunderstorm, and his last word appeared in the corridor:\\nIt is said to be good for the party, please see the big print newspaper nearby! \\nIt is said to be a debate, please see the event at the venue and after the meeting! It is said to be 'wind and rain', but now the lightning deal. \\nOk! Let the storm come more intense! \\nMidnight star is about to land,\\nThe beating line of the heart will stop,\\nIf there are good people, secretly sprinkle a few drops of tears,\\nLet's irrigate wildflowers on the top of the solitary grave! \\nFor this, there is sympathy with postmortem affixed large print statements, and there is also a secret sigh. However, Hu Xianzhong's heart did not stop beating, but took the opportunity to return to Jiangxi's home in the summer and went to the British office in China in Dongjiao Minxiang, Beijing. It was not possible to accept it immediately, but could only return to school. Shortly arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment for 'treason' (later commuted to 10 years imprisonment), ②. \\nAgainst the right, if the most famous right among students in the country were Lin Xiling and Tan Tianrong, the most famous right wing in the Northeast region was not Hu Xianzhong, the Northeast People's Congress was the only comprehensive university in the Northeast at that time. His outstanding remarks were also very vivid, and the masterpiece was published in several full editions in the party newspaper. After Hu Xianzhong was corrected, the Chinese Communist Party was also restored, first arranged in the school department of economics, and then revised the 'Economic aspect' magazine, and also had some academic achievements. She is still living in Changchun after her leave. Mrs. Shi is also an educator. With a woman, the company is now sent to Europe and the United States to work. \\nSecond, pure and sincere Deng Rongling\\nUnder the call to 'help the party to rectify the wind', the orange-yellow newspaper appeared downstairs of the Department of Mathematics. This is a new thing. It is quite sensational at a moment. President Kuang Yaming also came to the news. In one of the large print newspapers, a Student Forum was proposed and signed by the proponents. People are cautious that the signature space left only one name: 'Tang Rongling'. \\nDeng Rongling Shanghai, whose father worked in Shanghai Customs before liberation, continued to be a customs leader since 1949. Although she was born from a Christian family, her family had members of her family at the top of both parties. This person, a first-year student in the physics department, appeared at the debate and was very beautiful and dignified. Medium body, slightly plump round face, speaks Mandarin with Shanghai accents. At first, she had not been the subject of debate, but she had repeatedly stated that free democracy was good and seemed to be firmly committed to liberal democracy. Most of the critics persuaded her to turn back in persuasive language, but she stood firmly on the side of Hu Xianzhong and Lu Zhongyan... criticians, pleading for them. Hu Xianzhong posted the Last Word. She solemnly posted the big print 'Lamentation' to mourn:\\nEpient classmates: You are strong! \\nGao Song! \\nWind Xiao (Xi), easy water cold,\\nWarriors are gone. \\nAs such, her rightist fate is irreparable. \\nDeng Rongling had borrowed a book at the Philosophy Research Laboratory. It seems that the book is very rich and very simple. It seems to be a little child who does not understand the situation and the waves. In the fight against the right, Deng Rongling had prepared to study in Europe. Luckily, there is no more action, otherwise there will be one more charge. After the reform and opening up, I returned to Changchun and heard that Deng Rongling was dead. Later it was known that this person had uremia and died in a re-education unit in the suburbs of Shanghai. But it doesn't seem like normal death to be discovered three days after death. A naive, sincere, stubborn girl so quietly disappeared from the sea! Deng Rongling probably won't have the same theoretical talents as Lin Xiling, but their strong and unyielding character is very similar. \\nIn the fourth year of the Department of Economics, there are many Korean students. Most of the Korean compatriots are simple and rich in a sense of justice. Kim Dong-Yu, who wrote together with Hu Xianzhong, is a more relevant person, and of course does not take off the ethnic temperament of the ethnic people. After correcting the right, working at the Party School of the CPC Liaoning Provincial Committee, I saw him in Shenyang in the 90s. \\nIn that year, the Northeast people's Congress, the three faculties of numerical physics and chemistry were large departments, and there were many students, and more classified as the right Yu Ruihuang, director of the physics department, classified as the right, some students expressed sympathy for the grievances ③, the Department of Mathematics is the birthplace of the big print newspaper in the school, the right of both students naturally more. In proportion to the number of right-wing people, the Chinese language department is probably the highest. This is related to the circulation of anti-bureaucratic works such as 'Bridge Construction Site' (Liu Binyan), 'New Young People from the Organization Department' (Wang Meng). The department is said to have a class with only 20 students, but four right-wing, or 1/5 of the class. \\nThere was another rumor at that time. A student who is the secretary of the mission branch of Northeast Normal University criticized another classmate's right-wing words and deeds. Later, the two people went to the South Lake to exchange views. Later they twisted up and fell into the lake. The grievances of the criticized classmates can only sink into the bottom of the lake forever. The group books had to be accompanied by the criticized classmates at the bottom of the lake, and there was no good future. \\nIII. Yu Ding Xu right-wing group\\nThe most shocking of the teachers against the right is Yu Ding Xu right group. In 1952, Tsinghua University was transformed into a simple university of engineering, and all the subjects of arts and science were integrated into his university. Yu Ruihuang (1906-1997), Ding Zeliang (1915-1957), Xu Lizhi (1920-), and others were all transferred from Tsinghua to the Northeast People's Congress. These people have studied in Europe and the United States, and have seen the world. Although Lu Zhenyu (1900-1980), president of the Northeastern People's Congress (1900-1980), was also a famous scholar, but after all, he worked in the liberated areas for a long time. It was not easy to properly lead these senior intellectuals. \\nXu Lizhi, professor of mathematics, first wrote a long letter to the Ministry of Higher Education, reflecting the opinions of the faculty leaders. In 1954, the Ministry of Higher Education sent an inspection team to school for this purpose. Ding Zeliang and others made a lot of opinions at the meeting. It is generally not enough respect for teachers, no reuse, life treatment... there are not necessarily many questions of principle. Since then, President Lu Zhenyu transferred Beijing, Yi-Qun, Zhengzhou, Kuang Yaming (1906-1997), to serve as the president and secretary of the Communist Party Committee of the CPC. President Kuang is a Danyang from Jiangsu Province. He was vice-minister of propaganda department of East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. The younger age is also more able to approach the majority of teachers and students, and there has also been some improvement after school work. Yu Ruihuang was the former director of the Department of Physics and was elected member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Academician). Ding Zeliang was promoted to the deputy director of the Department of History, while Xu Lizhi was deputy director of the Department of Mathematics and Director of the Things have ended here, but the anti-right movement suddenly changed. \\nYu Ding Xu was originally all intellectuals who had drank foreign ink. He also had a common opinion on the leadership of the school party, and it was a logical thing to classify the right. The anti-party groups have a more positive example to follow, and it cannot be said that there is no reason to deduct the right-wing opposition group. Yu Ruihuang is said to be the head of the anti-party group, Ding Zeliang is a military division, Xu Lizhi is an urgent pioneer and a party investigation. Yu Ruihuang once expressed his willingness to take over as vice-chancellor, just to get the title of 'bourgeois ambition'. Guan Mengjue, head of the Department of Economics, is very positive and artistic. Many times quoted 'Xixiang Notes' in the speech of the conference, ironizing Yu Ruihuang's pursuit of a lesbian, and also touches on Lei Zhenwu's family trivia. But most people are not interested in this, but rather bored. \\nXu Lizhi is Dongrong Town, Changshu County, Jiangsu (now belongs to Zhangjiagang City), has a happy family, beautiful lady. Her wife could not be subjected to political pressure and soon divorced. Ding Zeliang, a well-known expert in Asian history, was attending an academic conference in the Soviet Union at the beginning of the anti-right. Returning to Beijing to learn that he had been caught in a right-wing anti-party set, he was stuck at night into the Unnamed Lake of Peking University. The water of the lake is shallow, and this person is said to have chew the soil at the bottom of the lake. It seems determined not to accept the help of the people at the fighting meeting. \\nEighty-nine people in the Department of Philosophy were drawn three right. The anti-right indicator of the school has yet to be completed. In 1958, the counterright fill lesson will put Zou Huazheng, lecturer Hou, deputy director of the teaching and research department. Zou Huazheng has long advocated the division of labor between teaching and ideological work, and that those involved in teaching political classes do not have to regulate students' intellectual work. This, albeit inconsistent with high-level intentions, is only a job deployment issue. Hou fangzi right is more dramatic. Originally as a lecturer HD Hai, he was promoted to associate professor for criticism of Huagang plagiarism. President Hou Fangxiangkuang made several comments, and the two people were disheartened. Zhengxiao Ding Liangtou Lake did its own, President Kuang, in order to recover some influence among intellectuals, approved a more generous funeral fee of 1,000 yuan (at that time the lecturer's maximum monthly salary of 80 yuan). Hou put on the entrance hall of the school posted a pay big word coupling:\\nXi Yunfengding hit the principal, but there was no big mistake. For many years, the revolution was in danger of a paper dismissal order \\nDing Ze Liangtou Lake committed suicide and killed a few years, and the opposition party still received a thousand yuan of burial money \\nXi Yunfeng is an electrician, inadvertently hit the head of Kuang, of course, the main purpose of the coupling is to downlink Hou has always been far left in the anti-right, and there is little sympathy after being classified as the right. Zhu Wujia was a student of the mathematics department. Later, the Philosophy Department was classified as the right at the beginning of the anti-right phase. Later, sentenced to 10 years for attempting to leave the country. The mathematics papers he wrote under the guidance of Xu Lizhi have reacted abroad, and taught at Nanjing University, Nanjing Aeronautical College, etc. To commemorate Xu Liye, won a son named Zhu Lizhi. \\nTeachers in the Department of Economics became more than one from the right, such as Zhang Liangbi, who taught statistical principles. A young teacher with the name of Su, said on his back that a line of leaders is the 'indigenous emperor', and the family composition is not good, he drew on the right. Another, Zhang Chichen, who taught 'Capital Theory', was arrested for a short period of time before liberation before liberation, but did not have any specific sin, and later he was rehabilitated. Zhang Rujyi, who once stayed in the United States, has a more complex history. It is said to have a special suspicion and the right side There are more right-wing faculty members of the law faculty, such as Mr. Wang Huiyan, who went to the Department of Economics to give us an introduction to state and law. After the announcement as the right, a change to the usual attire was very simple, it was felt that this person was very honest, very tamed. \\nTeng Fei, deputy director of the revolutionary history department, was the old revolution that took part in the work in 1938. It was also a person who had more interests and had no tightness in the Ju Bazar. The counterright remedial hours were also drawn in, and could only be wronged. Wang Fuquan, an old professor of the Chinese language department and librarian, and Tian Shengchun, lecturer in the Chinese language department, said that 'the junned family woman is hard to do', all become the right. Professor Lu Qinchi, Department of History, Suzhou. The paper discusses the seizure of northeastern territory by Saudi Arabia and has also become the right. \\nThere was an ironic incident outside school during the school's anti-right climax. Fan Zheng, Propaganda Minister of the CPC Changchun Municipal Committee, also made a counter-right report at the municipal committee on the first day, but the next day the newspaper declared that he was classified as the right. This was a young and versatile young man who had joined the Communist Party at the age of 13 in the very age of 31. This person picked his hat in the early 60s, and the Cultural Revolution still could not stand up to brutal criticism and committed suicide. The matter adds a psychological shadow of secrecy and unpredictable fate. \\nIV. Review over half a century later\\nThe reason for the fight against right is to guide the vast majority of intellectuals and young students to give opinions to the Communist Party, using rhetoric such as 'helping the party to rectify' and 'not guilty'. As a result, a large number of people who had raised opinions into the right, pushed to the opposite side, punished, sentenced and even killed their homes. This act of defiance is by no means a way of politics, neither the interests of the general population nor the will of the people. 'Yang Mou', 'Snake out of the hole'... are all serious mistakes and improper rhetoric. \\nIf anti-Hu Feng only hurts a relatively small range of literary and artistic circles, it is the vast number of intellectuals that hurt against the right. Such people as Yu Dingxu and others have made great achievements in scientific research and teaching, are all rich and strong years. They are all the backbone forces that the new China science and education front is so much needed. As a result, the person was killed or severely hit, causing irreparable damage. People lament that there is still a large gap between our ability to innovate and developed countries, that nobody has won the Nabel Prize in more than 60 years of statehood... It is hard to say that this has nothing to do with the anti-right movement of 1957. \\nIt is even more unreasonable to beat a large number of young students into the right. Young people are certainly inexperienced and do not know the risks and risks. On the other hand, it is entirely right and justice to look at young students calling for the expansion of democratic freedoms. Demands that democracy, freedom reflect human nature, no one is born to be a slave! To make horse cattle! The Communist Party, under the banner of democracy and freedom, led the people to overthrow the 'Chiang Kai-shek dictatorship'. The republic means a democratic system, freedoms, and clearly defined in the Constitution. Jiang Shang, a great politician in ancient China, has proposed 'the world of the world, the world of not one person.' Confucius also said that 'the three armies can take their handsome, piff is inexorable' ('Theory • Zihan'). 'Remembrance • Fortune' also said: 'Road trip, the world is public.' Democracy and freedom are not unique to the West, nor are they patented by the West. What is wrong with young students asking for greater democracy and freedom! What sin! Not only is there no mistake, but it is the precious intentions and actions that follow the trends of history. The destruction under the people's power is not only in contravention of the commitments made during the period of the wind, the commitments made to the people in the years of the revolutionary war, but also with the provisions of the Constitution and the socialist system of ownership by the people. \\n'Correctly Handling the Problems of Intra-People's Contradictions' was officially published in the People's Daily on June 19, 1957. In terms of six of the criteria for determining whether it is wrong = 4\\\\ * GB3 ④, it would have not been in February speech. The problem is that none of them has a clear line between guilt and non-guilt and have not been subject to legislative procedures. Under conditions where there is a serious tendency to do not right, expansion is inevitable. There must be rules of governance, there must be the rule of law, and the clearer feudal era, some things are not entirely personal. Political movements since 1949 have been guilty of the problem of rhetoric. Anti-party groups, Hu Feng elements, right-wing activists, right-wing opportunists, until capitalist power, have no clear concepts and boundaries. There is serious confusion between the relationship and the enemy relationship, and finally a large number of false and wrong cases have been formed. \\nIt is not only intellectuals against the right to harm, but also directly or indirectly to the vast majority of workers and farmers. In 1958, the Great Leap Forward, carried out beating in rural areas, falsely stating that the mu produced tens of thousands of pounds of grain, even hundreds of thousands of pounds, and then went to the farmer This is similar to a play, but after the right, no one dare to tell the truth. In the summer of 1959, when Peng Dehuai gave his opinion in Lushan, a serious disaster was spreading. Instead of inspecting themselves, the person in charge is concealing the disaster from the people throughout the country and avoiding responsibility. Even beating a rake, Peng, Huang, Zhang, Zhou and others who made the right opinion into a right-leaning optionist anti-party group. And then launched a powerful anti-right and drumming movement across the country. At last, the disaster was exacerbated by starving tens of millions of people in times of peace. The majority of those who die of starvation are farmers, and workers and all urban dwellers have long lived with low supply and inadequate food. In the era of false rhetoric, Lin Biao, Kang Sheng, Ke Qingshi and other Alpha molecules ripped up, social normality suffered more serious damage. \\nIf anti-Hu Feng is a rehearsal against the right, anti-right is the rehearsal of the Cultural Revolution. Through rehearsals again and again, the final decision power of the top leader within the party has finally become a voice and exclusive right in the whole Party and the whole country. The Communist Party was supposed to be the collective leadership of a large group of revolutionaries, and at this time it became difficult to function as a collective leader. Nor can they think of the abnormal handling of any one, and the same fate is likely to come to their turn. Given the situation of the international communist movement and the influence of history within the country and within the party, they have not, after all, been able to prevent the abnormal handling of Hu Feng, Panhannian and others. Reversing the right may be the last chance to block the abnormal pattern of power within the party, but this is difficult, although the situation in the Soviet Union has improved, and calls against personal worship have echoed both at home and abroad. The severe fight against the right has finally completed the target and the victory ends. After the anti-right, Siqing, the Cultural Revolution havoc has been inevitable! \\n'Do not forget, after the matter', when people look at the development process and look at the history of more than half a century ago, the following points cannot fail to pay attention. First, further reform of the power structures of the Party and the State must be supervised and constrained. The power granted by the people should not allow anyone to act with impunity. Second, the victims who are against the right are not rectified, they are completely rehabilitated, publicly apologized and given appropriate compensation. Third, strengthen history education and commemoration, and raise people's vigilance. It is important to keep in mind that similar mistakes are no longer repeated in thousands of generations. \\nAnnotations:\\n① Hu wind event triggered internal revolt, triggered by text prison, the touch surface will be very wide.

				"memoirContent": "【Attachment 2】Hu Xianzhong: 'Middle Right'-The Ignored Group (Manuscript)\\nToday's young friends and even middle-aged people do not know what the 'middle right' means. In fact, the full name should be called 'center right', which is a 'variety' unique to the anti-right struggle in 1957. \\nAccording to Mao Zedong, 'Where there are crowds, all places can be divided into the left, center and right. It remains so ten thousand years later.' In order to facilitate the struggle against the enemy, among the right, it must be subdivided into three categories of far-right, right and center right. \\nThe proposal of the 'center right' should be traced back to the height of the anti-right struggle, namely, the instructions issued by the CPC Central Committee on 1 August 1957 to continue to deepen the opposition to the right. In this most important document, for the first time, the far-right, ordinary right and center-right concepts were used and called for an accurate distinction between the three categories of people. By October 15, the CPC Central Committee issued criteria for dividing right-wing elements. The third element of this criterion is: 'If there is one of the following circumstances, the error should be corrected, but not classified as right-wing'. A total of six cases are enumerated (omitted). At the same time, in the notice that the document was issued, said: 'Some center-right elements have spoken and deeds against socialism, but not enough for the right. If they are struggling as the right, do not now declare publicly that their criticism is wrong because there is a mistake that should be criticized. But internally converted to center-right elements, treated according to the center-right elements, and pay attention to more education, and at the appropriate time can declare repentance due to minor circumstances and take off their right-wing hat.' \\nThis document instructs to be 'treated as the middle right molecule'. So, specifically, how is it treated? I was a classmate Li Qian jiaxie at level 53 in Political Economics, Department of Economics, Northeastern People's University. According to his inner thought, it should be said that I, Jin Dongyu (now a researcher of the Party School of the Liaoning Provincial Committee), and others are basically similar, so the three people often talk together about politics and praise people (from central leaders to class cadres). In short, they are unspeakable iron buddies. In the time of the great magnification, we have more discussion with each other. Finally, one day, the three of us posted a big print. Its content has long been forgotten. Only remember this day that the big winds were scratched and ran away in a while. This is really God's care, otherwise, this Li Qian jiaxie may not run the end of being classified as the right. Later, Kim and I were classified as the right for other, more serious' crimes', and I was more 'far-right. ' Since neither I nor Kim Dong-wook learned to 'fight against a blow' and 'make a good atonement', he did not 'bite' out of Li Qian jiaxie, so he was able to escape the robbery. In the days after each side, life and death were lost. By 1980 I was corrected, Kim Dong-wook first telegram congratulated. This Li Qian jiaxie also came to Changchun due to events, of course, to see me. For more than 20 years not seen, the two met, and if they were separated, they talked to each other for an afternoon. According to him, after graduation, he was assigned to a university in Jinzhou City, Liaoning Province, but had not been allowed to take him to the podium, but worked for a long time in the library. What is the nature of the data room? \\nAfter returning to my alma mater for a couple of years, I knew that the library seemed like a reservoir, where the level was not enough or not enough to get to the podium, or those who did not worry about getting him to the rostrum, such as the center-right elements with political problems, returning from overseas or having overseas ties... and so on, are temporary. Or stay in the data room for a long or permanent period. Today's famous economist Professor Li Yining was placed in the data room at that time. Moreover, according to Hu Ping's book 'Zen Machine: 1957' (published by Guangdong Tourism Publishing House), the author's father, Professor Hu Zhengwu of Jiangxi Normal University, was also scheduled to study after being classified as the right The school's library is engaged in materials work (p. 867 of the book). They are classified as 'teaching assistance' that is to perform complementary teaching work. In my impression, Li Qian jiaxie originally performed very well. Whether it was writing or eloquence, he was upstream in the class. But because of the 'middle and right members' hat, it has been buried in the data room for more than 20 years. What's more outrageous is that no one has ever told him why not let him go to the rostrum? Although how many times he asked, it did not help. He never understood what the problem was. It was until 1979, when document 55 came down, he woke up like a dream: it turned out! But he is already nearly 50 years old. At this age, let him go to the podium, starting with the assistant, that's a joke! \\nIt should be said that Li Qian jiaxie is still relatively lucky because he has a job after all. There is also a classmate (who respects his own wishes, obscures the name). He was the same class with us, but in\\nIn the 1955 anti-opposition movement, because Zhang Mu, secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, also said that 'in the history of the Communist Party, there are only two men's merit of Lenin and Stalin', 'Chairman Mao himself said: Changchun's auto factory is not named Mao Zedong Automobile Factory as good.' As a result, the anti-rebellion movement has been coined as serious crimes such as 'scolding Stalin' and 'attacking the great leader'. He was not aware of these things at the time, and of course he was not able to check, could not pass through, and was expelled from school. He also disobedience and wrote a letter. Under the orders of the Changchun Municipal Committee, the school admits 'dealing with errors' and revoked him back, but he was not willing to continue studying, he was assigned to the philosophy classroom. Since then, he spoke at academic conferences and received the attention and support of many party committee members and faculty members attending the conference, organizing ministers and personally committed themselves to 'arranging teaching work in the future. ' Unfortunately, soon under the guidance of 'Yang Mou', a whirlwind of 'anti-right-wing', he said when Hungary withdrew from the China Treaty Group that 'exit is also OK', after internal criticism, was defined as 'middle right', rural labor exercise, from light to the west of Jilin Province Learn to teach history lessons. Later, the Shangshu County Bureau of Education revealed that school leaders were falsifying in the uniform examination, and even calling for the expansion of democracy within the Party and raising the price of agricultural products, were considered to be 'leaking the right'. He also contacted the Indian embassy in China to seek shelter and was sentenced to seven years. Later, wearing a counter-revolutionary hat, repatriated to Jiangsu origin for a long time in agricultural work. In 1980, he engaged in teaching work in a university in Jiangsu after the rehabilitation. Over the past 20 years there have been many research results in the fields of Confucianism, urban construction, administrative division... etc. \\nFifty years later today, I followed by the footsteps of all my classmates and their current state of existence, with an astonishing finding: the worst and most persecuted in our class was me and this 'middle right' friend, followed by my 'co-perpetrator' Kim Dong-wook and Xie Yongxin (said to be the father of Xie Pro once served as Zhang Xueliang's personal secretary. This is, of course, 'historical counter-revolution' , was badly fought during the 'Cultural Revolution' and later returned to his homeland due to illness. (In the process of curing the disease, I met a Chinese medicine medicine doctor, first cure, after the worship teacher, finally learned, is a famous local doctor of traditional Chinese medicine, and has a considerable skill in life sciences, published several writings). Other students have lived peacefully and safely for decades. But more than 20 years after the reform and opening up, most of them have had no significant performance. Those who died died and were alive have disappeared and spent their old age. Using computer 'Baidu' search function, still active in academic forums, only me and the 'middle right' friend. Why do the two of us have so tenacious vitality and the ability to innovate academically? Is there an intrinsic causal relationship between this and the suffering we have experienced? If so, what is the nature of causation? Are we persecuted because we are all daring and thinking, or because we have experienced particularly severe persecution that activates the potential thinking in our minds? What in the end is the cause and who is the fruit? Or are cause and effect each other? To explain this phenomenon, perhaps ask Marx, who says 'Thinking makes people suffer, and suffering causes people to think.' There should be a causal interaction between the two, right? \\nTo this day, many books, recalling the history of the anti-right movement, focus on those 'rightists, 'which of course are necessary, while few mention or neglect of the 'middle right' friends who have also eaten for more than 20 years. It seems that they are a bunch of people who have been overlooked. \\nOther units or departments, did the year have the 'middle right' molecule? I don't know. In my class alone, 18 people in the class, two right-wing were drawn. The scale is 1/9. This ratio basically coincides with the country (5 million intellectuals divided 550,000 right-wing, and 1/9). As to whether any other person in my class is classified as 'middle right', I don't know that Li Qian jiaxie and another friend are just two of what I know. \\nHow many are the 'middle right' elements in the country? I'm afraid anyone is not clear. You know only: in the 1957 anti-right movement, more than 550,000 rightists were drawn. In fact, this is only an estimate. The exact number disclosed by Mr. Dai Huang on page 17 of the book Hu Yaobang and the Correction and False Cases is: 552, 877. At the same time, the author also points out that this figure does not include 'samples' left for correction, nor does it include university students, secondary school students, private teachers, business and industry, democratic parties, etc. who are not yet included in the ranks of national cadres; moreover, there are 'tens of thousands of people who do not wear right-wing hats without right hats Internal control of the 'right''. According to Mr. Zhu Zheng, on page 502 of Summer 1957, Uli Franz, Germany, said in Deng Xiaoping, a Chinese political legend, '800,000 party members and non-party members have been classified as right-wing from 1957 to 1958. 800,000 minus 550,000, of which the difference is 250,000, who is this 250,000? I'm afraid it is wearing what is said to be 'right without the right hat and internal control', that is, what this article refers to as 'middle right' is also. \\nAccording to the truth, the 'center right' is the middle right, essentially should belong to the centrist, even at the time it should be an internal problem of the people, and should not enter the enemy's domain at all. However, in the age of the extreme left route ravaged, class struggles expanded to include the 'center right' as a subcategory of the right, counting as the enemy category, but they themselves did not know. This is not surprising, and the problem is that they did not even have a place to appeal, and there are no units or people responsible for them in the subsequent rehabilitation process. \\nWhat is the point of raising the 'middle right' question? There! This is undoubtedly of some historical value for studying China's legal history, China's human rights development history, and even China's social history. It is also a good negative teaching material for the goals we have proposed today to establish a socialist state rule of law and administration according to law."

People to old age always love nostalgia, often thoughts, not coveable at night, evoke my memories of past sour and happiness. In the autumn of 1954, I was admitted to the Department of History of Fujian Teachers College and was taught by many famous teachers. Among them, Mr. Qian Lizhou, who teaches 'Classical Chinese Literature', is one of my long-loved practitioners. With the passage of time, 57 years have passed, but Mr. smiling and caring for the post-school scene, still lingering. Mr. personality charisma, professionalism, straight character, attitude and love love, have given me a lifetime of people and learning to subvert influence, leaving an indelible impression in my heart. \\n(1)\\nMr. Qian Zongqi, word Zhou, ancestors of Shaoxing, Zhejiang, Fuzhou. Born in Qingguangxu twenty years \\\\([0-9]{4}-\\\\), died in July 1982, is a well-known poetry and literary and historical expert in Fuzhou. He graduated from Fujian University of Legal Affairs in his early years. He is one of the scholars who have contributed to the exchange of Chinese and Western culture. \\nAfter graduating from secondary school, Mr. Li Houji, North Ocean Warlord Li Houji, he briefly served as a primary school teacher. Due to diligent learning, talented and agile, Expo group books, smart people, and writing writing. In December 1926, after the occupation of Fuzhou, a chance, he was appreciated by the then provincial finance department director Ho Gong, absorbed into the work of the Department of Finance. Since then, he began his 20-year career in politics. Realize his original intention of 'civil affairs, benefit Sang Zi'. \\nIn 1933, Li Jishen, Jiang Guangnai, Chen Mingshu and Cai Tingkai launched anti-Jiang 'Min Change' and set up the 'People's Revolutionary Government of the Republic of China' to crush Chiang Kai-shek. After the failure, Fujian political situation was restructured, the then national government appointed Chen Yi as chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government.

Daily desk files as high as feet, can be easily reviewed, do not make stay and delay the transfer; and at any time to his top supervisor to make suggestions to improve provincial government, he won the trust and trust of Chen Yi, to become a strong assistant. \\nIn 1942, Chen Yi changed as Secretary General of the National Government Executive Council. Mr. Chan also traveled to Chongqing as Secretary of the Executive Council. He also received Chuiqing of Jiang Tingqu, secretary of the Executive Council. \\nIn August 1945, Japan surrendered unconditionally. As stipulated in the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, the Allies returned to the motherland 50 years after ceding Taiwan to Japan by signing the Treaty of Ma Guan in 1895. Chen Yi is the Chief Executive of Taiwan and Jiang Tingchun is the Director of the National Relief Administration. Mr. Qian was appointed Director of Taiwan Relief Branch on the recommendation of Chen and Jiang. The Agency is the agency that receives US aid to China and forwards relief to the poor. Most of the parties concerned use this as a 'fat shortage', saturated in their own hands, corruption and corruption. Mr. alone 'integrity, innocence', and the subordinate requirements are extremely strict and cause dissatisfaction. Elite everywhere, 'The word of mouth of honor for integrity has been spread.' \\nIn the spring of 1947, Taiwan's monopoly bureau armed smuggling brigade and police assaulted female cigarette traffickers in Taipei City, robbed 6,000 yuan in cash, and shot and killed a citizen who was on the scene. With this as a fuse, a large-scale intifada against the tyranny of the Kuomintang government broke out across the province. Mr. Wei enjoys the protection of Taiwan compatriots in the name of integrity. safe and unharmed. After the incident, Chen Yi, who was the chief minister of Taiwan's chief minister and commander-in-chief of the police, was dismissed; exactly then the work of the Relief Branch Office was nearing the end, and Mr. went back to the Nanjing Executive Council. \\nIn 1948, Chiang Kai-shek appointed Chen Yi as chairman of the Zhejiang provincial government and Mr. Chen Chenqian as a member of the provincial government. In the spring of 1949, after the three major battles of Liao Shen, Pingjin and Huaihai ended, Chen Yi-jian Chiang Kai-shek has gone and prepared a uprising under the initiative of my underground party to fight for the peaceful liberation of Zhejiang. For this reason, Mr. Chan Yi was arrested because of the incident. After the news, he quickly returned from Hangzhou to join the China Democratic League. He dared to introduce him to join the China Democratic League. \\nIn August 1949, Fuzhou 'liberation', he dare to serve as the Dean of Fujian College, hiring Mr. Qian as a professor and vice president. From now on, he began a seven-year career from politics to a covenant. \\nIn 1952, the country's colleges and colleges adjusted, Fujian College merged into the newly established Fuzhou University. Soon Fuzhou University was abolished, by merging several universities in Banyan, renamed Fujian Normal College. Mr. Qian was hired as a professor and head of the Chinese Classical Literature Teaching Group (Faculty Director). He taught Chinese Classical Literature and Writing among undergraduate students in both Chinese and History until the summer of 1957 was misdesignated as the right and deprived of the right to teach. In 1979, the 'right' hat was worn for 32 years. Three years later, Fuzhou died, was 88 years old. \\n(II)\\nMr. Qian private school enlightenment, good learning from early childhood, Expo history. He once said that he was most admired by two people: the patriotic democracy thinker on the occasion of Mingqing, and Huang Zongxi of Yuyao, Zhejiang Province, and Sun Yat-sen, a pioneer of China's democratic revolution. \\nMr. Huang Zongxi's thoughts and doctrine, admired five bodies. 'In the feudal era, Huang Zongxi can put forward the view of 'Jun is guest, democracy is democratically',' said. Huang Zongxi thinks that 'the monarch sees the world as a great industry', 'knocking off the world's bone marrow, discrete children of the world, in order to love one man', 'the monarch with the stripping of the world to himself; is the great damage of the world.' 'The chaos of the world is not in the flourishing of one surname, but in the worries of all people.' 'The peace of life of the people is the rule, and the people's living hardship is chaos.' Mr. was inspired and enlightened from the doctrine and thought of Xiang Xian. From it, he realized that intellectuals should take integrity as the criterion, and do more good things. Mr said: 'Huang Zongxi is a patriotic democratist who deplores the monarchy.' Therefore, for more than 20 years of service in politics, Mr. Qian has exercised himself and adheres to the principle of 'integrity for officials and for the benefit of the people.' Be it secretary in the provincial treasury department, the Executive Council. Or as director of the Taiwan Relief Agency Branch Office, they can do 'clean and clean.' \\nMr. is not only my practitioner, but also my 'forgettable'. At that time he was nearly a flower, and I was 20 years old. When talking with Mr. after school, he said that in late April 1912, he was waiting to welcome Mr. Sun Yat-sen in Fuzhou City on the day of late April 1912, but the specific circumstances were not detailed. It was until November 5, 1956, in the Journal of Fujian Teachers College, No. 58, published an article 'My Respect and Memorial to Dr Sun Yat-sen' to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the birth of Dr Sun Yat-sen. It says: 'I was 15 years old at the time of the 1911 Revolution, I was studying in the third grade of five years of high school. I saw that the Qing Dynasty was overthrown for more than 200 years of despotism. 'Sovereignty is in the people' (there are these four words in the Interim Treaty Act), there is a kind of unspoken in my childish mind The excitement of Sun Yat-sen, who led the revolution at that time, also had great admiration.' \\nMr. Wen Zhongqian also introduced the scene of Sun Yat-sen's meeting with students: 'At the end of the second spring, Sun Yat-sen came to Fuzhou from Shanghai. On April 21, this day is closed to welcome Mr. Sun's arrival. At 2:00 in the afternoon, there was a more happy news. Students from various schools in situ team focused on Gongyuancheng to welcome Mr. Sun. It is our turn to go in, and we saw Mr. Sun standing on a conference table, with a number of people accompanying him. Each of us walked in front of Mr. Sun to stand, bow a bow, he put his hand, or caress the shoulder, I was the one who was stroked. Mr. Sun said: 'Good book, serve the country in the future, serve the people. ' Since then, Mr. Qian has always put this phrase as a motto, urging himself to read, and also hopes that 'the students who have been transferred to me more than a year, as my permanent respect and honor for Mr. Sun.' \\nHis admiration for Xiang Xian Huang Zongxi and Sun Yat-sen, the pioneer of China's democratic revolution, can be seen from this. Take their doctrines and legacies as the code of conduct for 'integrity and democracy' in politics, and for learning 'diligent reading and working for the country'. \\n(3)\\nMr. Qian came to the Fujian Teachers College to teach, good view is not long. At the end of the spring of 1957, in 'helping the Party to rectify the wind', an incident of insulting female teachers and female employees by Kang Xingke, a cadre of the college personnel department and a member of the Communist Party, was uncovered, sparked a huge wave of dissatisfaction and anger of the vast majority of teachers and students, and called for serious treatment of the Party's scum Kangxingke. \\nMr., as alternate member of the provincial NLD, with the goodwill of 'not guilty, hear the word' and speak at various colloquiums 'to help the party rectify'. He put forward some pertinent comments and suggestions on issues such as 'counteraction' and 'personnel system reform'. But at that time, under the ridiculous logic of criticizing individual disqualified party members, that is, 'anti-party'; together with the factional disputes within the Chinese language system, some Xiao Xiaolans sought political capital for an airplane, using a despicable act of hearsay, inconclusive, and fabricated facts, using the form of a big song, magnification, and big word, on the first. The charges of injustice are intended to be put to death and then quickly. Turn the 'whole wind movement' quickly to a 'anti-right' struggle. Mr. also escaped this, not spared. A 'verbal' edge refers to the gentle and elegant Mr.. I have saved the 1957 Journal of Fujian Normal Institute, the paper has been yellow, but the eye is a line of striking words: 'Qian Liuzhou is the horse pawns of Yan's Uncle Xia right group', 'The reactionary nature of Qian Zhou', 'Strongly refuting the relentless expose money Shou Zhou and other right-wing elements'... The article disregarded the facts, randomly fabricated, framed the attack, characterized Mr. as 'right'. Since then, he was deprived of the right to teaching and was left from the rostrum for 21 years. The grievances made him extremely sad and depressed, until 1979 did not get a complete crackdown. \\nAfter the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Party Central Committee, he made chaos. Mr. Mu spring wind, heart blooming, feel relaxed, to the spirit and energy of 'old Ji Fudong, not yourself', sometimes in the West Lake Park stroll scenery, sometimes in the tea house chat with old friends. Mr. was invited to serve as a member of the provincial CPPCC and was hired as a librarian in Fujian, and then grasped the pen with the spirit of 'just dying for the evening', play the heat, put his own knowledge of Fuzhou literature and history and personal experience, written more than 30 articles, together with the old work in Fujian Literature and History Materials, Published on. Among them are historical evidence, such as 'the small history of the Imperial Pavilion', 'Yuan Shikai's time to be imperial', etc. Some people say, such as 'Keeping Tan Shuqing', 'Sun Benrong', 'Li Houji and Liu Guanxiong', 'I know Yan Jiao', 'Memories of Fang Erhao Martyrs', 'Teacher Lu Yi', etc.; Smell, such as 'Lin Xiongxiang Borrowing Notes', 'Fuzhou Social Memories', 'Remember Sun Yat-sen to Fuzhou', Remember one of the earliest student union in Fujian-the Quanmin Student Union, 'Memories of Taiwan's aftermath relief work', etc.; have contacts with celebrities, such as 'Yu Duff in Fuzhou', 'Chen Yizhong, I know Chen Yi', and so on; have read and postschool notes, such as Mr. Liu Tong, Chen Zejing 'After reading the information of Lin Yongsa', 'Fujian North Ocean Warlord Li Houji', 'New China' Evolution〉Translation After Reading and so on...\\n These words are fresh, well-written, informative, rich in content, are very precious cultural heritage and first-hand information that Mr. left to future generations. \\nIn addition, Mr. works of classical poetry, has selected 'Qing Poem Selection', and left a large number of works, not collected and collated before his life, the second year after the death of Mr. Xian, that is, 1983 by Fujian Yat Xian Yi Yuan as 'The Legacy Poems of Mr. Qian Lizhou' published. \\n(4)\\nMr. Lu Chow and my other practitioner, Mr. Wong Tseng-yue, were called the 'Gemini' of the Chinese Department. Both work in the creation of classical Chinese poetry and local literature and history in Fujian; and both have the experience of being honest as an official and working as an official. In 1957, after Mr. Qian was mistaken as the 'right', the more 10 years, the 'Cultural Revolution' havoc rose again, and Mr. Zeng Yue was persecuted by the 'villains' and killed in the Wushan Road apartment. After the news, Mr. Lou Zhou dared to take the risk of being politically condemned, worship the ashes of his best friend, Mr. Zeng Yue, on 11 October 1967, and referred Mr. Huang's poem after 'treating'. Tiba writes: 'I would like to recommend this book to the right, the husband! So landed, so admitted... nothing to say.' And a poem, a poem said: 'In the circulation of the famous poems, according to the frost candlestick shocked, shocked, would it be a different way, so hate forever.' Expressing the sorrow of Mr. chivalry and loss of good friend. 12 years later, January 21, 1979, Fujian Normal University held Professor Huang Zeng-yue Ping and Anti-Zhaoxue Conference, Mr. Sadly Interchange, made two pairs of condolences: 'Hand and foot affliction, unjustified victimization, former wronged relatives pain; death and life, there is grief, today Zhaoxue friends mourn.' Another joint is: 'Injustrated case, hundreds of untold tears; relics are scattered, Jiuquan deep moxibustion.' With Prof. Chen Bingqian's 'A dream of learning fame half a century ago; twelve years later, there is no sadness.' Prof. Huang Shouqi's 'read old years old, dynascent took the papers, see said the former residence, endure wushan to find the bamboo; remember that year, the night for the book of longevity, what period the legacy is not guaranteed, actually taught the left sea to lose dust.' Professor Xu Zongyuan's 'Retirement disease is still robbed; when rain and rain is not seen.' These coupling, written in blood and tears, express the complex feelings that Mr. Qian and his peers have intertwined the mourning and mourning of Mr. Zeng Yue. \\n(5)\\nAt the end of 1953, Fuzhou University canceled the renamed Fujian Normal College. Soon, the former secretary and president of the Party Committee, Lu Weitt, transferred to Xiamen University, by Liu Mingfan, the former Director of Education, to Professor Xiong Deji (later the Chinese Academy of Sciences is the second director of history), as the provost. As a renowned literary historian and educator, Mr. Xiong's idea of running the school: it is important to arrange professors or more of the department's director to attend basic professional courses for newly enrolled undergraduate students. In the autumn of 1954, as an extension of the Department of History and World History, we added the courses of 'Chinese Literature' and 'Foreign Literature'. Mr. Qian Xiu Zhou and Mr. Huang Zeng-yue were assigned to professors in the Department of Chinese; and vice versa., Chinese new students also added 'Chinese History' and 'World History' courses, so as to ensure knowledge The broadening of the surface and the high level of teaching quality; 2 In the case of only ministry teaching syllabus and no unified teaching materials at that time, Provost Xiong was required to prepare teaching materials for students to prepare their own teaching materials for urgent use by students. The Chinese Classical Literature Teaching Group, led by Mr. Qian, immediately launched five professors and gentlemen including Bao Shutang, Huang Shouqi, Yu Un-you and Liu Songqing, formed the 'Chinese Literary Teaching Materials Writing Group' to jointly participate in the preparation of speeches. According to the syllabus requirements, five professors are not stopped and prepared overnight, and Mr. Qian will review all the speeches, two volumes up and down, with about millions of words. Side modification, side lead printing, side issued to Chinese and historical undergraduate students. These two books feature a masterpiece, a broad range of materials, accurate views, very reference and use value. Nearly 60 years have passed, and I am still on the desk and read them at any time, and benefit from them. \\n'Chinese Literature' teaching time is one academic year, 3 hours a week, a morning row, and the next semester are arranged several assignments, and lists the reference books for students to practice; final exams, the assessment of the grades of Mr. M.R. 'Grade Scoring', reflecting Mr.'s adherence to the traditional scoring method. \\nMr. a slender, charity eyebrow, cloth shoes, a attack creaking gray tunic, wearing Phnom Penh flower mirror, amiable, old and heavy, like a scholar style; Mr. is Zhejiang, a strong Jiangzhexiang sound and pure Fuzhou accent, sounds different, kind of natural, close to the teacher and students Psychological distance. Mr. lives in the city, and the annual flower armor, are on time to take the bus to Taijiang, then transfer to the manpower tricycle, walk to Cangshan Chang'an Mountain campus class, never late, sometimes with illness insist, their professionalism is very touched by the students. \\nMr. is extremely concerned about and caring for the students who are enrolled in high school. In my class, there are seven or eight students from workers and farmers, and their cultural base is low. In particular, there are difficulties in interpreting the words and articles of the name as 'Paran Wen'. In addition, they are absent from school because of their duties or illness, Mr. all carefully wrote down their names after enquiries, and agreed time to come to fill their classes from within the city, no. Let fall and keep up with other classmates. My class of more than 40 students, about 2/3 from Minnan, Fujian West, to the summer has the habit of 'beating barefoot'. After seeing, Mr. said to these students: summer red sun, surface moxibustion, in case of showers, barefoot will be hot to attack, cold soaked, causing various diseases. Conscientiously advised students to wear shoes when traveling. These are trivial things, but from subtle points you can see Mr. love for students like nephew. Master style is long. \\nIn short, Mr. Qian Lizhou's life, able in politics, honest, loyal, honest, with the times, love for the people, integrity; from teaching, exhibition group books, rich knowledge, familiar with literature, Seiko poetry, prizes after school, is a fan. This year is the 30th anniversary of Mr. Xian's death. I would like to present this article as a heart in front of Mr. Spirit to express my memory and commemoration of the grace of Mr. Ze.

				"memoirContent": "[Attached] Li Zhenxi: 'Old husband talking about teenage madness'-congratulations on the new wedding of teacher Qian menglongmeng Long (Zhenxi Tea House 2019.4.11)\\nYes, you read it right. What I'm talking about is Tai Dou of contemporary Chinese language education, 87-year-old Qian menglong Menglong teacher this year! \\nA few days ago, Qian menglong told me on WeChat: 'The life of despicable people will have a major change.' Then sent me a document saying, 'It was a statement written by Yao Danhua woman to my children'-\\nDeclarations\\nI have long been engaged in secondary school language teaching. I admire Mr. Qian menglong Menglong's language teaching ideas; I also love the appreciation and writing of classical poetry, I have more common language with Mr.. Recently read Mr. recently came out of the 'Two Negative Xuan Notes', reciting again and again, even more oily, the feeling of hate. See also Mr. widower for many years, empty nest alone, the three children have filial filial, but are scattered, living far away from Mr.'s residence, can not often serve Mr.'s knee, and Mr. former old age, a person living alone, there are many inconveniences and disadvantages. Therefore, after repeated weighing, I decided to be a lifelong partner with Mr., even if it is easy to take care of Mr.'s later life, I can also have more opportunities for consultation, and Mr. Love helps me out of sincerity, and strengthens my confidence in combining with Mr.. However, due to the differences in the age of the two people, it is inevitable to cause all kinds of misunderstanding and speculation, so declared as follows:\\nFirst, my combination with Mr., pure emotional and like-minded combination, not mixed with any utilitarian motivations;\\n2. After marriage, the two parties are economically independent, do not interfere with each other and have questions;\\nThird, Mr.'s only real estate Jiading Qiuxia Apartment Room 202, inherited by Mr.'s three children, I voluntarily renounced inheritance and residency rights. \\nThis statement is made in two copies, one kept by Mr.'s children, one held by himself, and two copies, notarized by the National Notary Office, have the same legal effect. \\nYao Danhua\\nI immediately express my full understanding and sincere congratulations. Qian menglong said: 'I and Danhua sincerely thank you for your understanding and warm congratulations!' \\nI asked, 'Does Teacher Yao also teach secondary school languages?' \\nTeacher Qian menglong replied: 'She is also a language teacher, but due to disappointment with the current education in our country, she has relentlessly resigned and is ready to engage in online writing. She is definitely not a secular woman, which is the emotional basis of my association with her.' \\nThen, Teacher Qian menglong sent me a link to teacher Yao Danhua for a public lecture entitled 'Aesthetics, Sexy, Context', which is about classical poetry. \\nQian menglong also said: 'She was born in 1970, loving literature, quite a bit of extraordinary temperament.' \\nI am delighted: 'Your love is also a beautiful legend!' \\nI speak my heart. \\nI don't know much about Qian menglong's late lady Kang. Many years ago, when I went to the teacher's house, I met teacher Kang, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease (commonly known as 'Alzheimer's disease'), for many years, and saw us very little, but courteous, smiling and nodding me. I know that Teacher Money has been taking care of sick wives for years. \\nIt was about five or six years ago, and I was chatting online with the money teacher. I said, 'What happened to Master Kang?' I am referring to Zhou Yongkang, who was already known to the general public at that time, but the Central Committee hasn't named so the media had not yet stabbed. During that time, Zhou Yongkang used 'Master Kang off the shelf' to allay the fall of Zhou Yongkang. Usually, I and the money teacher often use dark words to talk about sensitive topics. The money teacher who knows that day always responded to agile answers: 'Yes, so recently I'm in a bad mood, but finally finished.' I froze: Zhou Yongkang went wrong, what is the teacher Qian menglong sad? Think about it, he didn't understand my dark words, so I simply said: 'I said Zhou Yongkang.' The teacher understood the money, hurry, sorry and explained that he thought I was talking about the death of teacher Kang. Because he was immersed in sadness during that time, he was very sensitive to 'Kang', and did not carefully look at the words I typed, 'Master Kang' as 'Kang teacher', so misunderstood. \\nIt was also the time I knew that the wife of the teacher of Money died. I don't know how to consolate the money teacher, I can only say 'mourning', although I'm not talking about it. \\nLater I asked the teacher money to give lectures at my school, and he happily agreed. In Chengdu, I accompany Qian menglong teachers in the outskirts of ancient towns to drink tea, talk about education, talk about languages, talk about society... I felt the mood of the money teacher recovered well. The mental state is still young. No, not just a 'mental state,' he likes up his hands like a young man. Looking at the golden rapeseed flowers in the distance, the money teacher moved. My money teacher and I came on foot to cauliflower ground. From the road down, walked through the tianqu, cross the ditch, I hold him from time to time, but the teacher does not want me to help, I am assured, 'My balance ability is very strong, high jump champion at the middle school time!' Sure, he was agile and steady, not like an eighty year old person. Teacher Qian menglong walked straight into the rapeseed flowers, under the golden cluster, money teacher's face bloom a childlike innocent smile. \\nNow that the money teacher regains love, I'm really happy for him. \\nBut I fear that in our country of 'moral supremacy', the remarriage of Teacher Qian menglong Menglong will cause unhappiness for some people. More than a decade ago, the marriage between Liang Jinsong and Fu Mingxia, Yang Zhenning and Weng Fan caused a huge wave. In particular, some still have been 'indignant' to date. I clearly expressed my understanding and support for the combination of Liang Fu and Yang Weng. Remember when I told the students about Lu Xun's Blessing, and talking about 'the old churches kill people, the new churches also kill people', commenting on Yang Zhenning's remarriage as an example:\\n'At the end of last year, public opinion on Yang Zhenning's new marriage was booming. Just because Yang Zhenning and his newlyweds differ in age, there are so many people who say that he violates 'traditional moral'. I think I don't understand what 'traditional morality' he marries someone he loves? Say it! But no one can say it, that is, feel uncomfortable. But I want to say, are you uncomfortable, and others can't live the life they want to live? He was asked when he was interviewed by Yang Zhenning, many people thought women were for your money and worried that you were deceived. He said, I heard another saying that I lied her. He added that since we choose to love and marry, we have enough courage to face public opinion. This matter was fought very badly by the media. It was well known. For a time, many people were distressed and attacked Yang Zhenning on the Internet. This is nothing different from the people who watched and blamed Xianglin Sao. In my opinion, as long as it does not violate the law and does not hinder the life of others, Yang Zhenning has the right to choose his own life! Even if his newlyweds are divorced soon, this is his personal affair! Others have no right to interfere. In fact, there is no difference between the new and the old church, it is the loss of human dignity, the loss of human rights, the loss of human freedom! To break the Church is that people do not live for the rituals, do not live for the face of others, not for the pressure of public opinion!' \\nThe other aspects of Yang Zhenning, such as academic achievements and political positions, have so far different assessments and intense controversy. I do not make a comprehensive assessment of Yang Zhenning. I only express my understanding and support for his remarriage. \\nOver a decade has passed, Yang Zhenning and Weng Fan are still living according to their wishes. This is the progress of the times. \\nHowever, from teacher Yao Danhua's statement, I have vaguely felt some of the concerns of Mr. Yao. The three-point statement seems to reflect teacher Yao's 'noble character'-'not mixed with any utilitarian motives', 'economic independence on both sides,' and 'renunciation of the right to inherit property', but I am not willing to exert these three statements morally. This is only the sincere will of Teacher Yao, and she wants to do so. This is her freedom and right. If, therefore, 'moral praise' to teacher Yao, it actually implied the premise that if he had 'utilitarian motives' and was not willing to 'economic independence between the two sides' or 'give up the right to inherit property', it would be 'immoral' or even 'shameful.' I want to ask, does marriage really exclude 'utilitarian motives'? Does the law recognize and protect the economic rights of both spouses, including the right to inherit property, 'inferior' if they do not give up? Teacher Yao is willing to give up. This is her personal act, and we show respect. But if she does not give up, we should still respect it, which is a normal society. \\nThe line between morality and non-morality is whether their actions hinder others; in other words, as long as they do not hinder others, nothing else is 'immoral.' I think that today's teacher Qian menglong Menglong should not encounter the saliva that Yang Zhenning was verbally abused more than a decade ago? Hopefully so. \\nI said to Qian menglong teacher: 'I force you and teacher Yao!' \\nMore than nine hundred years ago, Su Shi had a word cloud: 'old husband talking about teenage madness...' Su Shi called 'madness', refers to the hunting mania of teenagers. Today I borrow this phrase to describe the mental state of the 87-year-old Qian menglong Menglong teacher, and give the word 'mad' a new solution that meets the characteristics of money teacher-\\nNot bound by the worldly, not tied by earthly, do a real own magnanimous love! \\n9 March 2017"

				"memoirContent": "[Attachment 2] Yi name: 'bitter spicy sweet and sour life-Qian mingqiang legend' (network)\\nRolling the Yangtze River East water, the waves find all the heroes. Is no success or failure turn short: the mountain is still in, a few degrees of sunset red. White hair fishing Qiaojiangzhu, often see autumn spring wind. A pot of cloudy wine meet: many things, all laughter. \\nThis is an ancient word quoted by the opening of the 'Three Kingdoms' famous book of Chinese classical literature and a long history novel, read quite strenuous, even with a little sadness, after reading, really don't have a taste in mind. \\nFrom ancient times, all people who can stand, nothing more than the emperor will, celebrities, heroes, martyrs, and as the main members of the social group-tens of millions of ordinary people, can make up the evangelist really Liao Ruo Morningstar, very little. For the 'elite' of mankind, it is perfectly appropriate, because it can establish a typical spirit of gratitude in the minds of people, enhance national cohesion, and build merit for the nation. But the author always thinks: ordinary see great. Hundreds of millions of ordinary people have an unwritten, inexhaustible life that is more acceptable to the masses and is more universal. In addition, in many ordinary people, their realm, their actions, encounters, performance more than many 'elites' have a flash point, but many writers do not or disdain to find them. \\nIt has been said that life is a novel, not long, but in the good. Einstein added that people can find out the meaning of life that is short and risky only if they are committed to society. And the proletarian revolutionary mentor, Engels, made it even more clear: making a difference is the highest realm in life. \\nFor the above reasons, I relentlessly set aside complex affairs, to make a biography for an ordinary person who has the highest level of life and is full of life significance in his career; this biography, though not long, I am convinced that it is a song of life hymn. \\nHis name is Qian mingqiang. \\n1, change name to stepson\\nLion foothills rolling, seven star wells clean and sweet, a river winding through, the green tree is nestled with a black tile powder wall farmhouse. This is an ordinary village square in the land of Zhejiang Province, called Pengjia. \\nOn June 20, 1935, the cool breeze with a burst of enthusiasm, Peng Mingzhang family came out of a loud baby tea, Xia Jinhua added a boy for Peng's family. Prior to that, Peng's family had two men and two women. The boy ranked fifth, was the three grandfather of Peng's family. Pang Mingzhang, according to his ancestral 'trillion' generation, meditated and eventually named him Peng Zhaochang, whose intention was very clear: the hope that his son would make Peng family thriving in the future. \\nPeng Mingzhang is also a family home in this area. Usually, in addition to their own farming, there are land rental income to sustain their livelihoods. He married a two-room wife room. The former wife had a daughter, named Axiang, and soon went with his hand, and later he continued to marry Madame Harsh. This lady is a famous man, known to be reasonable, not only beautiful, but also very capable, she should be in charge of internal and external affairs at home, handled well. She also has a kind heart. Weekdays, often help people who have difficulties in their lives, never demanding tenants or lower people. As a result, folks were more polite to her after liberation, both during the land reform and even during the cultural revolution. Once a political movement, she was able to spend safely, and that's why she was a man who was a simple and good man. \\nWhen Peng was born, she was only 30 years old, but she was already the mother of five children. In addition to her eldest daughter, she also had older sons Peng Zhaolong, her second son Peng Zhaoqing, and her daughter Peng Dixian. According to the traditional concept of 'more sons, the better' in rural China, the three young grandchildren will undoubtedly become the 'heart and liver baby' of their parents. If Peng Mingzhang could raise the child personally, perhaps the future of the child would be another destiny. Unfortunately, in that kind of years, the Guotai people were not uneasy, natural disasters, soldiers continued, five children were waiting to feed, and their living difficulties were becoming more and more pressured by Pengs and couples. \\n'Golden flower, give Zhaochang to people!' Peng Mingzhang said. \\nXia Jinhua tears like rain: 'The child is the meat falling on the body, and then tired again I will willingly.' \\nBut when Peng Zhaochang was three years old, Mrs. Charles was pregnant again. Peng Mingzhang finally decided to follow Zhaochang to his brother Qian Wenji, who lives in the home home, as his son. Peng Zhaochang has since changed its name to Qian mingqiang. \\nYou home and Pengjia village belongs to Pingyang County Jin Township. June 1981 changed to Cangnan County. Jinxiang ancient called Jinzhou, Ming Hongwu 21 years in the foothills of the lion built city, set up Jin Xiang Wei, to the Japanese Japanese affront. Therefore, the people of this belt are still Wu Chongwen, the city well is bustling, and the mind is more enlightened. Qian mingqiang's adoptive father Qian Wengui is a celebrity in the local area. \\n2, the prestigious money family\\nQian Wenji, also known as Qian Ruixuan, was born on August 20, 1892, that is, Qingguangxu Wang Chenrun on June 28. His father was an authentic farmer in Youjiayuan, his family was poor, never wearing cloth shoes, wearing only grass shoes, sometimes even grass shoes when climbing over the mountains, and walked simply barefoot. Father Qian had two sons, and the eldest son worked with him in agriculture, and put all hope in his younger son Qian Wenguet. 'All kinds of products, only high reading', 'reading officer' concept, deeply rooted in the heart of this honest and hard-working ordinary peasant. Therefore, he will save the money he can use to eat and eat and spend, all for his younger son to go to school. \\nQian Wenji could not afford to hope, from an early age to study very hard, after adulthood in the last batch of students in the Guangxu years. This brings great glory to the whole family and the whole family. Although the Qing Dynasty was quickly replaced by the Republic of the Republic, the enthusiasm of Youjiayuanmen for Qian Wenji was unabated. When the last generation student went to Beiping University again, villagers used the public welfare money received from the Qianjia Anthracite Temple to support him in reading. Of course, these support can only be called a cup of money for a college student, whose main source of life depends on public fees earned because of his excellent performance. But the villagers have never forgotten this kind of hospitality. \\nPeking University has made many great revolutionary pioneers. During his study at this prestigious university, Qian Wenji quickly embraced the idea of progress. He read the law, but both English and Chinese literature were among the best students. He was a proud man of Peking University Chancellor of Mr. Cai Yuanpei. \\nAt that time, the Librarian of Peking University was Mr. Li Dazhao, the pioneer of the proletarian revolution in China, where Comrade Mao Zedong, a great leader of the Chinese people, also served as librarian. He often borrowed progressive books and participated in the May Fourth Movement, which was inseparable from the influence of two revolutionary predecessors on him. \\nAfter graduating from Peking University, he stayed in school to teach. Later on to Guangdong, he was president of the Provincial High Court and professor of the Law Department of Sun Yat-sen University. It was a small and medium-famous left wing of the Kuomintang. After the incident of 4.12 in 1927, his name was unequivocally written on the KMT's right-wing blacklist. \\nLater, he went to the Ministry of Justice of the Nanjing Government. At that time, he met his fellow countrymen, that is Peng Mingzhang's sister, Peng Meile, from acquaintance, know, love each other, to the conclusion of a connection. \\nPeng Meile is a girl in the show Waihuizhong, also a graduate of Peking University, and later worked in Kunshan County Party Department, 11 years younger than Qian Wenji. At first sight, the age gap can no longer be an obstacle to marriage for intellectual women who favored free love. If Qian Wenji had any guilt, it was because of the appearance of Pang Meile, he did not hesitate to divorce his original wife, a rural woman who had too little feet. An ex-wife had a daughter. After they were married, in October 1929 they gave birth to a son named Genser. This is the crystallization of their love, lively and lovely, pampered by their parents, unfortunately died when they reached the age of 3. \\nThe death of his son was a heavy blow to Pommeile. She contracted tuberculosis as a result of excessive grief. This was an incurable disease in China at the time. Qian Wenji was anxious and anxious. When he heard that Shanghai might be governed, he asked the Nanjing government to transfer himself to the Shanghai Special Administrative Region court. He also saw his deep love for his wife. After both husband and wife came to Shanghai, Qian Wenji visited famous doctors. As long as his wife recovered from illness, the debt was too high. He had invited Shanghai's most famous Chinese medicine Fang Shen An, and also let his wife eat the extra-large Changbaishan ginseng sent by Shanghai celebrities Golden Rong. Unfortunately, none to help. On 17 May 1933, the wife left him and was 31 years old. \\nJiao wife love his wife first he went, Qian Wenji, went to Hangzhou Lingyin Temple to ask for a monk. The elders of Lingyin Temple, however, thought that he was not ready to leave home, and advised him to return to his hometown for a temporary rest, in order to adjust his mind. \\nIn this way, the monk should not become, and officials don't want to do so, they return to the family of Jinxiang Yue's parents in Pingyang, that is, Peng Meile and Peng Mingzhang's home. At that time his parents were alive, and his family was wealthy, he was welcome to live. \\nIt was not until Peng Zhaochang followed him as a son, this together returned to Qian's old home. \\n3, adoptive father had saved Lu Ding\\nDuring Qian Wenji as an official, because of his propensity to the revolution, he had done some kind of good word of mouth, two of which were worth adding. \\nAt that time, there were two major events in the Shanghai judiciary, both directly related to Qian Wengui. \\nThe first thing is to rescue seven comrades, Lu Ding, a member of the CPC, from jail. \\nComrade Lu Dingyi returned to his country from Moscow in 1930 as Minister of Propaganda of the Mission's Central Propaganda Department. At that time, the Central Committee of the Mission was located in Shanghai. On January 7, 1931, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Committee of the Communist Party of China was held secretly in Shanghai. As Wang Ming was supported by some people from the Communist International community, he had been pursuing the 'left' adventurist line. As a result, between 1931 and 1934, more than 100 parties and groups in the National Unity Region were severely damaged and a large number of party members were arrested by the Kuomintang. \\nThe atrocities of the KMT have provoked great indignation among protagonists. In December 1932, led by Song Qingling and Mr. Cai Yuanpei, China's Civil Rights Protection Alliance was established in Shanghai and served as the chairman and vice president. The purpose of this progressive group is to protect the democratic rights of the population, to release political prisoners in the country and to oppose the regime of imprisonment, torture and execution that is currently prevalent. They mobilized the upper ranks of cultural and intellectual circles to rescue the arrested revolutionaries. \\nAlthough Qian Wenji is in political circles, he is very dissatisfied with the fascist atrocities of the Kuomintang. Moreover, he was once a grudge student of Mr. Cai Yuanpei, the feelings of teachers and students have been harmonious. He came forward and took advantage of his position and influence in the judiciary, and with the help of all aspects, Comrade Lu Dingyi was finally released. This is certainly laudable to protect China's revolutionary forces. But at that time, he did not think that, in the cultural revolution decades later, he had suffered hard for it until Comrade Lu Ding wrote his own proof for him after the ordinary time, and that was not survived. \\nThe second thing was that a famous capitalist in Shanghai was sentenced to death by a court for serious crimes and was to be executed immediately. Their families, relatives and friends came forward to request Qian Wenji's good offices from it, to suspend the sentence, and to present a senior villa as a gift of gratitude. But no one thought that Qian Wengui rejected it, and the capitalist was executed. From this matter, it is not hard to see his moral integrity and the traditional virtue of Chinese intellectuals that 'wealth cannot be obscene, mighty can not yield'. \\n4. The darling of the money family\\nQian mingqiang, Peng Zhaochang, has been deeply impressed by such a stepfather from a young age. This cannot but impress his future life. \\nEu home, a beautiful village. Surrounded by a flat green rice field, there is a 30 meters wide river to the east, the river flooded with silver water bird sail shadow along with the east flow of water, has been leading to Jinxiang, money bank, Yishan. The place where Qian mingqiang lived was more elegant. He did not live in Qian's old house, but was housed in five new style houses built by his stepfather when he was an official in Nanjing. This was a 'bungalow' at the time. \\nThe stepfather pampered him. He will always love his wife and love his wife, all poured on Qian Ming clang body, regardless of his remuneration, going out, going to Jinxiang, and county cities, all with them, he is really good for him on weekdays. In the year of her stepson's five years old, the father married a divorced woman with the name of Yan, whose appearance was not worthy of praise. But at this time, Qian Wengui has completely lost the fashion of that year, not only not bad for her, but also treated her well. This Yan's later gave birth to four daughters, which was not a good thing for the feudal consciousness of the countryside at that time. So when she gave birth to her fourth daughter, she conspired with the doctor who gave birth and changed a boy with the other man. Only this boy also has a lot of fate. When he grows up, he can't be able to read or do work, and the villagers call him '250' and has been still working in Yujia's farm. \\nAs a result, Qian mingqiang is increasingly in the special status of 'under one person, above all people' at home. During dinner, Qian mingqiang and his father sat on a table alone, and the dishes were invited to cook at home; while Yan's daughters ate at the kitchen table; and some permanent workers and maids could only eat big bursts in the back hall. At that time, Qian Wenji had savings, economic situation was good, mountain seafood, North and South goods, all kinds of drinks could be called everything. Therefore, Qian mingqiang learned to drink alcohol from an early age, and meals are constant. His father did not smoke, and he did not learn to smoke. \\nOf course, many of the advantages of Qian Wengui in the long-term shared life of the father and son are inherited by his son. Qian Wenji understood the law. At that time many famous barristers were his students, there were many guests in and out of the country. Most of them were social celebrities at the time, doing great things for the country. Qian Wenji also understands medicine. This is the result of studying medical books and medicine books day and night in order to improve his wife's condition during his illness, Peng Meile. After returning to his homeland, he was obliged to visit his folks to see a doctor, so that Qian mingqiang also fell in love with the doctor's practice, and in the aftermath it became a good doctor known from far and near. Many poets and painters in society at that time were friends of Qian Wenji. He also often taught his son to understand the importance of classical poetry and classical literature to Tao Yizhi, which was an enlightening role for Qian mingqiang to Chinese classical literature. In his future life, writing classical poetry became a reality. He feels current affairs, relying on the good means of love. \\nThus, as the father of the head of the family, his habits, hobbies, character, upbringing and interest on the child can not be underlooked. \\n5, from childhood is called 'prodigy'\\nQian mingqiang grew up slowly under such favorable conditions. His mind, wisdom and knowledge have given the impression of any kind of 'crane chicken' from an early age. \\nVillage has not yet graduated, he read 'Three Kingdoms', 'Water Margin', 'Journey to the West' and other famous Chinese classical literature. Whenever the night falls, folks come to the money home, listen to him to tell his story, his intonation, wonderful episodes, often make the audience mesmerized, late Beken leave. His memory is particularly strong, 'Water Margin' 120 back to the catalog, 108 will the name, nickname, turned out to be ripe. \\nHe learned poetry from an early age, and was aesthetic. Also at the age of 11, a teacher Shi, who taught drawings, created a painting with the sun, chick, violet, he once bravely asked a poem on the above, actually won the great praise of the teacher. Unfortunately, the whole poem has been forgotten, which only remember 'autumn and cool days, when the chick was born' and other sentences, it is not difficult to see his talent. \\nThe folks boast him, saying that he is a 'prodigy', and there must be a difference in the future \\nEat the mountain empty, this word is not false. Because of Qian Wenji's poor financial management and reluctance to manage money, the family road slowly began to decline. At that time, he regularly visited the folks, and he was advised to collect some medical fees to supplement his livelihood, but he shook his head and resolutely not to collect money. At the end of 1942, given his knowledge and prestige, he was hired to serve as the principal of the Kangshan Primary School, and the whole school was organized by him, but he did not receive a single salary. Originally, the family can also rely on collecting land rents to maintain a living, but he often holds a senseless attitude, and the tenant can receive, and can not receive it. For these, the local elderly people still remember fresh, saying that Qian Wenji is a humane man who treats people generous and selfish interests. As a result, he did not fight in the post-liberation land reform campaign. And his wife Yan is absolutely different. His wife does not treat people very well on weekdays, is very thin for tenants, increases rent, and has a high profit loan, and is also not good in private life, and has an ambiguous relationship with the helpers who manage the granary. As a result, the folks were very inferior to her, and hated her. When the land reform, they fought her hard. \\nThe money family is losing, and the good life of the past is gone. Worn clothes began to appear in Qian Wengui's body. But despite that, his prestige remains. In 1944, he was hired as a national teacher at Binh Duong Simple Normal School. \\nPingshi was founded in the spring of 1944, closed in May 1949. In just six years, we have experienced two historical phases of the war of resistance against Japan and the war of liberation. At that time, he provided the children of poor families with the opportunity and place to study for free. He also trained a group of young people with certain cultural knowledge for the revolution and construction of the new China. So the founding of the Pingsho has a positive significance in history. \\nQian Wenji's work for people during this period has also been recognized by the local people. On page 40 of the fifth series of Cangnan literature, published in December 1989, there is such a paragraph: 'The Chinese teacher Qian Wengui was a judge of the High Court, later discouraged the official field, spent a period of time in an antenang life, while hired to teach, still care about the growth of students. In the winter of 1947, Lin Jie, graduating student Lin Jie, in his essay on the graduation exam proposition 'Memories of my alma mater', revealed and criticized the dark society. Teacher Qian praised the teacher Qian and said to the graduating student Zhang Zhiyi: 'Lin Jie's article is smooth and indeed well written, but if it comes to the top, Lin Jie does not look. But not to graduate, fear political guilt. Because money teacher did not do this, Lin Jie was safe and graduated...'\\nIt is not difficult to find from this record that Qian Wengui is still tending to progress in the years of white terror. This can also be seen from the book collection in his home at that time. Revolutionary books such as Mao Zedong's 'New Democracy Theory', 'On the United Government', Aiqi's 'Popular Philosophy', Stalin's 'On Historical Materialism', Marx's 'Capitalism' and so on, at that time, such books were afraid to enter the house without courage. \\nAt that time, Qian mingqiang, who had already accompanied his father to attend grade 1, also took the opportunity to read these books, but it seemed to understand it. But the influence of these books on him cannot be ignored, not only allowed him to take part in the revolution soon after liberation, but also to prepare for later teaching political classes in schools. \\n6. Disruption of academic studies\\nGong and gum, firecracker Qiming, in May 1949, Pingyang County liberated. \\nPrior to this, Shandong University and Qingdao University had sent letters to hire Qian Wenji to teach. But at this time he has been nearly a flower, the idea of 'leaf fall back to the root' is deeply entrenched, preferring to die in his hometown and not to go out. Later could not withstand the repeated recruitment and economic constraints of Qingdao University, he moved, so he said goodbye to colleagues and family members on the road. \\nWhen he was still halfway, Yu's home was liberated. \\nQian mingqiang, 15 years old, is the only male to stay in the Chin family. Early in the morning of this day, several local armed comrades came, and he hacked his head and said, 'Give your house guns out!' \\nQian mingqiang was lying and looked at the Red House Dream and immediately stood up: 'I never saw my father had a gun.' \\nThey said, 'Qian Wenji was an official in the KMT government. Why didn't you have a gun? It is an offence to hide a firearm.' \\n'My father was a civil servant, and there was no gun in the civilian house.' He answered. \\nSeveral comrades saw that he was young and could not ask, so they asked him to write a letter and call his father back. \\nThe letter was not written, but Qian Wenji came back soon. He finally failed to give up his wife and children, and went to his relatives home half the way and stayed for a stay, relinquished his appointment as a university professor and turned home. There is indeed no gun at home. In addition, he usually has good people, the local government has not had any difficulty for him. It was only rated as a bureaucratic landowner component and implemented a rent cut, and Qian mingqiang was still studying at that time, and the personal component was students. \\nThe flat division stopped doing so. The vast majority of ungraduated students go to Binh Duong Secondary School to continue their studies. A month later, Qian mingqiang, who was excited by the entire revolutionary situation, insisted that they should be enrolled in the army, but neither parents agreed. First, they were still young, and the second was that he had a smart son at home, how would he be willing? But the son has lost interest in reading. \\n'Then get a job!' The father said. \\nIn October this year, he went to Dayu Elementary School to teach, because his father also coached there, and could teach him herself. In other words, Qian mingqiang started to work since the age of 16. From this point on, what will be shown in front of him will be a changing life. \\n7, hazy first love\\nThe big fishing village faces the East China Sea, beautiful scenery and pleasant climate. The story of 'rural female teacher', the ideal of Peach Li full of the world, made Qian mingqiang work very well, his cheerful face also gradually matured. \\nIn addition to Qian Wenji, this primary school has a teacher who teaches fine arts, Lin Bingwen, who was originally his students; she taught young female teachers, called Zhang Xueying, who was long fat, and a female teacher named Yang, just over the age of 18, grew up and moved by bodybuilding. In the early days of liberation, primary schools with four teachers were considered to be strong teachers. So their school is full of vigor and more than enough to teach. Once idle, Qian Wenji often taught several teachers to do pairs, conjunctions, poems, and poems, among which the worst did was the girl Yang, and the best done was the money Mingqiang, because he was young by his father's stiffness, thinking agile, and each was the best. So, he often opened a 'small stove' for Xiao Yang and went privately to help her. \\nIn inadvertently frequent contact, the teenager who read 'Dream of the Red House' began to love her in hazy. Together they prepare lessons, discuss lesson plans, go to the beach for a walk, see the tide of the big fishing bay, facing the sea, and Ren wave to them. They watched the smoke and a little white sail, until the afterglow of the sunset gave them light. He favorite the rising eyebrows, in the light of the moonlight, double shadow Tingting, the girl seems so soft, so Chu, really beautiful than flowers, because flowers do not understand, and she can interpret words. As long as Qian mingqiang is with her, she will feel joyful, fulfilling, happy, and hated time too fast. Young girl often likes eyebrow, face from time to time fly off a bright red cloud, Qian mingqiang compared her to her sister Lin. Sometimes he treats her as a treasure sister, because she is three years older than him, and is so dignified, so good understanding. In the face of this beautiful woman, he looks somewhat mesmerized and will quietly gaze at her and bless her silently. \\nAfter all, it is the early teenager, in the heart often want to kiss her, kiss her. But when this impulse appears, timid also takes up his mind without losing time, not to get close to her, even to pull her hand dare. He was afraid to offend each other because she was so holy, so pure. In the days he couldn't see her, he seemed irritable and restless...\\nHe finally took the courage to tell his father all this feeling, told him that he fell in love with Xiao Yang, hoping to get his father's support and promised to keep them together forever. \\nQian Wenji is wise. He told his son very decisively: 'First, you are too young, 16 years old people are not likely to start home; second, young young is older than you, poor health, and has tuberculosis, this disease is currently difficult to cure; third, after starting a career, after you grow up there is a chance...'\\nQian mingqiang's pure, hazy and brief first love ended, leaving only good memories for him. \\n8, join the revolution\\nHe has since been actively working and learning hard. In early 1950, the 16-year-old, who performed well in all respects, became the first group of members of the New Democratic Youth League in Jinxiang district. The group book in the time zone was called Yang Bingzheng, and later became a famous painter. After entering the regiment, he was transferred to the district office, and since then left the Grand Fishing Primary School, left his father, and also left Xiaoyang, and invested in the revolution with enthusiasm. \\nIn 1950, the rural policy was to rectify land, then reduce rent and cut interest rates before land reform. After Qian mingqiang reported in the district, he followed the District Committee Secretary Ma Benru around to learn about the situation and guide his work, so that he learned a lot of practical work experience. At that time, cadres were very young and energetic, working almost all day until late at night, but no one was tired; life on weekdays was also very hard, coarse tea, sometimes eaten up, didn't go down, but no one shouted bitter. This mental style was greatly infected with Qian mingqiang. At that time, Qian mingqiang's grandfather had gone away. What appeared in front of people was a tiger and tiger angry and young working comrade. \\nIn just four months, he was transferred to Yanting Township as head of the soil working group and equipped with a gun, in view of his performance and capabilities. \\nAlthough it is a township, in the complex political environment of the early liberation period, the struggles before him are extremely intense, banditry, harassment by the sea, rumors continue, and the hearts and minds of the people are unstable. Can Qian mingqiang's tender shoulders bear this heavy burden? According to his heart, although he was full of pride, but often in his heart, he could only screw the only hand into a rope, in the heavy work hundred times increased vigilance, lest being subjected to class enemy reckoning. \\nOne day, they caught a fleeing bully and tied him with a rope to the table of an ancient temple. In the evening, he and another cadre were guarded by him and two militia posts at the doorway. Late at night, tired, they all fell asleep unwittingly. Suddenly 'flutter' a sound, immediately woke up the money Ming clang, it turned out that bully escaped from the rope and jumped off the table. He immediately caught a gun and chased, and the bully seized the knife of the station militia at the doorstep, and wanted to commit a crime. But the gunfire was ringing, and the bully knew that he could not run away, and cut it to his throat with a knife, so that they moved quickly and immediately subjugated him. \\n'It's dangerous, if it's a little later, we could be killed or injured!' Qian mingqiang took a breath. The bully died later due to excessive bloodshed. \\n5 km away from the mountain of Yanting Township, a place where bandits are haunted, they burned and looted without evil in order to interfere with the territorial movement that has destroyed the people's power. At that time, the Working Group did not have a radio station, no telephone, and when it found hostile, it could only rely on two legs to send letters to its superiors. Qian mingqiang is yo"

He has often received praise and praise from his superiors and colleagues because of his dynamic and vigorous revolutionary work. Had he not been implicated in the issue of his father's political history, he would have no future. \\n9, everywhere hit the wall\\nIn 1951, the township anti-movement in the liberated areas was fully spread out, and the anti-revolutionaries, landlords, bullies and bandits who were grappling with hatred of the people's regime were the first batch of lands to be suppressed. Qian Wenji, who was a senior official in the KMT, was also arrested as a historical counter-revolutionary and held in the district government. Later after a public trial, the people's court sentenced to death for two years. One of the biggest charges was that he had persecuted Communist Party members while serving as an official in Shanghai. \\nQian Wenji categorically denied that the crime was a fact, lodged a complaint and wrote in prison to Comrade Lu Dingyi, who was then the central leader, asking to testify. 'Realistic truth' is a good tradition for communists. A year later, it was certainly confirmed by Comrade Lu Ding, not only did not kill Communist Party members, but also made great efforts for the release of seven comrades in prison. The People's Government immediately released Qian Wenji and placed him at the rural health centre of his home. \\nThe negative effects of fathers' historical counter-revolutionary identity were quickly revealed. The first hit is Qian mingqiang, who was mobilized to withdraw. Qian mingqiang can't figure out how, and repeatedly argued: birth is not a choice, and the future depends on his own choice. He chose the revolution, he loves the Communist Party, loves the New China. He works actively, strives to transform his ideas, and face the harsh environment that can give his life at any time, he is fearless because it is his only ideal! \\nIn the era of class origin, in the storm like land reform and anti-town movements, this argument is obviously useless. He was eventually mobilized to withdraw from the regiment and left the Working Group helplessly. Without a job, he will not work in agriculture, he began to go on the horizon, wanted to find a job. \\nHe went from Jinxiang to Ruian, then took a boat to Wenzhou, and went back to Oujiang to Lishui, then take a car to Jinhua, and then took the train to Shanghai Fenglin Bridge. Yan's mother's brother, also his uncle, works here in the Physiology Department of Shanghai Second Medical College. Although he was properly received, but after two days he was told: the boss was idle, his family could not afford, or went to Suzhou to find a big sister to think about it! \\nThis older sister, the daughter of Qian Jia Lin's mother, she lives with her husband in Suzhou after she was married. Big Sister Qian family did not like him, and the reason is very simple. Her mother was forced to divorce because her father and his aunt were forced to divorce. In addition, since Peng Meile married to his father, and Qian mingqiang went to the Qian family, the father was gracious to him, and the money of the money was all over to the Peng family. too. \\n'Also,' big sister Qian said: 'Father should go to college to teach, why prefer to stay in his hometown and ask for hardship!' \\nJudging the situation, it seems that this sister's family is also difficult to establish. Chen Jijian, the mechanic's brother-in-law, was reasonable: 'Again, it's also his brother, or stay!' \\nSo, Big Sister Qian assigned him a job: waiting for a little nephew. But the Chen family's 'heart and liver baby' is not so good to wait. In addition to buying this for him, he has to hold him every day, play with him, once unhappy, cry. Big Sister Qian is often indiscriminate, saying that he bullied his little nephew and even wronged him to steal something from his little nephew. This kind of day, for a young man, is really unbearable, but can't bear how to do it? Where can he go? He can only endure it again and wait for the time. If the troubled fate he suffered later can be sustained by him at a time, it should be said that it has no relationship with the 'patience spirit' that has been cultivated during this time. \\nThe opportunity has finally come. A department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is recruiting civil arts corps in Suzhou. He passed the exam and was admitted for his appearance, body and understanding. How happy he is! However, the troops have regulations that must obtain a certificate of residence from the local government in order to formally enrol in the army. He is a foreigner who came to join his relatives and friends. He can only sigh at the ocean. \\nIn fact, there was no account at that time, it was impossible to find any job. He had tried to go to the school, and he could still be allowed to study as long as he was able to do so with a certain certificate of 'residence'. He was admitted to Tiger Hill High School. Where did the tuition fees come from? If you want to pull out money from the big sister of the Chin family, it's harder than Deng He then went to the teacher training school, which was entitled to the First Class People's Bursaries. But this time, because there are too many people who apply for the examination, he could not break through the competition of a strong hand like Lin, and at that time the door of the teacher teacher was open to poor students. His family origin itself was an insurmountable threshold. \\nBig Sister Qian family is getting more and more dissatisfied with him, scolding him every day, scolding him for nothing, scolding his father for suffering, and scolding Peng family to drag the money Ecological cold, human love like paper, he took his own broken suitcase gone, even to his better brother-in-law there did not say hello. Of course, Big Sister Qian family was forced to ask for a tricycle, and must help pay the fare. Qian mingqiang's head twist: 'I have money myself, do not help you!' Until this time, the eye of the big sister of the Qian family flushing up, seems to have a bit of intransigence in conscience, revealing a touch of affection. \\nOpen the bow without turning back arrows, he went firmly. There is indeed some winding around, that is when he left the home of Youjia, Yan's mother gave him 20 yuan, and when he left Jinxiang, Xia's mother gave him more than 10 yuan. To Ruian, his brother Peng's family made more than 10 yuan, plus 40 yuan. \\nHe went back to Shanghai from Suzhou and went again to find Uncle Yan. Uncle did not scold him, but said clearly: 'I can't feed you. You stay for a few days, I help you find a job!' \\nA few days later, the job found: the laboratory building of the Shanghai First Medical College where he went to the uncle to teach as a porter, that is, a small worker. The specific work is to help carry a variety of bodies during the day for experiments, flush all kinds of utensils, and can go to night school at night. \\nIt should be said that this is a very good job. If Qian mingqiang did that at that time, and in decades, perhaps became a professor of physiology, it would be another life. But he was reluctant at that time. How can a person who has been deeply educated from an early age to be a small worker who listens to the call? 'It's a great flock! This is actually a shortcut to the Hall of Knowledge!' Qian mingqiang mentioned this matter still regrets. \\nWhen the uncle saw him not to stay, he was advised to go back to Binh Duong and wrote a letter asking him to hand him over to the Director of Education in Pingyang County, hoping to find a suitable job for his nephew. \\nIt was the letter that brought him back to the educational front, and thus deduced a new life of life. \\n10, return to the primary teaching post\\nThe Director of Education of Pingyang County, a person of great friendship, received a letter of recommendation from Professor Yan, and the shortage of teachers at that time, soon arranged him to serve as general affairs director of Caobao Primary School in the eighteenth Duu Old District, teaching language and music. This was in October 1950. Qian mingqiang was 17 years old. \\nOld district folk style simple. Liu Ying, first secretary of the Communist Party of China's Zhejiang Underground Provincial Committee, conducted revolutionary activities here. After liberation, the poor children were able to read, so they showed great enthusiasm and welcome to the teachers who came to the party. After a long career, Qian mingqiang also secretly expressed his ambition: we must contribute wholeheartedly to the cause of education in the new China and will not live up to the expectations of the Party and the people! \\nSure to do it. Qian mingqiang took his work very seriously and responsibly, but also with his excellent literary and artistic talent, actively cooperated with the current affairs education of the situation at that time, compiled blackboard newspapers, singing materials, and performing literary performances as directors. The whole primary school showed a dynamic situation. \\nIn the transforming movement, he is more active, motivated and even radical. The most telling of the problem is that he publicly reported that he had separated from his father-son relationship with the historical counter-revolutionary father Qian Wenji. Of course, this act of 'decimation' is inseparable from the education, thought, and the dogma they received at that time; but it still drove colleagues and county education circles for a while. Thanks to his 'ruthless' practice, the money family rightly cut off all financial assistance to him. \\nAt that time, there were over 100 primary school teachers in the commune, of whom more than 20 were teaching the language of the upper secondary school either self-study or correspondence. Qian mingqiang only read the second grade in Ping Shi, and consciously seized his spare time to study pedagogy, cardiology and pedagogy. Due to his high understanding, he quickly grasped the teaching theories he had never been exposed to in the past, and was asked to serve as a teacher and counselor in high school correspondence classes to teach teachers who could not even attend a junior high school remedial class. \\nHe began to be complacent, believing that he was also a personal figure in the primary school teachers at that time. He was not satisfied with the primary education career, he went to the Shanghai East China Normal University. When the two consecutive years of application had fallen out, it was still unwilling, and the third year was finally able to pay for it, he took it, but he did not eventually report. Although the people's bursaries were available to study higher teachers at that time, the cost of living had to be self-cared for. It was impossible to expect family support. In the long four years, where did this cost come from? It is really 'a money to death hero', he calmed down, began to face reality, on the one hand through self-study to improve himself, at the same time still hard work, strive to make some achievements in the elementary teaching post. \\nDuring this period, his work changed several times. 'Sesame blossom festival high', in 1952, was transferred to Meixi Central Primary School as teaching director. This primary school has junior high school classes, commonly known as 'hats high school', and conditions are better in all aspects. Due to the needs of work, he was reassigned to Gyeongquan Elementary School, which was more difficult in 1953 as temporary head, and he was happy to go. \\nHe was once again trusted by the leadership and the masses. In 1955, when the anti-insurgency movement, he was the head of the group, in order to cooperate with the work of the commune government, paved the night on his back, write slogans, perform performances, and traverse every village. After learning about his performance, uncle Yan Jia Shanghai was very happy, and he made a solemn warning: to be 'safe and dangerous', we must not be complacent. Qian mingqiang wrote down as his motto. \\nIt is because of his strict demands that he has done well in all areas, and in 1956 he was officially appointed head of Gyeongquan Elementary School. He was 22 years old that year. \\n11, another woman broke into his heart\\nAlthough the environment of this primary school is much worse than Meixi Elementary School, the building was only converted from an old temple. But he was so young as the head of a school, he could also be called a 'teenager will.' Together with his gentle and elegant, able to speak, talented, his heart has been closed since the hazy first love, and was knocked off by a young woman. \\nThis time, even he himself did not know whether this affection was love. He was again subjected to an unprepared robbery and almost smashed the 'rice bowl' as well. \\nThe number of women at Gyeongquan Elementary School has a beautiful female teacher who was familiar with him in the past and very active, so contact with each other is extremely frequent. At that time there was a female teacher's dormitory near the head office and bedroom, while the rest of the teacher's dormitories were far away from the old theater. The dormitory in the next dormitory is exactly the familiar and beautiful female teacher. \\nIt is a natural, delicate and thoughtful woman. On weekdays, the principal took care of his life, and he changed his clothes and took it clean immediately; she also burned good dishes and often cooked some delicious side dishes to give him wine. Qian mingqiang did not go at the beginning, often said: 'You always take care of me like this, really sorry, let me do these things myself!' \\n'You work so busy, and a big man alone, colleagues should take care of each other!' She said. \\nFor a long time, Qian mingqiang also acquiesced into acquiescence, and once acquiesced to it, it Two people in and out, said laughing, when not together, both sides will have a sense of loss. When a female teacher is 25 years old and 22 years old, it is the season of youth, and things inevitably happen. \\nIt was a month after Qian mingqiang was appointed principal. Typhoon rainstorms hit the coastal area of Zhejiang, and the wind is above level 10. Jingquan primary school is originally a dilapidated temple, rains outside, rain inside, and leaks everywhere. The principal had a room and her dormitory was not able to stand at all. Only the group office had a small piece of space, and they ran there to hide the rain. The dark night, whistling storms, caused a great panic to the female teacher, she snuggled him unconsciously, he also clung her tightly. Two young heterosexual colleagues are so combined, in this unbridled night. \\nImmersed in the happiness of the first forbidden fruit, Qian mingqiang forgot that he was the head of a school and ignored one more crucial thing: the female teacher had worn her wedding dress three years ago, but he was facing a couple. \\nIf they do not wash their hands, they may not affect each other's future. But this kind of thing is very difficult to control, and a rejoice was finally discovered by the superiors. It is the saying: 'If people do not know, unless they do nothing.' A year later, he was seriously punished: he was removed from his position as principal and removed from the school. That was the beginning of 1957. \\nThe loving money still feels deeply guilty: he not only affects himself, but also inflicts heavy mental stress on each other. After the two people left, he never met, he can only bless her in his heart: I hope that she is happy and better than him. \\n12, doom suddenly came\\nIn view of his outstanding achievements in teaching and teaching, he was transferred back to Meixi Central Primary School and continued to serve as a teaching director and a language teacher in the Junior High School. Since his articles were well written, the Teachers newspaper appointed him as editor and correspondent. As a result, he quickly became a leader in the local education community. \\nGood view is not long. In the spring of 1957, when the anti-right movement carried out in intellectual and literary circles, after about a year of stormy Xian Li, began to spread to the field of elementary education. His life lanes began to reverse sharply. \\nOne day in the first half of 1958, the whole campus was covered in large print newspapers, and the content written above, without exception, was to expose money Mingqiang. 'Qian mingqiang, the filial son of the bureaucratic landlords,' 'Qian mingqiang, a corrupt life,' and 'anti-socialist Qian mingqiang, anti-socialist Qian mingqiang'... Many of the charges have come out like the rain. \\nAt the same time, cooperative campaigns are being carried out in rural areas. It is a cry that he was drawn to serve as the team leader of the Cooperative Focus Group. He was actively teaching farmers about the advantages of cooperation and the related policies. \\nOn 13 July, the weather was hot and breathless. The village came to notice: to hold a live meeting of the whole township in the village, township cadres, village cadres and primary school teachers all have to attend. Qian mingqiang is very happy, and even somewhat happy. This shows that the cooperative sneakers in the village have been carried out very well, only the village will choose this village as a typical. \\nAt lunch, the secretary of the Communist Party Committee came to him. \\n'You write the material right away!' Speak open the door to the mountain. \\n'How do cooperative campaigns be carried out?' \\n'No, write yourself how anti-socialist crime!' The answer was straight away. \\nLike a blue bolt, he was shocked, pale face, shaking, nothing said, with his understanding, knowing that it was not useful. A doom that could not be saved by manpower finally came to his head. After the conversation, the first thing he did was to quickly write a letter to his mother, Mrs. Charles. \\nThis is actually a letter that arranges for yourself. When he started working, the monthly salary was only 12.5 yuan, later increased to 33 yuan, and finally mentioned 47.5 yuan. He was able to raise his salary at this rate over the course of seven years also shows his outstanding performance in all areas. As his age progressively grew, he began to accumulate a portion of his money on a planned basis for the future use of married families. Although he was alone, he was also very expensive, and in order to facilitate control, he sent the money for each repayment of his salary to the mother and asked her to store it on his behalf. There are more than 300 yuan a few times. This was not a small sum at the time. Now that doom came, the money was his only source of life in the future, so he told the birth mother in his letter and asked her to keep the money in any case and to do confidential work. \\nThis evening, the scene will no doubt turn into a batter. People were crowded with slogans, and the speaker was generous and passionate, and had repeatedly denounced money, the anti-socialist anti-socialist anti-people right-wing, anti-socialist anti-people. He presided over the meeting was secretary of the Communist Party Committee. In summing up, he righteously demanded that money Mingqiang must honestly confess guilt and plead guilty. Otherwise, it would never end well! \\nThe hats of the right were put on so easily. \\nHis crimes are extremely serious:\\nTo slander the great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong. The fact is that there is an article by Chu Anping in the Education Newspaper. After reading, he once said, 'Chu Anping is so dare to give advice to Chairman Mao. However, the secretary of the school group who exposed him said that Qian mingqiang, after reading this article, clapped his hands quickly and praised Chuanping for his courage. \\nOppose one-party dictatorial rule. The fact is that he did not object at that time, but in consultation with opinions, he said some of his own opinions about the division of work between the mayor and the secretary of the Communist Party Committee. Some people put this up to an attempt to weaken the party's leadership and oppose one-party dictatorship. \\nRejection of democratic centralization. In one year, when the candidate was elected, a quota was set in the prefecture for those who had just returned from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He did say at that time: whether it was premature. \\nMovement against socialist cooperation. When engaging in cooperation, their village was a typical transformation from a low-level society to a higher society, and the whole township had the best, and at once they were fully spread out. And he himself had done an excellent achievement in that regard, both in the village and the village at that time. Only on an occasional occasion, he had reminded the leaders that in the absence of keeping up with the ideological work of peasants, the Higher Society had spread out at once and should pay attention to the 'big end'. This is entirely good intentions. \\nOppose Sino-Soviet friendship. That's because in the early 1950s, our country imported a large amount of cloth into the Soviet Union, and because it was not sold out, men were mobilized to wear clothes everywhere. He said, 'How can this be dressed out.' After I forgot, I didn't expect someone to repeat the old words, became a political problem...\\nThere are many more crimes, and Qian mingqiang is now hard to recall. But he remembered clearly so far that when the Communist Party Secretary announced these counts, he was surprised: how could he commit so many crimes overnight? And most of the things are nothing, infinite outline, misinterpretation, out of context. Their attitude is good, it is also difficult to accept ah! He therefore repeatedly argued that it was unacceptable. \\nNot accepted must also be accepted. Just two hours will determine his painful career for the next 22 years. After being put on a hat, the surrounding people don't know him overnight. On the road, friends and colleagues met, don't turn their body pretending not to see; there are some unfamiliar children, throwing mud and stones at him, and they shouted in the mouth: 'The right, the right, the great evil of the people!' He was so painful at that time, hated his heart straight, and said a few words that should not be said, only to get the point where people were discarded. After many years, he learned that the hat of the right was decided to be assigned to him because of the lack of quotas for the right in the commune at that time. This is, of course, extremely closely related to his bad birth. \\nHe can no longer engage in the sacred work of the Human Soul Engineer. He was left in school to supervise his labor, the main task being to clean the toilet. \\n13, a pair of bitter yuanyang\\nHis birth mother, Mrs. Charles, was a strong rural woman. When she learned that her son was wearing a right-wing hat, she did not think about the future of her son a few twists, but she just wanted to help her son find an object and get home, so that there was a woman around her son to take care of. So, she went to the west, visited relatives and friends, and finally looked for him to find her girl Song Xiaoxian-his good wife who had always been in the wind and rain, misery and good Yin Sook. \\nSong Xiaoxian's component is the urban poor, the root is miaohong, and in the era of class composition is dependent on the object. Unfortunately, because of the large number of children in the family and the unusually difficult life, her father, who was a primary school teacher in her early years, left her home and went to Taiwan to earn a living. It was unfortunate that she could not afford to be sick, leaving her home home wife and four children in a more difficult situation. \\nSong is dependent on small labourers or small businesses to sustain their lives. Elder daughter Song Aixian, barely finished junior high school and dropped out of school at home. Help the mother to support the home together. The second daughter, Song Xiaoxian, read only primary school and could no longer study anymore, and also stayed at home as a mother's helper. Three daughters Song Xianxian could only marry a farmer early and went to work in agriculture. The youngest is the son, named Principal Song. When he was born nine days, his father went to Taiwan. So far, he doesn't know what his father looks like, but he knows that Dad wants to make his family live a little better before going to earn a living. \\nSuch a poor home is supported by a mother alone. She also wanted to die several times, but when she thought of her own hands, the sons and daughters were desperate, and how would they spend the day? 'Poor parents heart,' for the sake of the child, she bitten her teeth and survived, and warmed this impending home with the brilliance of her mother's love; the children also know their hearts, take care of each other, and make the family a smooth and smooth with the most precious affection in the world. \\nIn the summer of 1958, Qian mingqiang returned to Jinxiang. At that time, he had swept the romantic mood of the past, became reality. He thought: As long as Song Xiaoxian is able to match herself, he has no reason to disagree with her. And in fact,When the two people meet,He simply did not believe in his eyes,Ting Ting Jade in front of her girl turned out to be so dignified, generous, bodybuilding, he not only felt very satisfied, but worried that the girl would not be in the same way. Of course, he also knows that although he is not a small white face, but also looks handsome, personable, the average girl will love it. But in that era of class and politics, will the other party refuse it? At that time, he was only secret about his own political issues, in the light of his fate. Fortunately, children of poor families rarely think about this problem, and she is also at first sight. 'She is my life blessing, especially the virtues she showed in my adversity, which makes me never forget!' Qian mingqiang has said this more than once. \\nHaving engaged, Mrs. Xia thought that her son was an intellectual, mobilized Song Xiaoxian to go to Ruian to study agricultural secondary school. to improve your culture without paying expensive tuition fees. The two agreed: National Day to marry. \\nOn October 1, 1958, Qian mingqiang finally got married. The location is located in Ryan. Because his brother of Peng's family, Zhaolong worked at the Ruian Brewery, he was arranged by his brother. Song Xiaoxian is studying in the farm. Without a marriage room, Peng Zhaolong temporarily borrowed a distant relative, Qian mingqiang called her uncle's room for a new house. \\nFortunately, Qian mingqiang has predicted that the original existence of more than 300 yuan of money from the birth mother makes this marriage not too cold. He used a part as a bride price for the Song family, added several new clothes to the Xian, and bought a wool blanket. This way, of course, can not do, only in the big brother to eat a more hearty meal than usual, it is a wedding banquet. \\nThe wedding night is always exciting. In the face of a dignified, simple wife, Qian mingqiang seems to have matured a lot at once. He felt that he had a family and head of the family, and henceforth he had the duty to care for his wife and the duty to bear the burden of the family. Although the two have not undergone the process of knowing and falling into love under the month before the flowers, are they not all married first and then in love for thousands of years in China? Women in China are meek and wise, and Chinese men have a sense of family and responsibility. In the face of the bride, staring at her crystal clear eyes, Qian mingqiang felt unparalleled happiness, endless satisfaction. But a slightest of guilt was born, 'I am young, robust and versatile, but I, I am...' He finally took the courage to put his right hat out to his wife and pallets. \\nThis festive wedding night. It is tantamount to casting a shadow. The wife covered her face cried, and he was overshadowed. 'I love you, I will love you all my life, regardless of the situation, I will do a husband's responsibility, take care of you, treat you well, will not live up to you! Today, our shabby wedding is a grievance to you, but I'm still young, as long as I live, someday, I will compensate you!' His words, almost spell, swear, although it was to comfort his wife, but it was indeed a confession from the heart. He could not have imagined that, in the long years of 'class struggles' that followed, he thought that, as long as he worked hard and actively reformed, the right 'hat' would soon be removed, and the future still had a good future. Until more than 30 years later, when Qian mingqiang put a ring with Thai chicken blood ruby on his wife's hands, he took a long breath when he put a precious mink coat on her shoulder: 'I finally fulfilled part of my promise, I did my husband's responsibility, but time was dragged too long.!' \\nHowever, at that time, Song Xiaoxian cried very sad and cried for her own life. Although she did not understand exactly what the right-wing elements were going on, her husband was so difficult to enlighten his teeth. It was always not a good guy! The cave spent candlestick night, spent in the sad sip, until crying red eyes, weary body before the hazy sleep. The simple, thick girl is still a girl...\\nThe next day, Song Xiaoxian returned to school, with sad tears and melancholy. Qian mingqiang sent a trip after another, until the wife's figure disappeared in sight. He blessed silently in his heart: My good girl, good wife, accept me! I will always be hello, I'd rather eat porridge myself, and let you eat a full meal...\\nAfter his wife left, he did not dare to go to visit, looking forward to each other's echo every day. A month later, the green messenger finally brought him a good tone: the wife came to a letter, the letter said, she figured out, appointed; also said, she understands, knows that he is a good man, sport is a moment, life is a lifetime, she is willing to work with him...\\nLike a stone hanging in the heart of the ground, he felt relaxed, and immediately, touched the tears also took the track, the heart remembered: 'Know me, the wife!' He immediately took a leave and rushed to Ryan, and on Song Xiaoxian's rest day, began their honeymoon that was more bitter than sweet. \\n14, the head added a clamp spell\\nIn winter 1958, the Great Leap Forward movement began throughout the country. All the right-wing elements in Pingyang County were concentrated in Lingxi Township for winter breeding and steelmaking. He had only one thought at that time: again tired of hard work, to try to pick up the hat early, good to tell his wife. Therefore, whether it is field labor, "

				"memoirContent": "small plants, put high-density satellites or steel on a small blast furnace, are not dry overnight, often do not sleep for dozens of hours in a row, the longest time is 72 hours without a bed, labor performance is extremely outstanding. \\nIn early 1959, six opinions on the treatment of right-wing elements were given, and he expected a better result. Do you know that this disposition is not based on how much sweat you lost in labor as the standard. Qian mingqiang was expelled from public office and sent to her home to supervise labor. \\nCry without tears. After a bump in the journey of life, then returned to the 'white body', and more than then a spell-'supervision of labor', only a little freedom was lost. \\nThe problem is that his 'old house' is in Jinxiang, and Jinxiang has no relatives anymore. His biological mother lives in the big brother of Ryan; of course, the home of the Chin family is OK. However, he had reported back in the town of Tanghe and his adoptive father, Qian Wenji, disconnected from his father-son relationship. What is really a 'house leak in the night rain', he actually did not even have a place to accept 'supervision'! \\n'I can't go to my two homes, please organically agree me to go to Ryan to work, where my birth mother and big brother are there.' He asked the organizations concerned. \\n'Yes. Ryan and Binh Duong are not a county, you can find the specific place of work. About the leadership said. Don't underestimate the decision, which was very difficult in the circumstances at the time, which was actually the freedom to allow him to arrange his own work. \\nAfter reaching Ryan. Brother Peng Zhaolong contacted him with a place of work: the backward vegetable team on the outskirts of the city. Here is close to big brother's house, and growing vegetables is not hard. The brigade leader was reasonable and immediately arranged for him to live in the office of the production team, where a right-wing was already living there. He is a Waixian, polite and courteous to people. Who is willing to do nothing to this little intellectuals without reason? The team only treated him as a free half-labor, so the 'supervision' glyphs were fictitious. This was the best treatment for the right-wing elements who were assigned to work in rural areas at that time. \\nRural cadres are simple, not only do not 'supervise', the relationship between the brigade cadres and him is quite harmonious, often come to his place to chat, when they don't understand, and ask him for advice on things they don't understand. One or two, they will eat and drink together with each other. During the busiest spring season in the countryside, the brigade cadre also only assigned the easy things he sent to send seedlings behind the women. In the evening they helped the team site write slogans and publicize the great leap forward. \\nDue to his praise from the brigade cadres, not only can he receive $3.5 per month pocket money, but also lent him a separate room to let him pick up his wife to live together. At that time, Song Xiaoxian no longer read books and worked as a cashier in the nearby Red Flag Brigade. \\nThe arrival of his wife adds infinite warmth to his lonely life. In addition to the lack of money, he felt very satisfied, and increasingly felt that the proverb saying 'hard and bitter and sweet' is not unreasonable. \\nHe has actually become a 'free man.' So, he took the time to visit the father Qian Wenji. They are those who fall in the world, they understand each other very well. No one speaks of the past, but only the affection of the father and son. Qian Wenji worked at a health hospital and had some income every month. He also had a friend at the Chinese University of Hong Kong as head of the Chinese language department. He often sent money to support him, so he had a good life. \\nOn this trip, he also learned that Yan's mother's older daughter, that is, his sister, had gone as a soldier; the second daughter was given to the family as a child bridge-in-law; the third was left at home for agriculture, and later married to a converted soldier. The little son in exchange was only planted at home, and later married a landlord's daughter, so any 'movement' would have to fight. \\nHe also wanted to see Pang Mingzhang. But at that time, his father was also in labor reform, mainly because he smoked smoke when he was young. Shortly liberated, he was sentenced to ten years in prison and sent to labor reform until 1960 to return to Jinxiang in order to sweep the ugly phenomenon of 'yellow gambling' in old society. And two years before this, Qian mingqiang had wore a 'right' hat, and of course it was inconvenient to visit. His father did not work throughout his life, and would not do business, just in his home by planting a field, collecting rent for the day, release home after the old age, play chess with some old men all day and chat. His drug addiction has long been quitted, but still likes to hold a leftover of tin hookah, purr and purr over the smoke addiction. As a large number of cigarettes flock into the countryside, there were few people who smoked hookah at that time, and the smoke was hard to buy. Often when the smoke is broken, Qian mingqiang will take the initiative to send some from Ryan to do the piety. Well, at this time, the mother also returned from Ryan Jinxiang, the old two mouths together, finally not lonely in old age. \\n15, fight to live up a home\\nOne day, a friend visited. His arrival has made Qian mingqiang's life a little more color and a little more thrilling. This friend is named Bai Hung Lai. It turned out to be his colleague when teaching at Caobu Elementary School. This Mr. Bai was a cynical person in that year, he was a cynical person, unused things to say, did not make a few words of blame. As a result, in the late period of the anti-right movement, he was pulled out as a 'white flag', and therefore lost the rice bowl, and had to return to his home to work on a working day. This meager income, of course, is difficult to sustain a livelihood, and he is secretly doing a small business of long-distance trafficking. \\nwith misery. When he learned that Qian mingqiang's encounter is more miserable than him, hidden in the heart of chivalrous gas oil was born, on a special visit, and told Qian mingqiang: a pound of tea brought to Lanzhou, can be replaced with 4 packs of hookah, he has a friend called Yang Guizhu in Lanzhou, if interested, may have a try. \\nQian mingqiang refers to the calculation, this is a lucrative trading, rather than starving, it is better to go and touch luck. He was moved. So Baihong came and asked him to go with his nephew. \\nHe bite his teeth and bought more than 10 pounds of tea, each kilogram of 0.9 yuan. But how can these tea be brought to Lanzhou? It is important to know that buying and selling privately at that time was tied to capitalism; long distance trafficking was more illegal. Besides, he himself has a 'hat' in the body, and if found, the consequences are unimaginable! But tea has been bought, it's too late to play the drum, he can only 'fight to die eating puffer'. It was good that he was flexible in mind, the text works were much read, and the episode of 'work underground' depicted in the book quickly came into play. They brought a large bundle of old books and magazines, tied them tightly, and then dug a hole in the middle and put the tea in; they couldn't look down, and they brought an old hand gramophone with tea in the middle. The insurance factor for these disguised items is very high and does not attract the attention of the persons concerned. \\nThey take care of the road, as if they were to complete a sacred mission. Ruian to Lanzhou, the road is far away, both by boat and by car, often encounter checks and so on. Whenever this, he always shakes the handle of the shabby gramophone thousand times. But anyone with experience knows that not to open the lid, put a record, empty shaking handle is meaningless. 'Ha, this is really a thief's mind, the more you want to pretend nothing, the more it is flawed!' Afterwards, he remembered this low-level manoeuvre, even laughed himself. However, at the time, this kind of non-silver 3,200 in this place did not cause doubt. Perhaps those checking checks in the face of such a large bundle of books, newspapers, magazines and survival opportunities, also treated them as 'cadres who send culture to the countryside' of the relevant departments! They successfully passed a level, to Lanzhou, the tea quickly took off their hands, go one back. Deducting travel expenses, actually earned more than a dozen dollars. This is a modest income, and his wife boast of him! \\nHe knows the truth of 'greedy will lose'. The success of the first adventure, the kind of unstoppable temptation when struck to him, but he restrained, must temporarily stop hands, take a greater positive attitude to participate in the vegetable team labor, so as not to show that the dew does not cause others's heart. \\nDue to his active labor, good human affiliation, cadres of the brigade have treated him as a full member of the team, and assigned him a little bit of his own land according to the rules, allowing him to eat himself and change a little rice oil money. \\nQian mingqiang was very happy. With his hard work and cultural knowledge, he quickly mastered the skills of growing vegetables. He divided the land into three strips of cabbage, and the middle of the leek and onions. When fertilizing is a great deal of attention, how to match the proportion of manure and water, how to pour evenly, he first learned basic skills from the old farmer, and then in improving it, actually done very well. This place, he is as careful as a child, the result is the production of vegetables of high quality and good, in addition to the self-contained part, mostly picked to the market to sell a good price. He also specializes in selling dishes on holidays, and the couple sometimes pick and sometimes lift them, and when they go home, the money in the bag is much higher than his weekday income. \\nSong Xiaoxian is a good man of household chores and financial management. She will be very careful on weekdays, relying on this point of sale of vegetables, in not too long, actually accumulated a hundred yuan; she used these savings, and did not hesitate to make a building in Ruian Copper Bridge, above the bedroom, the kitchen underneath. A new home was held up like that. Life is bitter, but very warm, very satisfied. During this day, Qian Ming Qiang has made a lot of poems to recite their poor and beautiful pastoral life. Unfortunately, after decades of wind and rain, these destitute and rustic works have ceased to exist. \\nThe motivation that motivates them to support the family is due to his only daughter. In 1960 New Year's Day, early in the morning, Mr. Qian mingqiang went to work in his own land, to the sun rose to the top of the hill, about 8 o'clock went to the brigade to work. In general, the farmer brother always needs to get down to the ground until 9 hours, he always consciously volunteered earlier than others. At that time, someone sent a letter saying that his wife had gone to the hospital to have children. Until Qian mingqiang arrived, her daughter had been crumbling. For the first time, the joy of fatherhood and motherhood enveloped the troubled couple, and feared that the house borrowed to them in the brigade would cause inconvenience to mothers and babies, resulting in the idea of holding another home. They gave her daughter a nice name, Ruijuan, because she was born in Ryan. \\n16, meet the 'big right' Huang Yuan\\nIn the year of the great leap forward, every winter, rural areas have to invest in water conservancy. Almost invariably, the right who devolves 'supervision of labor' in rural areas has to participate. In winter 1996, more than 100 right-wing people in rural Ruian were concentrated in Dongshan Haitang. Cold winds, waves whistling, red flags, trumpet sound, big embankment up and down, a hot scene. \\nQian mingqiang is the team leader of the Tangxi District. This group has the right, big and small, sent from all over, and no one knows anyone. But he is a group of long, always have to map the bottom, send a job to call a name. Do not want, a touch of a big jump. Originally in this group there is a great right in the province and nationwide, named Huang Yuan. He was heard that he was an old revolution, big leader, and a student and comrades of Mr. Dawen Hao Lu Xun. In 1957, somehow it would be beaten as the right, and became one of the four major right in Zhejiang Province (the other three are Shawenhan and Song), Yun Bin, Peng Ruilin). In the case of these big cadres, Bibi, he suddenly felt that his 'small right' was really not a big disaster. He would love to know the great right, but he has not had a chance to come. \\nThe opportunity has finally come. This day is moving stone, building embankment. In addition to taking the lead in moving stones, he also has to direct others how to move. In order to speed up, he ordered to change to 'drumming flower' type of transmission method: people standing into a long serpentine, the people behind the stone passed to the people in front, in turn to the embankment. This requires everyone to cooperate with tacit understanding, master the rhythm, will not middle 'card shell', delay time. However, he always felt that whenever the stones passed in the middle, the speed would slow down. He did not stop his eyes, but saw a skinny old man of nearly 60 years old, holding hold in the transfer of the stone sent over, others were moved with his hands, and he could only hold the stone in his chest slowly moving forward. It is clear that he is overwhelmed in old age and can only be so transported. Plus the old man was wearing a dark blue, woven cotton jacket with flowers, not wearing shoes on his feet but wearing socks, all over and under the body covered with slime, which is more noticeable. So he walked over and said with concern, 'You are so old, if you can't eat, take a break!' \\n'No, because it used to touch mud too little, so become the right, now should contact mud more...' said the elderly. \\nWhen he listened very impressed, he asked, 'Your last name? Where did you come from?' \\n'I was devolved from the province to work here, my name is Huang Yuan.' \\n'Oh, you are Huang Yuan!' He did not ask again. At that time, the oil in his heart was born a taste that was unclear. How would cadres of such age and infirm, so big cadres should also participate in such heavy labor? But he did not say, nor dare to say, that he can only send jobs or give some care, either explicitly or secretly. \\nOf course, compared to the old cadres who were hit in the Cultural Revolution several years later, this intensity of labor is not enough. But it was not possible to anticipate this 'sharp warming' mode of movement...\\nOn February 9, 1997, the third day of the Lunar New Year, this is the Chinese traditional grand festival-the Spring Festival. After years of vicissitudes, Qian mingqiang came to a villa in Gesen, Hangzhou West Lake, to the owner of Comrade Huang Yuan for a new year. This year Huang Yuan has been 93 years old, still healthy, clear ideas, reading newspapers do not wear glasses. In the talk, each other can't help to praise the new life that the Party's new policy has brought to them. When he asked the elderly about the situation when he was working in Ruian Dongshan Haitang that year, Huang Yuan recollected slightly, and said, 'Remember, remember, how can I not remember it? Then you could be young!' Qian mingqiang said: 'I was just in the early twenties, and now I can become an old man.' Huang Yuan said: 'Not old, I'm 30 years older than you, don't you live well? I have a lot to do!' The old man's spirit of living to old, dry to old, optimistic and upward moved Qian mingqiang deeply. He thought: this is the true nature of an old revolution, suffering from great suffering, no regrets, and dedicated to the Party for the people, and has died. This visit once again inspires the sail of the chairman of Qian's Group, who is already 63 years old and has many industries, he is determined to continue to develop and make greater contributions to the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. \\n17. Survival in the seam\\nIn 1963, Wenzhou rural 'three from one package' got hot. Qian mingqiang is not a local rural household. Naturally, Qian mingqiang cannot be allocated to his own land, and after his vegetable team is distributed according to half labor, only six points a day, and this income is difficult even for him alone. The wife used to make a cashier in the Red Flag Brigade, and had an income, but his 'hat' on his head caused her to lose the rice bowl, and at that time, they already had two children, which seemed to be aggravated by the snow, it was difficult to see. \\nIn order to survive, the couple thought of having gone to Lanzhou to sell tea to make money, decided to come to a seam to survive, go out to do business again. \\nThe goods sold are not limited to tea, as long as they are slightly profitable, they do anything. The couple entrusted her eldest daughter Ruijuan to his mother-in-law and a little aunt; then with her swaddling older son Ruinan (now renamed Anan), began to embark on a trip to Lanzhou thousands of miles. How many years later, when Qian mingqiang recalled this experience, he lamented, saying, 'What is the life of a man? All day care, dodge, like fleeing, what bitter has not eaten! And Song Xiaoxian remembers this hard time, he can't help but cry. \\nThat is indeed the case. They just do tea business. Along the way, Song Xiaoxian holds the child, and has to carry two big burdens, diapers in the bundle and tea. Qian mingqiang was empty with his hands behind. This is not that he is unthoughtful of his wife and is reluctant to take care of him, but because Song Xiaoxian's family component is the urban poor-equivalent to poor farmers in rural areas. This is the object of the Party and the government's dependence, and if caught, there will be no big problems. However, he belongs to the 'five categories of molecules'. In case the tea of long-distance traffickers is found from him, the consequences are unimaginable. He can only be hard, empty hands behind, and only when she holds her child on and off the car, the burden is difficult to help her. The wife is meritful and well understood, she never resented her husband, and in the eyes of people, in order to avoid things, she always clenched her teeth alone. Despite the hardship, but eventually still made a little money, it was not worth the trip. \\nWith the spread of 'three to one package', more things on the market have become more, and the people who do business have started to become active, but at that time there was no clear provision that this practice was legal, especially with regard to 'long-distance trafficking' and 'abandonment of agricultural business' and so on. The Chin and couple did not know the inside, seeing many people doing business, and the tight string in the head slowly loosened down. \\nOne day, they saw a Daogu on the way to sell Yuanhu (famous Chinese herbal medicine), and the business was very earning. An inquiry, the knowledge is from Dongyang vendors in Zhejiang. They rushed to Dongyang day and night, and soon found a partner. The partner invited them to eat a meal on the night when they poured all their herbs. Side dish is ham burning taro. A long time did not see fishy money Mingqiang, often appetite increased, and wanted to drink alcohol. Don't want to be bustling, causing the woes, the local commune government news sent people to catch them. As a result, all the medicinal herbs purchased were confiscated, returned to Wenzhou and spent months of hard brewing soup. \\nWenzhou, whether it is in the 'three to one package' years or in the era of reform and opening up, the people have always had a particularly strong sense of goods, so the free market is particularly flourishing. Qian mingqiang also resides in Wenzhou, as a base to facilitate the distribution of goods. His father had a friend's son who specifically found him and wanted to work with him to do business. Conditions are quite favorable: by the other side out of the funds, he is responsible for selling, if you can earn money, one half. However, the risk must be borne by him. Qian mingqiang was neither an account nor food tickets, food tickets, household goods tickets. And these tickets were the most essential necessities of life at that time. The only way to survive can only be to earn a little more money and buy a variety of tickets at high prices to sustain life. But he has no means, how does a family of four live? Now some people are willing to make money with him, this is a unique opportunity for a lifetime. Even if the risk is greater, it can only be 'knowing that there are tigers, biased toward Tiger Mountain.' \\nHe was blessed. Continue to do the herb business. In order to escape inspections, they do not dare to stay in a hotel and often spend the night at the train station. Winter night, the cold hit people, a family of three covered only a dilapidated coat, holding waiting for tomorrow; in order to escape. They never dare to get up and off at the station, and instead prefer to take more than ten more miles to wait for a remote station. Often full of deserted grass, as sharp as a knife in the winter cold wind on the face, even hum dare not hum. But despite being so careful, they are often caught, twice and three times, scared their souls. \\nIt was on their journey from north to south, train to Pukou Station. There was no Yangtze River Bridge at that time. Trains to and from the Yangtze River needed to cross the Yangtze River. They didn't know that there were checkpoints at the ferry. Once near, they were not too late to run, and the wife's big burden was quickly found out of the party participants bought from the northwest, which cost more than 200 yuan in total. Qian mingqiang scared white, heart beating violently, thought, this time it was a heavy loss, and escaped in the disaster! \\n'What are you doing?' The inspectors looked into their faces. \\n'Comrade, this is called Party Ginger. We have to eat when we have children there.' Song Xiaoxian did not panic and used my fingers to his big belly, 'I'm going to produce it right away, I bought it from home!' \\nThe inspector looked at her big belly and waved his hand, 'Go!' \\nQian mingqiang at that time, if not under the eyes of the public, he really wanted to shout around his wife: 'You are really brave!' \\nOnce again, they bought a batch of Chuanxiong from Chengdu, Sichuan. Once the goods were bought, they were hiding under the bed of a friend's house, ready to buy tickets south. The local resident cadres came to their friend's house to check the rat cave. The hole was not found, but many Chuanxiong were detected. Friends can't even say anything, and Song Xiaoxian automatically assumes that these herbs are her. As a result, she was taken to the police station by resident cadres. Song Xiaoxian has a head back experience, boldness is bigger, he has a big belly, also pulled a child around, unhurried to come to a self-reported home, saying that his family composition is the urban poor. He needs to eat Chuangxiong. I heard that this side is cheap, we came to buy some personal use. \\n'Difficult to eat so much? Explicitly take it to engage in trafficking!' This time the police station was not easy to believe. \\n'Comrade, do own household.' Song Xiaoxian said: 'There are many things going to sell to other mother-in-law, subsidizing a little car and boat costs.' \\nEven if you're telling the truth! Chuanxiong is a Chinese medicine acquired by the State and can not be sold privately. 'The police station is not moved,' you can go back, these herbs are purchased at the national price, and the money will be taken in a few days! \\nSong Xiaoxian had to return to his friend's home and wanted to find someone to talk about it. He knew that this friend fell down the stone, saying that several cigarettes that he bought had also been confiscated by the resident cadres, and she should compensate for the loss. Song Xiaoxian rushed to the neighborhood committee and asked, there was no such thing at all. The knowledge was that friends had a black heart and wanted to take a chance to knock the bamboo. The result is: Qian mingqiang was helplessly taken off the sweater he wore on his body, put 20 yuan of money, and then let his wife go to Xi'an first, waiting for himself to wait in Chengdu, until he gets the money to acquire Chuanxiong and then go to Xi'an to meet. Well, I waited for two days, not only did not get a penny, the police came to catch people again. Fortunately met a hometown in Wenzhou, borrowed more than 10 yuan, and the escape generally came to Xi'an. \\nOn the West Street of Xi'an, there is a 'Juan Hotel', where they travel to and from. The hotel attendants are familiar. There are often public security personnel here to check the house, and the waiters see his family three very poor, often help to say some good words, and it is over. They finally did some business and made some money. \\nHowever, Xi'an is not Wenzhou, and it is very difficult to do business. If you don't get it, you will be left out of money. If they want to sell herbs, they still have to go through 'scalpers' (brokers). This is an illegal 'channel of circulation', of course, there are risks, but there are fish roads, shrimp and shrimp roads, and nothing has happened. There was knowledge there, once, the 'scalper' and 'scalper' due to the unequal distribution between the two sides, the two sides were noisy, alarmed the industrial and commercial administration departments, and the 'scalper' fell into the net. They quickly confessed that people were engaged in 'capitalism' through this channel, with the name of Qian mingqiang. Well, he quickly got the wind sound and immediately ran away with his wife. They simply did not dare to get on the bus at Xi'an Railway Station. They had to carry a burden, carrying their son, moving one by step to the small station Baqiao in the suburbs. But they did not dare to wait in the station, but have to wait outside. Sharp northwest wind drilled directly to the body, people frozen, had to step in place, to increase a little warmth, so stay until the station began wicket, just like 'stowaways' in general mixed into the station. The result of this trip to Xi'an is 'stealing chicken does not erode rice', empty hands, no money. \\nSo far, the great world has no place for them, and a family of three has to return to Ryan. \\nHave a family return, desperate. \\nRuian Copper Bridge, an ordinary building, cross seals on the gate, on which the relevant departments of the local government are stamped. When the Qian mingqiang family has suffered from three to their own home, it became a blind flow of homelessness. It was also a product of the 'catching class struggle' and 'cutting the tail of capitalism.' Without the consent of the homeowner at all, the house was sealed off. No one dared to speak out and could not complain according to the normal legal channels. Qian mingqiang has a 'hat' on his head, after the butt has a 'tail', it is not dare to squeak, but had to tear to live, go back to Jinxiang. \\nAll said, The native land is difficult. But he wanted to do nothing, he had a big circle outside, and after having been displaced for several years, he returned to the starting point. And this 'starting point' is no longer the same. He is no longer the grandfather of the Chian family, and since he left his parent-child relationship, there is certainly no place for him here. He was only able to return to Peng's family, who left at the age of 3. But then there was another rule in the countryside: you have passed to the village family as a son, there will be no place for you here, and the production team's roster cannot have your name, because everything is based on the existence of an account or not. In this way, neither work nor land, how to live a family of four? \\nPengjia's folks are thoughtful and simple. Adults manage adults, and can't always see a few children starving to death? The production team unanimously recognized that the children were restored to Peng and moved to Jinxiang resident's accounts. Qian mingqiang and couple were touched by tears at the time. Although the two adults still had no account, as long as the children had an account, they had a lot less 'worries'. 'I will always remember the mercy of my hometown folks.' Qian mingqiang said so many times during our interview. \\nThey had a place to rest and relieved their hearts, but the difficulties of housing ensued. Pengjia's old residence simply cannot accommodate their family. There are brothers and siblings above, and Song Xiaoxian is about to give birth to a third child, that is, squeeeze into 5 people, is tantamount to 'doing dojo in a screw shell', there is no possibility. \\nThere is always no open air accommodation! The whole family negotiated to negotiate, had to free up a 'house room' behind the old house. The so-called 'house room' is the place where the coffin is parked for burial in the countryside. This place was originally an aisle, from the front street to the back street, people from here, and the wind blows from all sides, both cold and unsafe. But anyway, there's always a place to get off, and Shah's mother is together, how many have a care. They cleaned up a bit rough. Just set it down. \\nOn January 18, 1964, Song Xiaoxian gave birth to his third child in this room, their younger son, Switzerland (now renamed the leader). At that time, the older daughter in foster care at Grandma's house also returned. The family of five is pressed like five mountains on the head of Qian mingqiang. One may wish to imagine: since 1958 Qian mingqiang put on the 'right-wing' hat, life has been displaced, lack of food and wear, all day still have to be attentive to spend the day, if he does not have his pain and the common boat to help, for him to share child-rearing, struggling to support this troubled poverty The pressure of home, can he become a man of reform today? 'Absolutely impossible!' Qian mingqiang said from heart: 'If I had not had the privilege of marrying a good wife of Daxian Dade, sharing the pressure for me and gave me the courage and strength to survive, I would have been away from the world.' \\nIt was with his wife to raise the burden of raising three children, and as a man, he had to take the risk again. \\nHe bought a pair of goods Lang Tan, early in the morning out of the East Gate, along the beach, along the sea wind burst,"

				"memoirContent": " all the way shaking the leather drum 'small department store!' It was not until sunset west mountain, from the South Gate to return home. In fact, he sells everything except daily necessities: oil eggs, herbs, sweets, old clothes. Dragon Boat Festival is about to sell Cang, wormwood, male yellow; Nearly New Year, sell red dates, persimmon cake red gift bag. \\n18, he even sold feces\\nBut this small sale of village string, with the needs of the family of five, is really 'five bottles and two caps', the lid to cover can not cover. Sometimes it is bad, even money can't earn money back, breadwinners can only be self-deceiving empty words. And for the three children who boil to feed, he dreamed of making more money. He thought: since the goods lang can not pay out, go to be hard force! At that time, Fujian Province, which was close to Zhejiang, needed a large number of migrant workers to go to open mountains and repair roads, and heard that the pay was good, just living a bit bitter. 'Not afraid of suffering, as long as you can make some money home!' Qian mingqiang did not hesitate to leave the goods, bid farewell to his wife and children, trek to Fujian, and then rolled over to Fuzhou. He was introduced to the mountain site. He was assigned the task of moving steel brazing and transporting stones. In the meantime, the knowledge of the original so-called good pay is a false propagation, where the standard of living is much lower than Wenzhou, and the hardship of work is not what ordinary people can afford. In order to save that little wage, he dare not enough to eat, often hungry. On one occasion, a rat was drilled from the cave, caught by him, wrapped up with bamboo leaves to simmer the mouse meat, greatly improved his life. \\nHe often catches mice. But there are too few opportunities, plus that little wage, even the necessary daily expenses are difficult to maintain. Some friends advised him to keep beekeeping, saying that he can sell a good price, so he wanted to keep beekeeping. What about the cost? At that time, each box of bees was 60 yuan, if there were more than a thousand yuan in the pocket, you can go. But he did not, had to 'prosper sighs'. A friend from Wenzhou borrowed him some money and let him do a small business that he can. So he cooperated with several fellow countrymen to engage in the sale of herbs again. \\nThey bought the Party Ginseng and wanted to bring back to Wenzhou to turn their hands. Companion first he walked a few days, he again, with hope of 20 pounds of Party Ginseng, and the acquisition of 2.64 gold nibs, from the station to get off, and then discard the train, take a car, all the way to Yongkang, and then take a coach from Yongkang to Wenzhou. That's when one news came: his business partners, Lao Pan, Lao Li and others, were arrested. Like a blue bolt, shocked his eyes with golden flowers, chills all over the body. He hasn't waited for his frightening to stop, he has been caught into the Wenzhou Municipal Council. \\n20 kilograms of party participants confiscated, 2.64 two gold nibs confiscated, and was ordered to 'speculate the gangs' to expose each other. From an early age by Liangshan good man chivalrous wind, thought 'everyone suffers, not as a person to bear', the other partners have all come to their own, where to know, partners in order to 'strive for leniency', have long confessed, with him all sorry. He was painful and sentimental, and he could only be detained alone in isolation at the municipal council. \\nThat's it, one level is 7 days. Later, the responsible comrade of the Institute of Industry and Commerce looked at his communication materials, and then generated compassion, and came to a 'net open side': first, party staff members and gold nibs were bought by the government and returned part of the money; second, sent people back home and suggested that the local government give a way out of living. \\nThe Golden Township was not the town of gold, but the poor. Although it was in the spring of 1965, agricultural production had recovered more than before, many people left their agriculture out of their way of livelihood. When the deportees of the municipal council made proposals to the town government, they were not only unable to do so, but also asked him to continue to confess: how much money has actually been made through 'speculation' these years? And capturing the wind said he earned more than 3,000 yuan. He simply frightened the door. Because according to the land reform policy at that time: all expenses are not counted, three years earning 3000 yuan can be sentenced. \\nOf course, he wouldn't be stupid. After several interrogations, some subjective speculation could not be achieved. Although people have returned home, they followed a hard coercive measure: never go out to engage in 'speculation'. That is, not allowed to go out to do business, be honest in his hometown under supervision. \\nLike a hunted bison, he was eventually tied to Jinxiang and could not move freely. A family of 5 people, eat and drink every day. Where can borrow, can still owe the place to be owed, and the broken house, can sell things that can be sold, I really don't know how the future days will pass? Speaking of it, people may not believe that the sea shrimp is the cheapest side dish, but their 3 children can eat only one shrimp or one oil tofu per day, adding a bowl of salt soup to increase their physical fitness. This is no different than the three-year difficult period. The only thing that deserves his masturbation is that his wife has no complaints, and the children are good, never quarrel about eating. The more it is, the more painful his heart is, if he didn't say something that shouldn't be said, not being beaten as 'right-wing', all of this may be another look, how much he regrets! This 'hat' made him miserable enough, not only did his own suffering, but also tired of the whole family. \\n19, by chaos escape\\nRed flag show, slogan, big print newspaper overflowing. In 1966, the unprecedented Cultural Revolution began. When ordinary people still did not understand exactly what it was, at that time, schools and institutions had become a pot of porridge. At that time, Song Xiaoxian had given birth to his fourth child and was also a boy. He was very beautiful and pampered by his parents. However, with Qian mingqiang's sensitivity to many years of political movement, he felt that a great difficulty was coming soon. As the saying goes, 'The good man does not eat his immediate loss', he took the opportunity of the administration at that time to take care of him, leaving his wife who was still in the midst of childbirth, and came to a mess escape. On the one hand, avoid the head, on the one hand to break through the living road. At that time, a good friend borrowed some money to him and bought some tea straight to Xi'an. \\nLater, it turned out that his escape was a great choice; otherwise, there was a hardship to eat. Shortly after his flight, the father and mother of his peng family were fought because they were part of the 'landlord'. It is only because they are good in their hearts and for men on weekdays, there is not much trouble for the people. \\nThe family's adoptive father of course became the target of batter. Because the mother of the Yan was thin, and the wrath of the folks broke out on weekdays, and indeed they were suffering. Although Qian Wenji did not suffer more hardship, he had to fight at every round of fighting, because of old age and weak, he died after a rudge home on January 30, 1967. \\nDuring this period, there were also some mass organizations to ask about the whereabouts of Qian mingqiang. However, Song Xiaoxin did not know, while the villain faced with this 'urban poor' woman who was born was unable to act lightly, it would be impossible. If Qian mingqiang is in the local area, it will be used as a key object of 'sweep all the cattle gods' into the cattle shed. \\nBut temporarily can not sweep, not equal to not sweep. It was just the privilege of picking him up a respite. \\nThis respite is not long, but things are quite a few. \\nAfter he fled to Xi'an, he went to the home of a production team leader in the suburbs through his acquaintance. The other side offered to eat, live, take 0.5 yuan a day's salary. At that time he had such conditions he was satisfied with his heart, and the landlord was the leader of a team, objectively had a protective umbrella, and the days were too peaceful. \\nThe rural suburbs of Xi'an, unlike the rural areas of Jiangnan, farmers eat only two meals a day. Get up in the morning first to work, at 8, 9 o'clock home to eat Wo head, and then go to work until 3, 4 o'clock in the afternoon, after finishing work and eating a morning and dinner. \\nBecause Xian went many times, stayed long days, with Xi'an's Wenzhou people were quickly familiar with, at that time some Wenzhou people specialize in raw paint business: buy raw paint on the market in Xi'an, and then bring back to Wenzhou to sell, earn a good job. As a result, Qian mingqiang took advantage of his work, take a bus to line up to buy raw paint in the city, and he could run three or four stores each time, and then put the paint together and give it to the raw paint dealers from Wenzhou. In this way, deducting the round-trip fare, you can also earn some money, however. After all, these foot power money is limited. So, he again put the accumulated labor money and foot money together, and also bought more than 10 pounds of raw paint, packed in nylon bags, ready to take it to Wenzhou for sale once there is a chance. He has repeatedly counted that this batch of raw paint off hands, can earn dozens of yuan, and can temporarily maintain life at home. \\nAccording to the political developments at the time. The chance to go home is not yet ripe. In order to avoid a long delay in a place, will bring unnecessary trouble, he is like sporty soldiers in general, and finally go down to the south mountain to do small work. This is an exceptionally remote and hard-cold area where salt is not available and iodine deficiency is widespread. It is said that Han Dynasty marshal Han Xin trained soldiers here that year. But there is plenty of persimmon, almost household households eat persimmon, wine is also made with persimmon. For guests, guests are asked to wash their mouth with persimmon water. Is the lack of vegetables. The active labor there can only take 800 labor points a year, and each division is 8 cents, that is, the annual income is 64 yuan, life is hard enough. Because of the hardship, souvenirs are especially cheap, big live chicken as long as 2 cents a pound, tea, raw paint is also cheaper than the mountain. So, he also painted gourd according to the same pattern, using the work, to buy tea, raw paint, live chicken to Xi'an, sold to fellow people from Wenzhou, so it also made a little money. \\nAt the end of 1966, he received a letter from his wife's Toephan, stating that war was being waged within the insurgency, and that he had no chance to take care of other things and asked him to return home for the New Year. He did miss his wife and children and immediately bought some years' goods south. But the traffic was overcrowded, full of large numbers of red guards and revolutionary masses. He hastily rushed to reach Jinxiang until the first 30 years, knocking down the door was midnight, in addition to the wife still waiting, the sons and daughters entered the dream. Song Xiaoxanji's husband came back, and the heart was put down. She woke up the children one by one, and then sat down, and she had a reunion meal with Meidi. \\nCertainly peace is nothing. He spent the Spring Festival at home, although poor but very warm, and went to Xi'an at the beginning of the seventh month to do business. He was not as careful as the last flight, but was familiar with buying 80 pounds of raw paint, and boldly took two Xian partners, and then returned to Wenzhou again, ready to earn a vote. \\nThis time, however, he misassessed the situation and the hearts of the people. When three of them arrived in Wenzhou, ready to disperse the paint into their cousins and siblings home, I don't know who played a small report. People in the municipal council have come to cousins and are patiently waiting for the self-throwing of prey. \\nCousin learned that the cousin was coming, hurried, had to make a round of tea water and municipal council people, the elusive cousin turned out of the door, a pulled up to his home money Mingqiang, rushed down a sentence: 'Escape, people in the municipal council are waiting to catch you at home!' \\nHe scared the soul out of the tricks He also had no time to think about why the municipal council smell was so sensitive, how did he know he was coming this day? He thanked the cousin. Don't turn around and fled to the house of the cousin in the countryside in Tangxi. He secretly rejoiced, finally escaped a robbery. \\nHowever, once the municipal council has looked at you, the open net is never easily collapsed, set a saying then, called 'With your three and six arms, you cannot escape from the palm of the Buddha's hand. \\nUnwanted charges descended from the sky again\\nAfter hiding for three days in Tangxi Township, I really can't rest assured, want to slip back to Wenzhou to see the situation. He returned to Wenzhou this time with another intention: to wait until he got out of the paint, and with the money, he went to beekeeping. Because beekeeping has a good head, and the wide range of activities in the north of the South China Sea, political movements have become more powerful, and it is difficult to find him. \\nDuring the day, he waited patiently until the day slowly dimmed down, and immediately departed to catch the last ship at 5:30, arriving in Wenzhou estimated at around 8 o'clock. \\nEverything goes well. There was no anomaly in his day and night. So he took advantage of the misty street lights, bustling crowds, and quickly came to the house of a friend named Bao. He wanted to explore the situation first, and then stay late in the night and then go to his cousin. \\nOf course, Bao's friend knew he was fine, and he received him with courage, sat down and said something for a while, and quickly sent him out. \\n'Stand! Qian mingqiang, you can't run!' A break drink, trembling him as a wood carved at the door. \\nBut there were two people standing up in the shop across from the store, quickly reached the front with a hundred meters sprint speed, 'chuck' and his hands were handcuffed. Originally, plainclothes from the municipal council were waiting for him. Here, we still need to add a few words: according to the reason, the arrest must be approved by the procuratorial organs and then carried out by the public security department. However, at that time, the political and legal organs were basically paralyzed, and no rule of law was at all. Organisations can catch people at will, not to mention still hung the signs of the market management board, representing the proletarian walk What about institutions that practice dictatorial power on the path of capitalism? No one will ask if it is legal and nobody dare to speak. Qian mingqiang can only be beforehand and conquered. \\nHe was escorted to the municipal office and then held in a shady hut. He was scared at that time, but much more was heartache money. 'This time, it seems to have to be severely punished a large sum of money, alas!' He was prepared for thought with sorrow. But how can a person who even has his own destiny in the hands of others see his end? \\nAfter a few days, he was taken into a car and travelled to his old home, Golden Township. It was not until then that he was accused of having to participate honestly in the fighting conference. He relieved his heart, oh, it turned out to be a reverse typical to accept the criticism of his hometown father and folks. In that kind of years, congresses, small meetings, every day, he saw much post office experienced a lot, as long as honestly not to top the mouth, confession problems infinite on the line, will not eat much hardship, not to mention in his hometown, will always open a side. \\nWhen he went to Jinxiang, he was detained in the district government. In view of the attitude of the authorities towards him, it is increasingly confirmed that his thoughts are right, and he is allowed to meet with relatives. Song Xiaoxian visited him four or five times in a row. Every time he came, he also brought brown sugar, lard and noodles to fill him up, and his wife always comforted him. There would be no big problems. Don't think of it, leave the mountain in, not afraid to burn firewood. When a person loses his freedom, it can't be better than the comfort and encouragement of his loved ones, and he really learns the true meaning of 'afflicted couple'. \\nWhen Song Xiaoxian came to visit him for the sixth time, he found that his wife was overshadowed. After he repeatedly asked his wife to bite his teeth, told him a few news: first thing, during his day of detention, his wife had travelled to Wenzhou to handle the goods he had stored there. It was not expected that someone had been robbed by fire, and most of the more than 1,000 yuan of the goods were removed, only a few of them left Points, the maximum value of one, two hundred yuan. The second thing is that the little son has lost his brain to death. He listened like five lightning hit top, heartache cracking, yelling: 'How can this be?' \\nEven blame the wife for why not timely delivery to the hospital for rescue. Until he calmed down, the wife told him in tears that it was for his things to be loosened, she walked around with her little son all day long before she infected the brain, and when she found out and rushed to the hospital, she could not be cured. After Qian mingqiang listened, even pulled his own hair knocking on their head, crying in abrupt pain: 'Children, all dad hurt you, Dad sorry you, I also do not have a way to live for a family!' \\n'Ming Qiang, you have to resist ah, I have something to tell you, let you have a thought ready, or not, you will not stand it!' Wife trembles pale and said. \\n'Say it! What more than a dead son can't stand?' \\nHowever, when the wife told him, he suddenly stayed as a wooden chicken, shaking his body until a good moment, only issued a burst of grief: 'God, how do I fall this way, I... I finished, completely and completely finished!' \\nThe sad news is that he has been sentenced to seven years in prison. \\nIt was 1967, he was 33 years old. Sentenced for seven years and 40 years after being released from prison. 'Treat me out is old, very old, how to live my family!' He called, did not eat or drink, just wash his face with tears...\\nHe could not understand that he was a client, but the relevant political and legal authorities had never brought him before him, neither investigated evidence nor heard his own complaints. How had he been convicted without his knowledge? Where is the basis? Where is the law? \\nIt does not matter at all, and the master has, of course, a legal basis that they believe to be good. The next day, in the square of Jinxiang, crowds surged, and various flags flying. In fact, 10,000 people were held. Prisoners a string of people, in the slogan of the sky, bow down to climb up on a temporary bench. There are so many people who were battered this time, even handcuffs were not enough. Most of the people who committed their hands were tied back with a coarse rope. \\nCriticize one by one, pronounce judgment one by one. Finally it was the turn of Qian mingqiang, he listened upright, like a pot of ice water, drained from head to toe. He turned out to be held on the big charge of 'speculating the bad elements'. The text of the judgment was as follows: 'The right-wing, Qian mingqiang, male, 33 years old, Jinxiang in Pingyang County, Zhejiang, is a filial son and grandson of the bureaucratic landlords. Since the struggle against the right, not honestly accept supervision and transformation, but engage in speculative activities for a long time. From X, 1958 to X, 1967, there were 13 times, making a total of more than $3400. In accordance with article X, paragraph X, of the Criminal Code, the special sentence is seven years' imprisonment. The sentence is from 31 March 1967 to 30 March 1974.' \\nHe listened to cry without tears, nor did he want to argue on the spot, because he knew that in such a situation of furious affection, he could only ask for hardship. What was pervasive in his broken heart at that time was a confused piece, he had no household, no food tickets, no living goods tickets, just for survival, breadwinding, doing a small business, eating a lot of hard work, and still have to be held in prison as bad guys. Fair? Is it reasonable to starve and freeze death alive? \\n20, the first suicide attempt\\nSpring cold material. A few armed men arrived early in the morning and he will be taken to the Pingyang County Detention Centre. In other words, he will leave his home town and it is not known where he will be sent to re-education. It is really 'cold, deserted and miserable, even cold and cold will be hard to rest', and the love of wives, children and loved ones is stronger than ever. Exactly: from now, after a few years of sadness? \\nAt that time, there was no road from Jinxiang to Binh Duong, but only waterways. Take a liner from Jinxiang to Fang Yan (now known as Longgang), to Aojiang. Then disembarked by Ao Jiang and then take a car to Binh Duong. He had a bowed head, his hands were tied tightly with a hemp rope, several prisoners were close to each other, and armed men were held at the end. On the way, there is an indifferent gaze, as well as a point of discussion. He knows that in such an atmosphere, relatives and friends are not daring to send away, and he is like a wounded lone geese, can only mourn unknowingly. He thought, so well, when the province got met more sad. \\nBut he was wrong. When they had not yet arrived at the Jinxiang pier, he saw his wife standing there in the cold wind of Suisse, beside the three children, all timidly holding his mother's cloths, with tears in his small eyes, but no one dare to shout. In addition, there were two neighbors who also came to the way, and they had boldly nodded at him. In adversity, a little bit will make life memorable, not to mention that he was a prisoner and an 'enemy of the people' widely recognized at the time. He was touched by tears, and in his heart was afraid of even tired of them, even if he dare to say hello, but looked at all those who sent off, he walked quickly and passed. He has a fresh memory of this scenario, and he said, 'I am grateful to these two neighbors for my whole life!' \\nOn March 30, 1997, that is, after 30 years, I wrote Qian mingqiang's biography, was accompanied by Song Xiaoxian to a small shop on the road side of the East Gate of Jinxiang. The housewife was her neighbor Ms. Huang Xiaochai. She is 64 years old this year, but her body is still tough, hands and feet. When asked how she dare to go to the pier to send money, she seemed very thoughtful... She said: 'I am a poor farmer, I rely on the object, and the unstable hat won't hold my head. In addition, Peng's family treats people with good grace. All Jinxiang people know. At that time, we were all poor, had no money, could not help, and could only give a little emotional support. When my sister and I heard that Qian mingqiang was going to go, I did not know where to allocate to labor, I rushed to the North Gate Wharf to send farewell. In fact, just look at him a few eyes, nodding, no need to hang on the heart.' I was very moved. Although it was a small matter, he fully showed the kind character of Chinese women, and proposed to take a photo to them in order to attach them to it at the time of writing. She promised it happily. His old companion seemed even more excited, and his face was naturally revealing pride for his wife. So, four of their grandchildren's group photo set in the camera, the background of two farmer entrepreneurs luxury homes, compared to the past and present, like a mythical castle. \\nAfter saying goodbye to Huang Xiaochai, we found her sister Huang again. She was 55 years old, and she had a fresh memory of her year. Ideas turned out to be so consistent with her sister, their composition is good, no worries, people in the countryside on weekdays, are very good to come, fall difficult, go send what can not? From this woman, we have once again seen the pacific wind of the heavy homeland and friendship of Chinese farmers. Compared with the kind of knowledge, culture, and education on the surface, once something happens, we will fall down or run away from fear, there is really a difference in the realm! \\nLater, the author went to the North Gate Pier and took pictures. There is a wide river, clear water, both sides of the willow, a boat berth, in the old old road side of the new building lined, people come to people, the river flow, but here is not a waterway pier. Nowadays to Longgang-that year called Fangyan has a car direct, to the boiljiang has long no ferry, there is a highway direct. Song Xiaoxian said: 'This flourishing scene is only after the reform and opening up.' Yes, the ideal of 'old appearance' can only become vibrant and refreshed only under the spring of reform and opening up. \\nHowever, Qian mingqiang in that year could only follow the desolate ancient trail, under the liberation of public security officers, walked with worries, as in ancient times, escort prisoners to distribution places. He had only one question in his mind: 'Sentenced seven years, 40 years old, then he was released from prison, what else can people do?' This problem wrenched him dizzy, like a drain into the tip of the horn, can no longer be relieved. It was not until the security officers pulled him on a ferry and ordered him to sit honestly aside, he found out that he had reached the pier under the rock. From here, you can take a car to the river, and then directly to Pingyang County City. That is, he will soon be put into jail, suffering in the iron window. \\n'Everybody sit down, start the boat!' The ferry started with a drink. The little ferries are crowded, and anyone has no choice to take care of. Qian mingqiang just came back to God's drink, suddenly stood up from the seat, flock to the river a jump, thought: but the remnant, a hundred, in order to achieve a real relief!-That's his first suicide. \\n'Someone throws water!' People yell and ferries began to shake up. \\n'Stay quiet!' Public security personnel drank with calm, 'He wants to die too!' \\nOriginally, Qian mingqiang only wanted early but was left dead, but forgot his hands tied, using a hemp rope instead of handcuffing; and the hemp rope was not just tied to him alone, but a string of people, and the other end of the rope was tightly held in the hands of the escorts. \\nHe was pulled up like a bucket from the well, and thrown into the rudder like a big fish caught by fishermen. The twine was soaked in the water of the river, tightly inlaid into the flesh, making the pain of the ten fingers numbness. \\nThis is an act of incrimination and disobedience. As a result, along the way, he never gave him a little easier room, but came to a big tie. At that time, he really regretted, not regretting the stupid act of suicide, but regretted that he did not ask to wear handcuffs at the time of departure. If you wear handcuffs, then he will be eternal, with fish and shrimp. \\n21, full taste of the bitter iron window\\nQian mingqiang has, of course, become a typical example of inmates in Pingyang County Detention Centers. Although he wrote an appeal with his own cultural knowledge, no one would be heeded. In prison, he was subjected to 'special' treatment: he was held in solitary confinement in a cell of more than three square metres, with no sunlight during the day, the ground was damp and musty, and he was barely able to breathe. Not allowed to lie down during the day, only from morning to night; and at night must be lying down, not allowed to sit up slightly adjusted. There are no books to read, and there are no people to talk, just sit dry all day long. He really hopes that other prisoners will be held in this little black house, even if someone quarrels, is 100 times stronger than the day at the end of this single shadow! \\nIn prison, only the standard of diet and other prisoners are treated equally. It is prescribed to eat 7.5 two rice per day, 2.5 two per meal, and occasionally eat sweet potatoes. He was young and strong, that rations were completely dissatisfied with the big and empty stomach, so he often wanted to eat sweet melon silk. Because sweet potato silk than the amount of rice per meal will be more, you can satisfy the sense of hunger. But in jail, everything has to be obeyed by someone else's arrangement, it's not for you. Dishes are good, eat yellow fish every day, because Binh Duong, yellow fish and more cheap, as long as 0.08 yuan a pound, but the number of poor, each meal only a small piece. He asked to eat greens, he could eat some more, but still did not get consent, because greens need 0.04 yuan a pound, each kilogram of greens can only be burned in a bowl, it is not as cheap as yellow fish. \\nHunger is difficult, if you can sleep well, sleep is not eating, but not allowed to sleep down, he can only look out the window to distract attention. There is nothing other than a small window above this little cell where birds can occasionally be seen flying over. Therefore, every day he looks forward to the arrival of wind time. Although his wind time is also carried out alone, no one can speak, nod, but you can see flying worms, butterflies, three or two road grass on the wall swinging in the wind; lucky, you can also see one or two lambs. Bleeding yelling walked. Only at this time will he feel that there is life in the world, will he strongly evoke his consciousness of life, how he envy these creatures, envy their freedom, envy them to live in the universe according to their own laws. \\nUnbearable loneliness, endless sorrow, he has nowhere to expose, can only write a sad verse on the saved handpaper. He has always had the talent of poetry, deep, and if these poems were to remain so far, they would have been touching. Unfortunately, this was not possible. It was soon discovered by the supervisors. In exchange, the poems also fought again. \\nNothing can be comforted, and his spiritual torture has reached the brink of despair of collapse. According to the rules, family members can visit prison once a month, but they cannot bring any suspicious necessities, even clothing and small quantities of food, are subject to strict inspection before th"

				"memoirContent": "ey can be allowed to deliver them. But his family is so difficult, the pressure left on his wife is too much, can her thin shoulders afford it? So, during a prison visit, Qian mingqiang said straight to his wife: 'Laughing Xian, my life is finished. You are less than 30 years old, you can also find a happy partner again. We are divorced! Just ask you to raise a few children, they are small, they are too poor...' He choked no longer. Song Xiaoxian replied simply: 'Ming Qiang, you don't think about it. You are assured that I will keep the kids good!' She also brought a message from her mother-in-law, saying that he was reassured that they would help laugh Xian to take care of the children. The mother-in-law also said, In the trial. Never bite others, everything yourself is, do not harm ah! The voice of the mother and daughter commanded him to add his desire to live in despair, and only in such an environment, made him deeply feel the value of affection. It is truly meritorious! \\nDetention was held for three and a half months before and after Binh Duong Detention Centre, predominantly awaiting approval from a higher level. During that period, whether or not you appeal, the superiors 'approval was only upheld, not to mention that Qian mingqiang was a typical disobedience to the law, let alone there would be little hope of reducing the sentence. \\nIn July 1967, he was escorted to Jinhua Shiliping Labour Farm, where he officially began his reformist career. \\n22, he was divided into labor from the strict team\\nJinhua Shiliping Farm is a famous labor farm in Zhejiang Province. In the ten miles of loess hills, Pingchou has many plants. If people do not notice that there are high walls, power grids and outposts on the outskirts of a building, it will be mistaken for a bustling township. \\nThere is a vibrant feeling of influx into the heart of the money. More than a hundred days of isolation from the world, he can see it all, and he feels very satisfied. After all the necessary formalities, he was sent to the prison team in accordance with the rules. This was created specifically for new prisoners. They are required to work for half a day, and the other half is studying. Learning is mainly about knowing your own crimes. Because only if you have a deep understanding of the seriousness of the crimes they have committed and the harm they bring to society, can they truly admit guilt, plead guilty and proactively reform in mind and in practice. \\nThis kind of days is quite easy. Although Qian mingqiang is a small intellectuator, after many years of honing, labor is very good, and the study of dance and ink is even more ridiculous. Learning experience is also, speaking, and reporting is set after another, and indeed has greatly improved in his thinking. He really pleaded guilty, served the law, and no longer wants to engage in the kind of fruitless above. \\nIn his accident, three months of study expired, he was rated as a learning activist. He was delighted to receive this honor in such environments, both psychologically and spiritually. At this time, another letter was received from his wife, saying, 'The family is safe and small. I hope that you will be well transformed, obey discipline, and strive to return home as soon as possible. The encouragement of his wife was tantamount to adding a sticker to him, and he was more active in studying and working. \\nAlthough he was rated as an activist, the study and labor of the prison team was only the 'starting education' stage before labor. According to the previous section he had committed suicide and had not loosened the string of 'class struggles', he was assigned to the sixth team-from the strict team to re-education. \\nThere is a big difference between the 'level' and 'treatment' from the strict team and from the light team. From the light brigade every day by correctional officers, what is carried out is free labor, that is to say, you can work according to your specialties and physical strength (of course, the same has the criteria for the assessment of whether labor is active, active and hard). The movement is also more liberal, and the workers whistle, and then the correctional staff will take back to the prison. \\nFrom the strict squad is also carried out every day by public security personnel, but must work within the designated Red Flag District, and you must be assigned unconditional obedience to what you do, and armed men are supervised around. The so-called Red Flag District refers to red flags around labor as a cordon line. No matter what reason, whoever takes a step in the red flag area, will kill regardless of whether. \\nThe seriousness of the crimes of these prisoners can be felt in the light of the harsh provisions alone, and that is true in terms of the membership assigned to the team. The team has a total of 214 people, including the KMT chief, head of the regiment, the Chinese Unionist and the army and other historical counter-revolutions. Among them, there are many officers of the collegial rank, as well as airborne agents who were caught alive after the liberation of the United States Chiang; in addition, they are some rapists, robbers, and murderers who have been caught alive after liberation. These people have been sentenced to death suspension and life imprisonment, the most of whom are sentenced to twenty years, and seven years are only one person who has money Mingqiang. In other words, he was one of the lightest criminals from the strict squad, and with his wisdom, of course he understood that he was the result of 'bad attitude' before entering prison. He is only the only road of light, honestly and honestly is the only road of light. Therefore, he reversed his previous 'cow's head carrying' temper, bitten his fingers and wrote a blood book, invited Chairman Mao to sin, and made his determination to work well and strive for his birth to become a man again. \\nHe was assigned to the position of head of the labour team, either because of his minor offence or because of his ideological and operational recognition by correctional officers. Although there is no administrative rank, the job is not so easy to do. At the very least, there is a need to take the lead in the revolution everywhere. For example, every time 'double robbery', there are indicators of whether it is to grab or grab rice. And he as a group of lengths must not do less, worse than others. So before the start of the 'double grab', he used the rest time, to transplanting rice and cut rice inmates humbly ask, simulation practice, until the real seedlings pulling or harvesting, he can operate both hands at the same time, and fast. The action itself, it is invisible to drive the whole team enthusiasm, plus he is good at encouraging, every time you always send you chase me, until the end of the 'double robbery' victory, from the strict team to the top. He himself was commended by the General Assembly. However, to be honest, the praise is really hard to come, ah, after the daily release of work, Qian mingqiang's two legs are fat like buckets, and they are like lead, dragged down, lying down on a wooden bed, the whole body is like a scattered rack, even the strength to turn over is gone. \\nHe holds back and never hum. Verily He at this time is true to transforming himself. When the reservoir was built in the winter, in the face of a thin ice reservoir water, to dig up the muddy spade from it, the prisoners put their eyes on him, he bitten his teeth, he took the spade, 'flutter' a led jump off the water, and dug up the mud. Relentless Northwest wind attack, like thousands of steel needles straight into the bones, let him keep digging, the upper and lower teeth are still trembling against the ground, even the lips bite, this whole body wet clothes, simply can't resist the cold, heartfelt pain ah! But he still took the lead until he went on to work. \\nSuch heavy labor, of course, needs sufficient energy supply to support the living. Although the supply of food rations on labour farms has increased compared to weekdays during the busy season, the dishes are rarely oily, and thus the feeling of hunger strikes at times, and they pay the greatest labour intensity, and this feeling is particularly strong. But he still holds back, and at every meal, always the last one to cook, often less in the amount of meals than those in front. Qian mingqiang was originally a more burdensome person (now weighing 87 kilograms), but at that time he actually had only 46 kilograms thin, it was really to the point of 'skinny bones like firewood'. \\nIt's all his willingly. Correctional officers, of course, were seen in their eyes, and as a result he was given a new 'concession': reassigned as the head of study. This position for him is really 'handy', the main task is to compile blackboard, write experience, write comments, report on learning. He can also write, and can say that every final report is well organized, and theory and practice are combined; blackboard newspaper has a distinct theme, active layout, and graphic, has become a bright landscape in the prison. \\nThree months, just three months, his exemplary role and talent brought him a new harvest: he became the leader of the big group. \\nDo not underestimate this position, but in prison, one hundred miles will get it in turn. Because he has the dazzling 'special treatment':\\nHave the right. Supervises the labour distribution of 214 persons in the whole team. Every day, who comes to the field, who dig, who pick up\\nWho is the cart, what this does, what he does, it's up to him to say. \\nFull release. Every day, the only job is to set up a security area, and every job, it begins to put red flags according to the regulations, 14 red flags have been inserted, and a day's work is done. In addition, he stood on the side for advocacy when other prisoners were sweating and raining. This is simply not a labor, but it resembles a correctional officer who has completed his sentence. \\nSpecial life enjoyment. From the strict team 214 inmates live in a large room, beds are bunk beds, 25 beds per row, 50 people, a total of 4 rows, so it seems very crowded, each can only divide to 60 centimeters of bunk, so some prisoners often fight for a little space and fight. And Qian mingqiang, the leader of the group, has 110 centimeters of bunk, and a 'desk'-that's a wooden box that is the size of a soap box. \\nIt is no wonder that everyone has seen everyone envy. \\n23, he made a medical colleague close friend\\nThe path of life is really unpredictable. Many years later, Qian mingqiang turned out to be a famous doctor in the whole country, and for a long period of years he had not only supported the family, but also laid the foundation for him to start a new career in the future. According to him, 'I am a doctor who was cultivated in a labour farm and received patient recognition in practice.' \\nThe ability to train doctors on a labour farm has to be attributed to a prisoner who is a doctor in itself. The prisoner was named Lin Wenchang. He graduated from Nanjing Medical College. He was assigned to Ningbo Medical University. He was also very handsome. He soon became a professor and director of obstetrics and gynaecology. Young, intelligent medical, female colleagues, female patients frequently favored. It also facilitated his repeated mistakes in gender relations. In the month of that year, this was the manifestation of 'corruption and decay', 'extremely serious bourgeoisie thought,' and that's what the bad elements of the five categories were prepared for. Not only wearing a hat, but also strict sentencing. As a result, he was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. He was taken to Shiliping to work from the strict team and to work as a doctor in the air \\nHis bunk in the cell just next to Qian mingqiang. When both understood each other's bottom, Qian mingqiang suddenly developed an idea: why not take this opportunity to learn some medicine and medicine from him? Because at that time there was a provision in the prison: to read books, only Ruby books could be read, except for some professional books related to business. At that time, Lin Wenchang had a lot of medical books and medicine books around because he wanted to see the prisoners. \\nOf course, Qian mingqiang wants to learn medicine and have a deeper idea: first, his family is very poor. None of the whole family is eating public food, neither wages nor labor insurance. Now, after going back to school, in the future, the wife and daughter are sick, they will no longer have to spend money to go to a doctor. Second, he learns the hand of medicine, and can be a barefoot doctor when you go back, saying it may be better than them, so that they can often serve poor farmers, and can also be less criticized. \\nTo ask man, it shall be applied to men first. By virtue of his role as leader of the group, Qian mingqiang always picked him easily every time he was assigned labor, and allowed him to retire early and half an hour later. The reason for this is: it is convenient for Lin Wenchang to work two hours less than other inmates a day. Of course, he was impressed by the attention of this big team leader. They became friends with no words. \\nIn this way, as long as he has free time, he gnaws as hungry the medical books, medicine books and letters brought by Lin Wenchang, and also wrote to his wife, asking her to buy some medical books in order to facilitate her study. \\nKung Fu does not bear the heart. A few months later, when the prisoners came back from work and queued up for medical treatment, he was already able to act as Lin Wenchang's assistant. Some prisoners are really sick, and many are fake medical numbers, they are not sick at all. They just want to add some throat slices, both cool and sweet, can solve glutton. Qian mingqiang did not impress them. He only wanted to seize the time for more clinical practice and actively assist Lin Wenchang to paint red mercury, rub iodine wine, needle, hang large bottles, etc. \\nLin Wenchang, who was born from Kebau, was indeed a rare medical and sophisticated doctor in prison. Even public security cadres and their families were willing to ask him to see a doctor. Soon, he moved from the 6th Squadron to the Farm Headquarters Infirmation Unit to serve as a attending physician. After he left, Qian mingqiang, logically, became a doctor among 214 prisoners. \\nAt that time, the farm provided that any prisoner who took sick leave, the doctor could only make recommendations, permit or not, and must have the approval of a large group leader. He is both a big team leader and a team doctor. He has great power and authority, and is simply red and purple. All the prisoners served him, and saw him all nodded. However, Qian mingqiang is aware of the situation of 'the same as the end of the fall', and never used it to take a shelf and arouse the prisoner. He remains very humble and meticulous about his professional study and practice. This is due to his personality. He is a person who is serious about everything, or he does not do it, he has to do it well, to do it with significant results. Thus, out of 214 prisoners, anyone is sick, regardless of the illness. He all looked, tooth pain, ears, head sores, pus of legs, were treated seriously. As a result, the prisoners received unanimous praise, and they paid more respect to this big team leader. \\nThe prisoners were thankful to him, but suffered from the constraints of conditions. Later, I didn't know it was the head of the patient, and the big group leader was able to eat nutrients often. It was stated in the field that all prisoners living in a seriously ill ward could receive revolutionary humanitarian care: patients were allowed to buy nutrition at their own expense, or to allow their families to send them. And every time this time, Qian mingqiang's bedside will always have a share. \\nOccasionally, some prisoners die of illness or injury at work, and take on his own initiative the task of burying. This is a righteous act, and at the same time there is some remuneration. The field rules: burial return can drink some wine, the wine is made on its own. You can also eat two eggs. This can be considered a special enjoyment in the labour force. Not to mention that Qian mingqiang has a unique affair of wine, and in general, inmates are strictly forbidden to drink alcohol. And, at that time, they had a dose of two and half per meal, and they could receive three and a half pounds per meal for sweet potatoes. Many inmates with little appetite gave him excess. All this confirms the truth: the hearts of people are flesh long. There are many people who know grace, and less ungrateful. Even the prisoners behind bars are no exception. \\n24. Strive for early release\\nIn correctional farms, except for those who are intransigent and unable to repent, almost none of the inmates who do not wish to seek commutation of their sentence, can be released from prison to return home earlier. There are also clear provisions in the labour and reform departments that as long as they perform well and are positive, they can receive preferential treatment for the reduction of sentences. The specific methods used by them are: according to labor, study, life, attendance, compliance with the law, legal compliance, and work, etc., and so on, they can reduce their sentences by one day, long years. Early release can be deducted from the original sentence. Of course, those who do not perform well will receive a reduction penalty, and if so often, there is no hope of commutation of sentence. \\nThe introduction of this provision has indeed greatly contributed to the motivation of prisoners to work, and a typical example of early release is at times hitting their hearts. These days, Qian mingqiang is in this mood. The reason was that two prisoners whose crimes were more serious than him had been released earlier. \\nThat evening, the management convened a meeting of all prisoners from the strict squad. After reading out the strict policy during the labor reform period, he announced publicly: Due to active labor, learning efforts, good performance in all aspects, approved by the superiors to give early release! \\nThe prisoners made a warm applause and an envy expression was revealed on one face. \\nQian mingqiang quietly asked a prisoner next to him: 'What sin did he commit?' \\n'Rape a young girl!' \\n'This is a great sin. How many years was it?' \\n'Life imprisonment.' \\nQian Ming clang clang, 'can also be released early for life?' \\n'You're not coming long, so do not know. He has commuted his sentence once and commuted to 15 years' imprisonment from life. This is the second time!' \\nThe power of example is endless. All life imprisonment can be released early, not to mention that he was only seven years in prison. He was thrilled this night and gave him great confidence in a positive transformation, and he was determined to reach this exciting moment with more sweat. \\nTherefore, in addition to the outstanding work of team leader and team doctor, he also organized culturally talented people among prisoners to perform literary performances every time fake programs such as New Year's Day, Spring Festival, May Day, National Day, etc. He is both a director and a screenwriter, and sometimes in person, with a new show on each performance, receiving praise and praise from leaders and prisoners. But he never attributed that credit to himself. He always said: 'The program is so good, one is the excellent performance of the actors, and the second is to rely on some strong assistance.' This one is also a prisoner of the team, formerly the director of Ruian Yue Theatre Company. In addition to the director, he is very good, and he is a hometown of Wenzhou. The relationship between the two people on weekdays is better, once there is a literary performance task, the two people always together to compile a program, sometimes together to compile the blackboard newspaper. \\nHis active hardship, his humble learning, his care and love everywhere played an exemplary role, in his more than four years of team leader from the strict team, the spiritual face really changed greatly. There is an internal message outgoing: he will be released early. \\nAt this moment, how excited he is! Although it has not yet been officially announced, not only others seem, it is to think from beginning to end, this possibility is like three fingers grabbing a conch-a solid! \\nHe has even been reckoned in his heart: Seeing the Spring Festival of 1972 is approaching, after the Spring Festival, he can return to his hometown. Have they lived well since they left their homes in March 1967 and have not been close to their wives and children for four years? How much tall do the children grow? How do you read? Did his hometown take a look and ask yourself, his heart has flown out of prison and flew to the homeland of that dream. \\nHowever, a disaster that he had not even dreamed of suddenly dropped, completely extinguishing his dream of early release! \\n25, villain informing, dream burst\\nFebruary 2, 1972 is New Year's Eve. Farm prisoners are gathering at dinner. The dishes are extremely hearty with meat, fish, eggs, and various kinds of fried vegetables. Many patients know that the big team leader is about to go, and have given him good dishes to thank him for it. \\nAfter dinner, each person also sent two pounds of sugar. Then the party ended until 10 p.m. Everyone was happy to return to the cell and slept with confidence, because it was stated that there was no work at the beginning of the year. \\nWell, I know that because of the dinner too much, Qian mingqiang, and the performance was cool, suddenly diarrhea, and burned up again. In order not to affect others, he was strong enough to sleep until the second half of the night. \\nAt that time, a bleak yell was made in the prison, and more than 200 prisoners were awakened and asked, 'What's the matter? What happened?' \\nAs the head of the team, he is responsible for ascertaining the situation. He struggled his body with a full weakness, and got up straight to a bunk of weird sounds. It is now 5 o'clock in the morning. \\nThe prisoner who was burdened was originally a major general in the KMT troops, surnamed Wang, was a thin and small old man. He sentenced him to death and later changed to life. Weekdays are not loud and seem careful. \\nQian mingqiang approached a look, but saw Wang's old man had some blisters on his mouth. Ask him what happened? He said, 'When I was bright, there was some hungry in my belly, thought of the sugar sent last night, he reached out to grab a pinch into his mouth, originally wanted to solve the glutton, that know and bitter, bitter and bitter, sore mouth blistering immediately! I, I'm scared, can not help but shout!' \\n'Blame, how is this?' Qian mingqiang immediately hands to view sugar. \\nDo not check, a check is not up to the heart, the original Wang's two packs of sugar has become two packs of lime, was transferred! \\n'It's still got!' He quickly called all the prisoners and took out the sugar to be checked. Upon finding the bedside of a surname, he saw that sugar minds were sprinkled around, and his two pounds of sugar were also much more than others. \\nThis, immediately caused the public indignation of the prisoners, and shouted: 'The leader of the big group, seriously deal with him!' \\n'Hang him up and beat!' Qian mingqiang drank: 'You are really thief don't change!' \\nOriginally, this surname was a habit of stealing, and he did not change it repeatedly, and had committed a lot of crimes, and was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. Qian mingqiang was too gracious, coupled with the physical discomfort, fire and gas, with the assistance of other inmates, soon tied up his surname, hammered on the stall, so that until 8:00 in the morning, the Correctional Captain came to put him down, and then held a plenary meeting and engaged in a fierce crackdown. \\nAnd he knew that he had since planted a curse. His surname hated his teeth and cut his teeth and kept an eye on his every move in secret, in order to wait for a chance to take revenge. \\nTwo or three days have passed, no movement. Qian mingqiang is still fever, diarrhea. The captain told him not to work. 'No, as long as I can't climb up in pain, I still have to go to the site!' So, he still insisted on taking the team out of work, and once assigned everyone's labor tasks, he rushed to a secluded place to pull his belly. \\nAt that time, he suddenly saw two men in prison uniforms in distant walking towards the homes of the ordinary people. There are strict rules on the farm: prisoners serving their sentences are not allowed to move around nearby farmers' homes. As a large group leader in his heart in a hurry, hurry out a note book in the bag, tear down the next page as a handpaper, wandering the ass, side pants to run to stop. When rushed to the farmer's house, it was only clear that this was the two workers who had already been released from prison. Because they did not replace the coat, they went to the common people's homes to contact the people in their past clothes. Qian mingqiang put down a heart and explained a few words to the two people before returning to the construction site with confidence. \\nHe dreamed of not thinking, this paper broke a great deal! \\nOriginally, since he was the leader of the large group, it has sent him a working manual. Like all notebooks of that era, Chairman Mao's quotes are printed on the cover, and Chairman Mao's quotes are also included in the inserts. This book is a symbol of treatment for Qian mingqiang. He can be described as not to leave for a moment. Any meeting, instructions from supervisors, daily labor, study, life, etc. are not too troublesome to remember above. \\nIn a hurry that day, he tear off a page of paper at hand, and he had to tear off the inserts with quotations. At that time, he never thought about the serious consequences of the matter. He knew that when he went to chase those two people, he had long been watching his every move, and came immediately to see, and he should have something to do, and actually found him. \\nThis is a serious political problem! On the platform can be formed into existing counter-revolutionaries. After the farm leaders get the report of his surname, immediately find money 'talk' by Ming Qiang. Qian mingqiang thought: this is finished, not only can not reduce the sentence, say no more sin will be added! Well, after the farm leader learned the reason, came to a network open side, and did not hold a conference to fight, but asked him to make a deep inspection. But he was clearly told that he could not be released early because of the importance of the matter. \\nThis change greatly shocked him, so that he had some deeper thinking about life, and he was focused on learning medical technology. His big team leader was also, of course, replaced. It was in 1973, and one year left before he was released from prison. \\nClose to the country more frightening, afraid to ask people\\nOn March 30, 1974, spring began, and he also ushered in his spring-released according to his sentence. \\nHe is a rare talent, and the leader of Shiliping Farm repeatedly welcomed him to stay as a doctor. Those who have completed their sentences have all the rights and obligations of Chinese citizens and are also able to receive more than 30 yuan of wages per month. This was not a small number at that time, but the official cadres of the country had a lot lower than his wages, but those who could get 50 yuan or more were far-fetched. Moreover, vegetables, meat, poultry eggs are cheap, and the breadwinner is more than enough. \\nHe was moved, and wanted to come down, and he wrote this idea to his wife, but his wife categorically disagreed. The reason is simple, as long as the whole family can be together, again tired and willing. \\nTherefore, he declined the invitation to the farm and left as scheduled. Indeed, the leadership gave him care, and specifically authorized him to take away a batch of medical instruments such as scalpel, tweezers, syringes and some commonly used medicines. He was also given a new set of cotton padding pants and a four-pound quilt, which was a special care for those who left the prison sentence. \\nChunyang shone, Ying fly grass long, he picked a bag with covered, books luggage, embarked on the road of hometown. \\nBy train and by car, his distance from his hometown was shortened. But the closer to home, the more his excitement is timid. 7 years, the whole 2555 days, the change of hometown is not big? How do your wife and children live? What is the attitude of the left neighbor towards him? How to support your family after going home? A series of question marks coinded around the mind, and they couldn't get away. Among them, the most worrying thing was his wife's attitude towards him, because in seven years, the wife's letter was just a few short words, only a few words, and called him a good transformation, and no other news from it. His wife is not highly educated and has difficulty writing long letters. Of course, he can understand, but she knows nothing about exactly how she thinks in her heart. People on the road come to people, and he even dare not to stop and learn from the villagers about the situation in his home. The poem 'closer to the country is more frightening, afraid to ask people', is his true portrayal at that time. \\nWith suspicion, he timidly stepped into the four-walled, ventilated old house of Jinxiang. Cry for his wife and wife to see, shouting children silent, his heart 'Gden' a cool half cut. Fortunately, very quickly came out of the person from the inside and stopped looking, it turned out to be his raw mother Xia's. He shouted 'Mom', and the old lady stumbled with him, choked: 'Oh, I really want to be a blind man, I'm still worried that I can't see you again in this life...' Seven years old, Mom is 70 years old, but looks good. Qian mingqiang looked forward to a while, nervously asked: 'What about laughing fairy and children? They...' Mama saw her son's worries at a glance and smiled and said, 'All good, all good, they live in the eighth lane house!' \\n'Eighth Lane House, they have another home?' He was nervous again. \\n'Silly children, don't guess, is laughing Xian to eat and spend money, a house.' \\nRaw mother is the end of tea, but also burned snack, busy. But he wanted to see his wife and his children, and he seemed restless. At that time, the three children came, they were called by the grandmother, and Grandma grinned, 'Who are you looking at? Don't call Dad yet?' He went up with excitement, but no one dared to get close to him except the eldest son Annan gently shouted 'Dad'. Bi"

				"memoirContent": "g daughter Rui Juan (now renamed Cui Juan), 15 years old, has grown into a big girl, Ting Ting Yu standing aside, no sound, a pair of big eyes with her mother, full of fear. And the younger son of Quiz did not know the father at all, but looked at him curiously with his big eyes. \\nHe was ashamed of this happy and sad scene, and the children were innocent, all his fault and tortured and hurt their young hearts. He swore in his heart: 'Dear children, I will never leave you again. I will cherish and care for you. I will do my best to make up for the failure of a father to make your life happier. \\nIt is said that the heart of the fathers and their children are connected, because they have inseparable blood affection. Sure, just a little bit of silence, the children began to live up, and under the guidance of their grandma, they took the hands of their father to the dwelling of the eighth lane. \\nHe can't believe his eyes. Is it his own home? Like the five houses of Regal House, neat, spacious, bright hall, room with two doors cabinet, large bed, kitchen with fish, shrimp and many other dishes. Needless to say, it was all during his seven years of re-education. It was added by his wife, because before he reformed, everything that could be sold in the house except that four-walled and ventilated old house was sold. \\nIn the face of this situation, he is looking forward to the appearance of his wife, asking in detail how she survived these years and supported the family. He's not as good as her! But the wife has never appeared, he is more confused, and dare not ask the child, cloudy clouds began to envelope his heart...\\nIt's not easy to boil until the evening. Song Xiaoxian finally appeared at the door of the house, along with a man and a woman. 'Are you back?' With a greeting to him, he went to another room to talk to the people. He is even more a monk who does not touch his mind, and dare to follow it, in addition to being alone, no way to show. \\nVery hard waiting! Until the night was quiet, the wife sent away the guests, and handled all the urgent matters, did not come to him with a smile. \\nQian Ming clang heart big stone landing, in the intersection of feelings, the heart has surged the passion for a long time. He pulled his wife to sit down and stroked her shoulders with his hands, trembling and said, 'Laughing fairy. Thank you for your love for me, admiring your superman's endurance, this long seven years, you can live with children, but also hold the family so well, really call me five bodies!' \\n'Couple, still have to say such kind words?' Song Xiaoxian said calmly. \\n'No, I can't but say, I must say, although the sea is deep, the mighty hundred times deep ah!' I couldn't help but shed tears of ashamed and gratitude. 'You tell me these seven years of hard years, and I will remember your grace all my life.' \\nSo the wife said slowly, and he listened quietly to his wife. \\nWeak shoulders, provoke the kilo\\nUsing family members to describe Qian mingqiang's home situation after his reformations is never too good. At that time, Song Xiaoxian still had 1,000 yuan in cash on hand. This was saved by the couple at great risk of running a single gang. Just after Qian mingqiang left, he was taken several hundred yuan by his friends in the name of repaying the debt. Then the death of the younger son was spent part of the funeral; about two or 300 yuan left was the source of life for the family of the money family. But Song Xiaoxian is a strong woman. She would rather starve herself. She also had to use this savings to raise three children, so she used this savings for her capital money to do business. \\nShe does anything business, put sugar plates, sell halogen, even secretly buy and sell food tickets, cloth tickets... as long as there is rope head to earn, she is not tired of doing it. The eldest daughter Ruijuan is very knowledgeable, in order to allow her mother to do business with peace of mind, she took care of the chores at home, and also helped to take care of two younger brothers. His birth mother also often came to help take care of children. However, it is not easy to maintain the life of a family. The soft shoulders of Song Xiaoxian have become harder and more difficult and fast to hold up. At this time, 'affection' showed a huge role, especially in the era of class struggle, the inspirational effect of this kind of 'affection' on people is It is difficult to measure: the birth mother, Mrs. Xia's, come to care for the old and weak, to take care of the whole family's children. Qian mingqiang's brother, Peng, also rushed to support his sister-in-law with the money he earned from doing business in Jinxiang. Song's mother and his brother, Principal Song, were rushed to make a strong contribution and money, and repeatedly encouraged Song Xiaoxian to keep this house up, 'Stay in the mountains, not afraid to burn firewood'. Song Xiaoxian in this kind of affectionate hug, excitement and tears: 'Please rest assured, I have to live again, and I will be rewarded for your grace a day!' \\nShe said to do it, for this crumbling home, in order to be able to make a good day, she was almost crazy, what disease ah, ah pain ah, what wind and rain, she all threw her head behind her head. So, for seven full years, with the help of her loved ones, she not only did not beat, but also with hard work, the day slowly got better, not only did she code a house in the 8th Lane, but also had a deposit in the bank. \\n'My loved ones are my backrest, without the help of my loved ones, I can stand, and can't boil up.' Song Xiaoxian said. \\nOn March 29, 1997, the author, accompanied by Song Xiaoxian, traveled to Jinxiang and her mother's family to interview her brother Principal Song. \\nSong Chang, who lives at 41 Jinxiang East Street, 52 years old, is the general manager of an ink factory. He has all the peculiar economic minds of Wenzhou people, and has money. When his son married a few years ago, a guy spent 500,000 yuan. This is simply an astronomical figure for the working class. And he laughed and said, 'At this time, ah, at this time, ah, we also did not dare to dream in that bitter years, ah, my family could only be in barely fed. However, after the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the Party was held, the situation can be different. The whole Wenzhou suddenly came up alive. Together with the Party's policy of reform and opening up, we are like a fish getting water, the more prosperous the business, the more flourishing, millionaires abound, so getting married, buying new homes, filling household appliances, spending under the flowers 560,000 yuan is normal.' \\n'When your sister lived so hard, it was entirely caused by Qian mingqiang, how did you not mobilize her for divorce?' The author opens the door to ask. \\n'We never thought about this. After her brother-in-law sent to reform, the sister's mind was suffering enough. Not to mention that she had three children, and then called her to divorce, wouldn't it be worse!' 'We know Qian mingqiang, he is not a bad guy, he will have a break in the future,' Song said. Besides, our Jinxiang has always paid special attention to the homeland, affection, friends have difficulty, all think about ways to help, not to mention our sister. So then we preferred to save their own frugal, survive in the seam, nor can we let the sister family to overwhelm the burden of life!' \\nThis is the answer of a former ordinary farmer who is now one of the beneficiaries of reform and opening up. What a simple and human touch he said! \\nThe next day, we went to Qian mingqiang's daughter's home to interview again. She and her husband settled in Dragon Harbor. We were sitting in the private car 'Santana' of Qian mingqiang's eldest son. Not much time, we saw Cui Juan standing at the door to meet us. This is a three-storey new building with scaffolding lined, listening to laughter Xian said, is being raised to five floors, so it seems a bit messy after entering the door. Cui Juan's husband Mr. Wang Renbin is burying his head to design the model, originally he opened a family signage factory. Without asking more, we know that her family has also been considerable in these years, otherwise, it will be difficult to rise on the ground. \\nCui Juan has long learned from our mother's phone call. After receiving a warm hospitality, she opened her door to talk about how the family was changed in that year. \\n'I was born in Ryan. Originally called Peng Ruijuan, about 6 years old, returned to Jinxiang, changed my name with my father, and later called Cui Juan.' She did not slowly say it. \\nOriginally, when Qian mingqiang went to labor, she was eight years old. In the city, children of this age still lie in their mother's arms. But she cited the phrase in practice: 'Children of the poor head home early.' She saw her mother in order to maintain this crumbling home, running in the rain and doing small business, it was too hard. \\n'Mom, I don't want to go to study anymore. Help you two brothers!' She sincerely said that tone was like an adult. \\n'Children, books can't read, people have no culture to eat, and then, how do I tell him after your father comes back?' Song Xiaoxian said around her daughter. \\nMother and daughter can't hold, and the reasonable grandma knew this afterwards and came to them and said to them, 'This is good, I help you take care of your brother when you're reading, and your family affairs are all under your control when you're on vacation. It's called reading and housework.' \\nUncle also came after knowing: 'All three children have to read, can't stop school, financially I will try to help you!' \\nSo, this family was kept under the full support of the affection. In addition, Song Xiaoxian has experience in doing small businesses. Despite their hard work, their family lives are better than their left neighbors. So one of the three children did not pull to school, and they all performed well. Only when they came to high school, they ran into a roadblock stone: because of poor family composition, they could not enter Jinxiang secondary school. They had to go to remote mountain villages wearing hats high school to study. \\n'For this situation, we can all adapt without complaint. But what is most uncomfortable and palpitations for me is the mental and psychological stress that my father's problems bring to our little mind.' She said here, the eye circles began to get wet. \\nIn that particular age, the relationship between people was extremely abnormal. The most afraid of Qian Ruijuan is the school asking her to fill out the form On weekdays, she has a good homework, get along with the classmates and very harmonious, but the form is filled, teacher or classmates, met her far away; and some students often in attitude, eyes, action is very obvious to her discrimination. At this time, she sneakly crying in places invisible to people. \\nAs a result, the two brothers created a counter-insurgency. As long as whoever dares to say they are black five categories, dogs, they pull their punches, and they fight, whether they won't win, they will have to desperately. The result will of course be criticized by teachers and classmates, but also because of the fights became famous, no one dared to bully them later. Moreover, after all, the classmates were simply, many students admire the courage of their brother's desperate Sanuro, and made good friends with them. When Qian mingqiang was released home, it was the turn of five categories of molecules to dig gutters, dig ground and other painstaking work, he personally encountered such things: the eldest son greeted, there would be many classmates to help him complete his labor tasks without fear. \\nThe most bitter is Song Xiaoxian. Although folks saw her a woman living with three children, most people were sympathetic, and even someone secretly paid and helped her. But there are very few people who want to take a plane to bully her. \\nAt that time, they lived in the old house for six years, and in those six years, they often had a verdict with their neighbours because of the aisles of the old house. And this neighbor is easy to offend: women work in the Food Control Institute, they are resident cadres, and their husband works in Wenzhou department stores, and is also state cadres. In that capacity, she proposed that Song Xiaoxian free up the aisle, on the grounds that she had obstructed her house to accumulate debris. \\n'This aisle has been used by my home, freed up, where do so many people live in my home?' Song Xiaoxian certainly disagrees. \\nThis annoyed the resident cadre, and even secretly contacted a players' idle and came to bully her. \\nThis person is named Li Jinzao. His father was the Qianfu housekeeper of Youjia, who was familiar with Qian mingqiang from an early age and often played together. After liberation, Chanfu's house was split off during the land reform, and his father died, and he moved to Jinxiang and lived in a short house behind Pengjiada's house. Because he was idle, he became a second-class unwilling to support himself, often doing some sneaky chicken dog hook, so he was sentenced, but because of his good origin, he was poor farmer, was the object of dependence at that time and was released soon. According to reason, he should have a close relationship with the money family, and do his ability to give some help when the family is suffering. However, he did not do this. Instead, at the instigation of that resident cadre, he had made it even worse for the money family to come. \\nIt was a dark night with no fingers, and the children had fallen asleep. Song Xiaoxian is still sewing up the children's broken clothes under the bean-like lights. At this time, only listen to the fence door 'tapping' a sound, a shadow quickly ran into the room, a hug she wanted to do indecent. Song Xiaoxian took a look through the lights. It turned out to be Li Jinzao. She took a breath, because Li was an impoverished farmer, and did not dare to offend, even if he cried out for help loud. Because people will not come to believe a complaint from a counter-revolutionary family, the result can only be a bad reputation. \\nIs it possible for him to succeed with his grudge? Of course no. If he was so easy, she would have changed her divorce. Because she always had only one money in her heart. \\n'Brother into the stove, do you deserve the money that grew up from childhood?' She exhorts and exhorts, 'The money family used to treat you not thin, and to speak of conscience for people.' \\n'Did you wait like that?' \\n'I already have three more children, I can only have the core and wait for Ming Clang back!' Song Xiaoxian said, 'You are still young, your wife is sick again, go back, and be rewarded for doing such a lack of morality.' \\n'This... then you will free up the aisle for Aunt Jo Di, and I will never come back to you again.' \\na word of relief. Song Xiaoxian immediately replied: 'You are giving her a gun to make ah, okay, look in your face, I will definitely consider it.' \\nLi Jinzao was stuffed, hesitant not to leave yet. Song Xiao Xiao Xianling machine move: 'You go quickly, I have to call the plastician to help my house brush the walls.' Said, Song Xiaoxian came out of the door and took the opportunity to escape to the house of a neighbor who made mud next door. \\nSong Xiaoxian escaped a robbery, but he has also had one more heart disease ever since. So she thought that she saved the money from doing business, determined to have a house in the eighth lane, avoiding the trouble caused by Aunt Mao Di, but also freed from Li Jinjiao's harassment again. \\nPersonal practice, causing woes\\nDarkness is still not in the past, the big print and slogans of the street and alleyways still ringing all over the world, the approval of forest approval hole again climax. All this is already an outsider for Qian mingqiang, because he does not have the right to participate in the movement, let alone touching this 'high pressure line' again. In addition to the residential area holding a critical meeting, he wants him to fight for accompany, or regularly participate in the work of five categories of elements, he is honest at home. What makes him worried is that he is not more worthwhile than staying at work. He had to think to raise the burden of the family in order to thank his wife for his grace and the children's expectations for him. \\nHe cannot teach, let alone be entitled to restore cadre status in order to obtain a meager salary. His only way out would be to re-engage in his own business: selling Chinese herbs and giving medical attention. \\nBut he did not dare to act. It is only by reporting ideas, turning around and proposing their own ideas for a living. To his surprise, the acquiescence of the authorities concerned had been obtained. \\nLater, he knew from someone else that at that time all units and departments were dedicated to: the wave of the 'cultural revolution', hospitals were no exception. If a large gold township is not only lacking medicine, no one can inject muscle needles, let alone injecting intravenous needles and hanging large bottles. \\nIn July 1974, the summer summer came, when people were sweaty walking on the streets of Jinxiang, they were surprised and surprised to find under the roof of the street, a table, a stethoscope, blood pressure syringe and some Chinese and Western medicines. A burdensome lang sitting at the table is giving the patient a vigorous consultation. \\nThis is the early stage of Chin's Clinic. \\nQian mingqiang treats patients unusually kindly, asking, smelling, looking out, meticulous, how to use the medicine is even more clear, adding that he will play muscle needles, and he will hang brine water. This is a great technology in Jintang, where medicine was scarce at that time, and he often took the initiative to visit service. As a result, the name of Dr. Qian began to pass to the streets and alleys, and even many rural people came to the clinic. He turned out to be on the street every morning. He went home in the afternoon to deal with some domestic chores, but some patients simply came to the door in the afternoon, and he had to throw away other matters. Half a month later, the private clinic was temporarily rented to the city. A doctor who could only be called 'Herbal Lang Nakaka' at the time. It is not easy to get such a word of mouth effect. The reason, of course, the most say is those who have seen the disease and have taken medication. \\n'The money doctor has a good attitude towards the patient, the medical technique is smart, and the fee is low.' Some patients say that. \\n'It is true, but I think the most prominent of him is having a loving heart, bashing on the patient, only forgetting himself.' More people praised this way. \\nIt is true. One afternoon, a bamboo bed carrying a patient rushed to the money home. \\n'The money doctor, doctor money, he's getting off, please save his life!' Accompanying family cries. \\nQian mingqiang opened the cover towards the patient and did not feel sucked a bite of air conditioner. But see this is an old old man who has been blue and purple and has stopped breathing. He quickly pulled out the stethoscope to the patient's chest and had a slight heartbeat, and the throat sometimes made a 'rush' sound. \\nQian mingqiang immediately diagnosed a pause caused by sputum obstruction! Family members are even said to be. \\nBut where is the suction device in the countryside? In this emergency juncture, but see Qian mingqiang did not hesitate to bend to the old man, bitterly sucked, a bite after bite of sputum leaves out of his mouth, to the fifth mouth, only saw the elderly issued a long moan, breathing smooth, the face also slowly turned to normal. \\nThe patient's family 'flutter' kneeling on the ground: 'Money doctor, my father's life is giving, we can't forget you all the life!' Tears come down as rain. \\nQian mingqiang quickly raised up his family and said humbly: 'Don't do this, don't do this. Saving death and injury is originally the doctor's duty!' \\nAnother thing that was both moving and outrageous happened: the 5-year-old son of a local brigade secretary, unfortunately suffered from segmental necrotizing enterocolitis. Peritonitis was complied with due to failure to take care of the hospital in time. The disease cannot eat, pull out, abdominal pain such as a knife, how can this child afford it? Brigade secretary rushed the child to the district hospital for rescue. What know the hospital refused to accept, but also froze out a sentence: 'Cure not well, prepare him for the aftermath!' \\nBrigade secretary sad through the top, can only hold the last line of hope sent to Qian's apartment. Qian mingqiang was the son of the secretary, and was on the verge of death, to be honest, and was worried at that time. When the secretary saw this, he encouraged: 'Old money, the child sees a bad cure, you can rest assured that the daring treatment, I will not complain about you!' With this sentence of the secretary, he was boldly, he came to a 'dead horse as a living horse doctor': first enema, then infusion, both taking Western medicine, and eating Chinese herbs, took out the eighteen martial arts he learned in his life, finally appeared miracle, the child was not only pulled back from the death line, but also in his careful care Then, getting better, finally gave the brigade secretary a freshly bouncing son. Brigade secretary and family members were moved to know what it was good. After they moved, they vented all their frustration to the district hospital. To get there, scolding them as 'quack doctors', is an 'irresponsible attitude towards the people's newspaper', or even 'pit the people', 'Kao Kan life', 'called the national hospital, medicine is not as good as a tulang, who dares to come to you in the future?' \\nHe was not allowed to do so at the hospital, because they did not take responsibility. But how can they endure a 'Tsuro's' medical surgeries over the hospital? So, when they were angry, they reflected on the head of Qian mingqiang, and a phone call to 'do it': 'Qian mingqiang is illegally practising medicine, is digging up the foot of the big socialist hospital, how do you care?' \\n'Doing' is really strong and popular. On the same day, money Mingqiang's home was copied, and all medicines and equipment were confiscated. The reason is that the hospital says two articles: 'illegal practice of medicine' and 'digging the feet of socialism.' \\nAfter all, it was a Communist Party led People's Republic, although in those years of non-upside down, the hearts and hearts of the people were deeply entrenched. After the investigation of the 'running' personnel, the hospital lies do not attack themselves. What they listen to each other is the general praise from the people to doctor Qian and that unclear and inexhaustible act of good. He has never done a violation except for no State-owned or collective signboards, and in the vast majority of cases he conducts free medical consultations and services free of charge. \\n'Let it go, let it go!' Investigators said. \\n'Do it' borrow the stairs downstairs: 'Qian mingqiang, you can serve the people, subjective motivation is still good. However, it is not legal to open a private clinic, and you go back and think about a way!' \\nObedient, smart Qian mingqiang immediately understood the meaning of this word. After being held for half a day release, he did not go back to his family, he went to the brigade secretary. \\n'Doing said, as long as it is not a personal clinic, it is allowed. I think, just hang up the brand of the brigade medical room, you can't see!' \\n'OK, OK!' Brigade secretary laughing, 'poor farmers see hospital more convenient!' \\nTwo people in one shot. To indicate that all systems were changed, they agreed that the brigade would provide a house, and send a cadre as head of the medical room. Qian mingqiang handed over 60 yuan a month (30 yuan to the brigade, 30 yuan as the person in charge of the miswork subsidy fee). \\nAs a result, the constraints from all sides were definitely removed. Qian mingqiang and the emperor hung the brand of the brigade medical room in the landlord's hall. It also added two wooden beds, a table, a few chairs, and a collective clinic that was so well established. \\n30, signboard change, fame again\\nWith this umbrella brigade, Qian mingqiang let go and dry up. The saying goes: wine is not afraid of the alley deep. His medical technology and his service attitude are already known. The patients in the surrounding village have come, even those who have conditions to go to the big hospital have also flowed to this rudimentary clinic. Qian Ming clang early and fall, done well. Despite the low fees, the income is not thin after a month, deducting the surrender fee. \\nOne day, when he was busy, suddenly came to a group of people, carrying a stretcher with two bamboo loungers, one tired of sweating. Qian mingqiang hurry up. It turned out to be two severely burned boys who were rushed here after they were taken to the county hospital and refused admission. One of the patients named Lin Xinyi, whose head is married swollen like a small bucket, and his eyes can not be opened in the meat. If no action is taken, his life will be difficult. Qian mingqiang made an opportunity to decisively reject the other patients who had been able to join together, and immediately invested in the treatment of these two critically ill patients. He took out his life studies, combined with China and West, nine days and nights, and he was guarded by the patient's side until he spent a dangerous period, eliminated sore, let the patient go home to recuperate, and take care of the patient every few days to change his medicine. Speaking of perhaps people do not believe that the two near-death patients turned out to be completely cured, without leaving a little scar on their face, and it only spent 90 yuan. \\n'Miracle, really miracle!' \\n'Money doctor wonderful hand rejuvenation ah!' \\nAll the peasants in the patient's family, the brigade, are marveling. \\nThe author's assessment of this, according to the heart, is in between believing and not believing. When I heard that one of the patients of the year, Lin Yiyi lived in a fishing village not far from Jinxiang, he wanted to see him, of course, trying to confirm the reality of his treatment. \\nSoong Xiaoxian immediately interviewed the telephone number with Lin Yiyi, and the other party agreed, and soon arrived. The road from the big fishing village to Jinxiang has not yet reached a car. Lin Yiyi walked with his wife and little son, and walked for more than an hour. \\nAlthough more than 20 years have passed, Lin's body was exceptionally strong, and the clean and smooth face could not convince him that he had been severely burned. His wife and children were both respectful and cordial to the Qian family, and there was still a legacy of gratitude for that year. \\nWhen I asked about the burns of that year, Lin Yiyi heard a full smile: 'Comrade, comrade, I was 21 years old. It was when I was young and young, I could not avoid the frizziness. At that time, when my grandmother died, according to the rural rules, to put a flower cannon, because my family was poor, no money to buy, I volunteered to do it myself: with a tin bag cylinder, inside stuffed gunpowder, a burning lead will spell out the spark. I was hit by a hammer a bit, ignited gunpowder, the iron drum exploded, the spark directly into my face, the whole face was burnt, quickly swollen like a small bucket, eyes could not open. The friend who was next to help the bouquet cannon also hurt. This is really called a house leak every night, ah, home can only save people first, and immediately invite people to take us to Pingyang County Hospital for treatment. As soon as I burn this, the doctor shakes his head and said, 'No certainty can be cured, even if you're lucky not to die, but the whole face is scars, consider it yourself! ' As soon as I heard, I was afraid, the first was hospitalization fees, medicine costs, and the second was to leave scars all over my face, and asked me how to be a person in the future? Those who came together said, 'Still go to the doctor for money and see it! He's already a doctor at the Brigade Medical Clinic. A word reminds me, and I promised it immediately. Because at that time, Dr. Qian was already very famous. Just heard that he had been punished for his own medical practice. We didn't dare to go to see him. Now is a legal doctor, why not ask him for medical treatment? That's it, we rushed to the Brigade Medical Room again. Hi, it's really called the forehead bright, meet a good doctor like this, you just look at my face now, and you know his medical clever and unclear!' Lin Yiyi said here in a breath, he showed a big mouth and laughed. \\nOf course, Lin Xinyi also spoke with gratitude about how Dr. Qian worked hard to treat him specifically, and how Qian teacher mother gave him untired and thoughtful care, so that he spent nine days of illness. But he was most thankful for a perfect face, which made him very smooth to marry a beautiful girl and gave birth to him two strong sons, thus having a warm and happy family. \\n'I am now going to go to the sea to fish, and the family is getting richer. If the money doctor saved me, can I have it today? Therefore, I have come to Jinxiang to visit the Qian doctor family every year. We have treated the money family as a loved one!' Lin Yiyi ended our visit with such words. \\nCases similar to the above, endless. There is another case, even more intriguing. \\nOne day, a wife came from the road to the machine. She trembled and picked a tsuta luo toward Jinxiang. Passers-by saw,Turned out,Leg pulled away,Mouths also trembling shouting：'There are ghosts, ghosts!' This has made his wife too inexplicable. And she put down her burden and said loudly, You guys, where are the ghosts of the day? Passers-by lowered and had a bold question: 'You... are you not dead?' My wife understood that the folks actually treated her as a ghost and laughed, 'Am I not living well?' \\nIt turns out that this wife is the mother-in-law of another brigade secretary. Two months ago, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, which is a deadly, intractable disease. When the son-in-law learned the matter, he sent her mother-in-law to a major hospital in Wenzhou to carry out surgery But after surgery, the entire abdominal cavity is inflamed and suppurated. The hospital saw the patient dying, immediately issued an eviction order, and clearly told the family: 'Take home quickly, the faster the better, can't get better than boil the river will be cut off!' The family listened to sending people to advance to J"

				"memoirContent": "inxiang to prepare for the aftermath, on the one hand, put the patient on a long distance car, all the way to the home rush, until through the river, see that the patient has not broken breath, the heart was relieved. Because according to the old rules of the countryside, the villagers died on half the way, they were not allowed to lift back to the village, afraid to provoke many lone ghosts to become Chongcun Fang. \\nAt this time, the brigade secretary spoke: 'I can't always see my mother-in-law death! You go and call Qian mingqiang to see, save it, we can not save us to the piety!' So,Someone rushed to the brigade medical room,Qian mingqiang is the secretary's mother-in-law,Hearts a bit of hair：'I... my family composition is not good, this kind of illness has not seen, get bad...' came to people anxious: 'What do you worry about! The secretary personally asked you to go, you go, not go but not good!' \\nQian mingqiang also makes sense to think about it, just pick up medicine boxes, equipment, hard scalp followed people to the clerk's mother-in-law home. He did not drink water, immediately turned his hands to see the medical record card in the hospital, and checked the wound site, asked the word cut twice, this spit out a sentence: 'Clerk, your mother-in-law is not cancer!' 'What, not cancer? What about your basis?' Both the clerk and his family have come. Qian mingqiang said: 'The old lady has a high white blood cell, which is stated on the hospital laboratory list. Cancer does not have this phenomenon, and the wound has a lot of pus water, odor is heavy, I think it is caused by inflammation of the ovarian cyst!' \\n'Money, Doctor, then ask you to cure!' The families were almost identical. \\nQian mingqiang immediately took hands on the sewing wound sheep intestine line dismantled, when the suture is drawn out, that pus will roll out, enough to have half sputum, smelly smoky, everyone hides the nose. Can Qian Ming Gu not smelly attack, he uses a lot of physiological saline to repeatedly flush the wound, drainage method, until you can not see the pus, and then use Riffan Nesar gauze plug into the wound of anti-inflammatory; at the same time, and hang a large bottle, to large doses of antibiotics, such as red mildew Class drugs eliminate inflammation. Several times a day, he walked to the old lady's house, changed his medicine and rehydration, and he healed up two months later. The whole family, of course, appreciated abnormal. The old lady thought she crossed into the ghost door, but was saved by the money doctor. It was really unrewarding, and mobilized the youngsters to go to the paddy paddy paddy paddy paddy to touch a small tantan snail, and then she personally picked the money family as a gift. So, there was a scene in which the passers-by treated her as a ghost. \\nAs a result, he became famed again and more patients were growing. The town hospital's business is getting lighter and lighter. They reflected to the town government, the mayor could not hang up on his face, specially went to the brigade medical room, and left a sentence: 'It is not in line with the health requirements in this house. If you do not improve the medical environment, it must be stopped!' \\nLand Buddha speak, a word of nine tripod, who dare not from? Even the captain and secretary do not dare to break the pit. 'Money doctor, poor team, I'm afraid it's hard to improve the conditions of the house. What do you see?' \\nObedient, Qian mingqiang is a smart man, knowing that the head of the team does not dare to offend the top supervisor, it seems that there is no way to do it. He understands the location nodded and said, 'I go and think about a way myself, if I can get the house, I want to continue to do it!' 'OK, but the brigade brand don't hang up, there is anything, we will come forward.' \\nHaving said this step, Qian mingqiang had to go. However, he has become unfamiliar with the profession of a doctor, and he cannot fail half the way and fail his folks trust in him. Therefore, he negotiated with his wife, bite his teeth, took out all the savings, and made a patchwork of three or 4,000 yuan. He bought a two-floor two-floor house at the downtown entrance of Jintang town, who lived upstairs and opened a clinic downstairs. \\nThis is how the 'Qian's Medical House' was born. \\n"

His character is haomy, good and straight, wine haoze, bone hot intestine. Top officials celebrities, down to the cold commoner like to interact with him. And he chooses a friend who is the only one who works, regardless of your official or small, whether you are poor and rich, as long as you have real talent and learning, even if you are a cold-door commoner, he also looks good with you. If you are an unskilled grass bag, even if you are in high position, he also sniffers at you. His unique character poured many of today's Baume and Mercier, and most of them are literary Asse, including today's master of national science Wen Huasha also looked at him. \\nIn fact, everyone has a story, but the level of wonderful is different. His life journey is unusual, really can be described as going through twists and tribulations, the last peak turn around, willow. This legendary vivid life is less known. So that everyone who read his unusual life journey legend story, all sigh sigh, implicitly, odd. \\nZhejiang land, hills and downs, the southeast coast of the ancient town of Jinxiang, there is a row of three into the ancient mansion compound. On the right side of the compound there is a clear river winding through. June 20, 1935, when the hot summer weather, the landlord Peng Mingzhang family came out of a loud baby, Xia Jinhua added a boy for Peng's family. This boy is the Qian mingqiang old man who later became the horizon of today's horizon and horizontal poetry. Prior to that, Peng's family had two men and two women. The boy ranked fifth, was the three grandfather of Peng's family. Pang Mingzhang, according to his ancestral 'trillion' generation, meditated and eventually named him Peng Zhaochang. Its intention is also very clear, hoping that his son will make Peng's family thrive again in the future. \\nIn the mid-30s, when the country's poor were weak and natural disasters and disasters, successive. Although Pengjia, a very good local rural village, faced with five wailing children, the burden of life still left Peng Jia unintentional and intolerable pressure. Besides, the sister, Qian Wenji, his wife died and his wife died and was lonely behind them, so after repeated discussions, their couple and wife endured the pain of cutting the three grandfather Peng Zhaochang over to his brother Qian Wenji, who lives in the home home, Qian Wenji. Peng Zhaochang has since changed its name to Qian mingqiang. \\nYoujiayuan and Jin Township belongs to Pingyang County. In June 1981, Cangnan County was established only after it belongs to today's Cangnan County. Jinxiang ancient called Jinzhou, Ming Hongwu 21 years in the foothills of the lion built city, set up Jin Xiang Wei, in order to resist the Japanese Japanese invasion. Therefore, the people of this belt are still Wu Chongwen, the city well is bustling, and the mind is more enlightened. Qian mingqiang's adoptive father Qian Wengui is a celebrity in the local area. \\nQian Wenji, also known as Qian Ruixuan, was born August 20, 1892. Originally the family was destitute, although his father was a handsome and hard-working ordinary farmer, but with ancient Chinese 'all things can be found, only high reading' this Confucianism concept. Therefore, he will save the money he can use to eat and eat and spend, all for his younger son to go to school. \\nSince childhood, Qian Wenji was very useful. Later, it certainly did not live up to the expectations of the last batch of students in the Guangxu year. This brings great glory to the whole family and the whole family. Although the Qing Dynasty was quickly replaced by the government of the Republic of the Republic, the enthusiasm of Youjiayuanmen for Qian Wengui was unabated. When this last generation student went to Beiping University again, villagers used the public welfare money earned by the Qian's clan temple to subsidize the cost of studying. However, his main source of life was due to excellent performance. Different public fees obtained. \\nBeiping University is the birthplace of China's new cultural movement. There have been many great revolutionary pioneers. During his study at this prestigious university, Qian Wenji quickly embraced the idea of progress. He read the law, but both English and Chinese literature were among the best students. He was a delightful man of Peking University Chancellor of Mr. Cai Yuanpei. At that time, the Librarian of Peking University was Mr. Li Dazhao, the pioneer of the proletarian revolution in China, where Comrade Mao Zedong, a great leader of the Chinese people, also served as librarian. He often borrowed progressive books and participated in the May Fourth Movement, which was inseparable from the influence of two revolutionary predecessors on him. After graduating from Peking University, he stayed in school to teach. Later on to Guangdong, he was president of the Provincial High Court and professor of the Law Department of Sun Yat-sen University. It was a small and medium-famous left wing of the Kuomintang. Later, he went to the Ministry of Justice of the Nanjing Government. He also rescued Comrade Lu Dingying, leader of the Communist Party of China. \\nQian Wenji full of longevity, a learning, friendly treatment, for the official Qingzheng. This provides abundant nutrients to the road of money's life. In the long-term common life of the father and son, many of the advantages of Qian Wenji are also inherited by his son invisibly. Qian Wenji understood the law. At that time many famous barristers were his students, there were many guests in and out of the country, and most of them were social celebrities at the time. Qian Wenji also understands medicine. This is the result of studying medical books and medicine books day and night in order to improve his wife's condition during his illness, Peng Meile. After returning to his homeland, he was obliged to visit his folks to see a doctor, so that Qian mingqiang also fell in love with the doctor's practice, and in the aftermath it became a good doctor known from far and near. Many poets and painters in society at that time were friends of Qian Wenji. He also often taught his son to understand the importance of classical poetry and classical literature to Tao Yizhi, which was an enlightening role for Qian mingqiang to Chinese classical literature. In his future life, writing classical poetry became a reality. He felt the lyrical approach of current events, relying on love. \\nQian mingqiang grew up slowly under such favorable conditions. His mind, wisdom and knowledge have given an extraordinary impression from an early age. Village has not yet graduated, he read 'Three Kingdoms', 'Water Margin', 'Journey to the West', 'Thousands of Poems' and other famous Chinese classical literature. Whenever night comes, folks consciously come to the money family, listen to him to tell the story, his intonation, wonderful episodes, rich exaggerated expressions, often make the audience mesmerized, delayed and refused to leave. His memory is particularly strong. The bibliography of the Water Margin 120 times, the name and nickname of the 108 General, turned out to be ripe. He also showed some talent in poetry and was quite aesthetic. Also at the age of eleven, a teacher Shi, who taught drawings, created a national painting with the sun, chick, violet, he once bravely asked a poem above, actually won the great praise of the teacher. From the above points it is not hard to see his talent. Far closer to the neighbor here he is a 'prodigy', will make a difference in the future. \\nGong and gum, firecracker Qiming, in May 1949, Pingyang County liberated. Qian mingqiang, who was 15 years old, coached along with his father and began to embark on a job. Since then actively work and learn hard. From this time onwards, what will be shown in front of him will be an unpredictable life. At the beginning of 1950, the 16-year-old, who was very talented in all respects, became a member of the New Democratic Youth League in Jinxiang District. In 1950, the rural policy was to rectify land, then reduce rent and cut interest rates before land reform. Qian mingqiang moved to the district to work on soil, and also followed the district secretary Ma Benlu around to learn about the situation and guide his work, so that he learned a lot of practical work experience. At that time, cadres were very young and energetic, working almost all day until late at night, but no one was tired; life on weekdays was also very hard, coarse tea, sometimes eaten up, didn't go down, but no one shouted bitter. This mental style is greatly infected with Qian mingqiang. The spleen of Qian mingqiang, who was once a big grandfather, has so far disappeared. What appears in front of people is a young comrade who is angry and young. In just four months, he was transferred to Yanting Township as head of the soil working group and equipped with a gun, in view of his performance and capabilities. Young and well-deserved Qian Mingqianh is windy, hesitant, often received praise and praise from superiors and colleagues. \\nWhen Qian mingqiang was ready to show his hands on the road of life, a change changed his life far, and since then it became ups and downs, twists and twists and twists and tough. In 1950, the township anti-movement in the liberated areas was fully spread out, and the anti-revolutionaries, landlords, bullies and bandits who were grappling with hatred of the people's regime were the first batch of lands to be suppressed. Qian Wenji, who was a senior official in the KMT, was also arrested as a historical counter-revolutionary and held in the district government. Later after a public trial, the people's court sentenced to a two-year suspended death sentence. One of the biggest charges was that he had persecuted Communist Party members while serving as an official in Shanghai. Qian Wenji categorically denied the charge, lodged a complaint and wrote in prison to Comrade Lu Dingyi, who was then the central leader, asking to testify. 'Realistic truth' is a good tradition for communists. A year later, it was certainly confirmed by Comrade Lu Ding, not only did not kill Communist Party members, but also made great efforts to release 7 comrades in prison. The People's Government immediately released Qian Wenji and placed him in his family's rural health hospital. Although his adoptive father was acquitted, in the era of class origin, Qian mingqiang was implicated, not only letting him withdraw, but also left the working group. Later because of the lack of teachers, some people recommended Qian mingqiang, and soon arranged him to serve as General Affairs Director of Caobao Primary School in the 18du Old District, teaching language and music. Qian mingqiang took his work very seriously and responsibly, but also with his excellent literary and artistic talent, actively cooperated with the current affairs education of the situation at that time, compiled blackboard newspapers, singing materials, and performing literary performances as directors. The whole primary school showed a dynamic situation. In the transforming movement, he is more active, motivated and even radical. The most telling of the problem is that he publicly reported that he had separated from his father and son with the historical counter-revolutionary father Qian Wenji. Thanks to his 'ruthless' practice, the money family rightly cut off all financial assistance to him. During his work, he not only worked hard, but also studied himself seriously. He was admitted to Shanghai East China Normal University in the third year. However, due to the cost of living, he was unable to do what he wished, but could only study correspondence professors at work. \\nIt is because of his strict demands that he has done well in all areas, and his work has changed several times. In 1952, he was transferred to Meixi central primary school as teaching director, 1953 was transferred to the difficult conditions of Jingquan primary school as temporary head, in 1956 he was officially appointed as the principal of Jingquan Primary School. He was 22 years old that year. That is, Qian mingqiang was removed from the school as principal for an unexpected 'style of life' issue. In early 1957, in view of his outstanding achievements in teaching and teaching, he was transferred back to Meixi Central Primary School, where he continued to serve as a teacher of teaching, a language teacher and teacher in the middle school. Since his articles were well written, the Teachers newspaper appointed him as editor and correspondent. As a result, he quickly became a leader in the local education community. \\nAmazing good view is not long. In the spring of 1957, the anti-right movement carried out in intellectual and literary circles, after about a year of stormy Xian Li, began to spread to the field of elementary education. His life lanes began to reverse sharply. Qian mingqiang also suffered the brunt of the impact. One day in the first half of 1958, the whole campus was covered in large print newspapers, and the content written above, without exception, was to expose money Mingqiang. 'Qian mingqiang, the piety son of the bureaucratic landlords,' 'Qian mingqiang, a corrupt life,' and 'an anti-socialist Qian mingqiang, an anti-socialist,'... Many charges came out suddenly overnight. The hats of the right were put on so easily. And his crimes are extremely serious: 1, to slander the great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, 2, oppose one-party dictatorship, 3, oppose democratic centralization, 4, anti-socialist cooperative movement, 5 and oppose Sino-Soviet friendship. A big hat clasp on the head of Qian mingqiang, pressing him to breathe. He was surprised: how could he commit so many serious crimes overnight? And all things are nothing, infinite outline, misinterpretation, out of context. He could not accept it. Later, many years later, he learned that the hat of the right was decided to be assigned to him because of the lack of quotas for the right in the commune at that time. This is, of course, extremely closely related to his bad birth. He can no longer engage in the sacred work of the Human Soul Engineer. He was left in school to supervise his labor, the main task being to clean the toilet. In 1958, Qian mingqiang returned to her hometown to visit his family, introduced to meet the current lady Song Xiaoxian. 'She is my life blessing, especially the virtues she showed in my adversity, which makes me never forget!' Qian mingqiang has said this more than once. \\nIn winter 1958, the Great Leap Forward movement began throughout the country. Qian mingqiang and all right-wing elements in Pingyang County were dismissed from public office, sent to rural areas to supervise labor, and participated in major steel making. He had only one thought at that time: again tired of hard work, to try to pick up the hat early, good to tell his wife. Due to his active labor, good human affiliation, cadres of the brigade have treated him as a full member of the team, and assigned him a little bit of his own land according to the rules, allowing him to eat himself and change a little rice oil money. Although the day is hard to clear poverty, but the couple love, rapport, and have a crystalline daughter of love Ruijuan. \\nIn 1963, Wenzhou rural 'three from one package' got hot. Qian mingqiang is not a local rural household, naturally can't be assigned to the land, then another baby son Ruinan (now renamed Yanan), a family of four lives increasingly difficult. In order to survive, Qian mingqiang sold tea business and sold tea to Lanzhou, thousands of miles away. At that time, the State's conduct of 'long-distance trafficking' and 'abandoning agricultural business' was a speculative offence. Qian mingqiang experienced a lot of hard work. He was frozen and starved, only did a few business times and earned hundreds of yuan to maintain a livelihood. This adventure money Ming Clang now in retrospect, still frightened. \\nRed flag show, slogan, big print newspaper overflowing. In 1966, the unprecedented Cultural Revolution began. In that era of swept all the cattle and ghosts, with Qian mingqiang's sensitivity to years of political movement, he felt that a great difficulty was about to come. As the saying goes, 'The good man does not eat his immediate loss', he took the opportunity of the administration at that time to take care of him, leaving his wife who was still in the midst of childbirth, and came to a mess escape. Later it turned out that his escape was correct, otherwise there was a great risk of being killed alive. His father Qian Wenji, who died in this campaign, was devastated by a guerrilla. He has done hard work for his life, selling herbs, tea, raw paint and other sneaky business. Unfortunately, he was caught by the municipal office the following year and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. That day's criticizing congress, people and the sea, a bunch of prisoners, in the slogan of the Shirmatian, bent their heads over and climb up to the bench temporarily set up. The number of people who were battered this time was particularly large. Even handcuffs were not enough. Most of the people who committed their hands were tied back with a coarse rope. One by one, it was finally the turn of Qian mingqiang, he listened upright, like a basin of ice water, drained from head to foot. He turned out to be held on the big charge of 'speculating the bad elements'. The text of the judgment was as follows: 'The right-wing, Qian mingqiang, male, 33 years old, Jinxiang in Pingyang County, Zhejiang, is a filial son and grandson of the bureaucratic landlords. Since the struggle against the right, not honestly accept supervision and transformation, but engage in speculative activities for a long time. From X, 1958 to X, 1967, there were 13 times, making a total of more than $3400. In accordance with article X, paragraph X, of the Criminal Code, the special sentence is seven years' imprisonment. The sentence is from 31 March 1967 to 30 March 1974.' After listening, Qian mingqiang wanted to cry without tears, and secretly set his determination to commit suicide. Just when a team of prisoners tied up hemp rope, was ferry from the river, and the boat to Jiangxin, Qian mingqiang took everyone to jump into the river, did not expect people to sink, the rope was still in the hands of the guards. After Qian mingqiang was pulled on the boat, he was severely beaten for a while. Beginning in Binh Duong Detention Centre for three months, these three months were held alone in a cage less than three square meters, neither standing nor lying, but only half lying there, inside it is damp and mildew, full of unpleasant smell. These three months allowed Qian mingqiang to experience what is called a day as a year. \\nIn July 1967, he was escorted to Jinhua Shilifeng Labour Farm and officially began his reeducation career. Jinhua Shilifeng Farm is a famous labor farm in Zhejiang Province. In the ten miles of loess hills, Pingchou has many plants. If people do not notice that there are high walls, power grids and outposts on the outskirts of a building, it will be mistaken for a bustling township. Here is half a day of labor and half-day study. This is a relatively relaxed day for Qian mingqiang. In a few months, he was also named a learning activist and a labor activist. \\nThe path of life is really unpredictable. Many years later, Qian mingqiang turned out to be a famous doctor in the whole country, and for a long period of years he had not only supported the family, but also laid the foundation for him to start a new career in the future. According to him, 'I am a doctor who was cultivated in a labour farm and received patient recognition in practice.' \\nThe ability to train doctors on a labour farm has to be attributed to a prisoner who is a doctor in itself. The prisoner was named Lin Wenchang. He graduated from Nanjing Medical College. He was assigned to Ningbo Medical University. He was also very handsome. He soon became a professor and director of obstetrics and gynaecology. Young, highly skilled, and many female colleagues and women patients volunteered to embrace, which made him make serious mistakes in gender relations. The physician with extraordinary medical care was sentenced to twenty years in prison. His bunk in the cell just next to Qian mingqiang. When both knew each other's bottom, Qian mingqiang suddenly developed an idea: first, his family was very poor. None of the family was eating a family meal, neither wage income nor labor insurance at all. Now, after going back to school, in the future, the wife and daughter are sick, they will no longer have to spend money to go to a doctor. Second, he learns the hand of medicine, and can be a barefoot doctor when you go back, saying it may be better than them, so that they can often serve poor farmers, and can also be less criticized. Once the idea is attached to the action, Qian mingqiang chew the medical books, medicine books brought by Lin Wenchang and wrote to her wife, asking her to buy some medical books to facilitate learning. When Lin Wenchang treats sick inmates, he actively assisted Lin Wenchang in painting red mercury, wipe iodine wine and needles. Hang large bottles and other dirty live. In this way, he learned a set of medical techniques, and not only gained the respect of inmates, but also became a means for his future and capital for his career. \\nOn March 30, 1974, the spring began, Qian mingqiang finally struggled, survived his seven years of iron window career, and also ushered in his spring-to complete his sentence of release. He is a rare talent. Ten Li Feng Farm leaders have repeatedly welcomed him to stay as a doctor. Those who have completed their sentences have all the rights and obligations of Chinese citizens and are also able to receive more than 30 yuan of wages per month. This was not a small number at that time, but the official cadres of the country had a lot lower than his salary, while those who could pay 30 yuan or more were flawed. Moreover, vegetables, meat, poultry eggs are cheap, and the breadwinner is more than enough. Although he had some heart, he gave up their retention for the sake of his family. Chunyang shone, Yingfei grass long, he picked a bunch of linen, which was loaded with medical equipment and books, embarked on the road of hometown. By train, by car, mountain a way, water, closer to home, return to heart more cut. Don't come back, the scene is naturally delighted, their whole family cry, Qian Ming crying is more old tears, choking: 'From now on I will redouble my efforts, let my wife and children live a good day.' That day, the couple sleepless overnight, and Qian Ming quietly listened to the wife's talk. How hard she was to hold up this home. Qian mingqiang now praises his wife whenever he refers to his wife, saying that his biggest gain in his life is having such a wise and competent wife. \\nIn July 1974, the summer summer came, when people were sweaty walking on the streets of Jinxiang, they were surprised and surprised to find under the roof of the street, a table, a stethoscope, blood pressure syringe and some Chinese and Western medicines. A burdensome lang sitting at the table is giving the patient a vigorous consultation. Qian mingqiang treats patients very kindly, asking, smelling, looking out, meticulous, how to use the medicine is even more clear, plus he will play muscular needles, and he will hang brine water. This is a great technology in Jintang, where medicine was scarce at that time, and he often took the initiative to visit service. As a result, Dr. Qian's name began to pass to the streets and alleys, and even many rural people came to the clinic. After a period of practice in medicine, Qian mingqiang has won a good reputation with excellent medical techniques, reasonable fees, serious and responsible attitude. One day came a patient with a pause caused by sputum obstruction, in the absence of a sputum device in the critical situation, Qian mingqiang did not hesitate to bend to the old man, mouth-to-mouth hard suck, mouthed and thick sputum suck out of his mouth, to the fifth mouth, only saw the old man issued one Long moan, breathing smoothly, and the face slowly turns to normal. The patient's family 'flutter' kneeling on the ground: 'Money doctor, my father's life is giving, we can't forget you all the life!' The most typical thing is a patient called Lin Kaileng, because he was sent to gunpowder burns, the head was swollen like a small bucket, and his eyes could not be opened in meat. If no measures were taken, his life would be hard to protect. Qian mingqiang made an opportunity to decisively reject the rest of the patients who had been able to attend, and immediately invested in the treatment of this critically ill patient. He took out his life studies, combined with China and West, nine days and nights, and he was guarded by the patient's side until he spent a dangerous period, eliminated sore, let the patient go home to recuperate, and take care of the patient every few days to change his medicine. Speaking of perhaps people do not believe that the dying patient turned out to be completely cured, without leaving a little scar on his face, and it only spent 90 yuan. Lin Kai-kai now says that Qian mingqiang is his lifesaving man, unforgettable life, most thankful is also a perfect face, so that he successfully marries a beautiful girl as a wife and gave birth to him two strong sons, thus having a warm and happy family. These cases are so numerous and endless. Later, Qian mingqiang changed from a small clinic to the 'Qian's Hospital', and became a brand known to women and children in Jintung Township. Of course, Qian mingqiang also accumulated the first bucket of gold in his life. \\nIn 1978, the spring breeze of reform and opening up blew green both sides of the river. With his own smart mind, Qian mingqiang felt people's increasing demand for information, immediately founded the country's first rural science and technology information association-Cangnan County Jin Township Science and Technology Economic Information Association and the country's first rural information newspaper-Jin Jin Township Information newspaper. Driven by information, Jinxiang small commodity production flourished, becoming the birthplace of Wenzhou model.

The title of his 'Small Commodities, Big Market', 'Dare to Eat First, Brave the World First' thesis title, later quoted by Fei Xiaotong and even newspapers across the country. He is also obliged to provide rich information to all parts of the country and is often invited to give information exchange and lectures.
